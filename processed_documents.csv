https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 2/68CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once  or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
“without pictures or conversations?”
So she was consider ing in her own mind (as well as she could, for
the hot day made her feel very sleep y and stupid), whether the
pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of
getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit
with pink eyes ran close by her . There was nothing so very remarkab le in that; nor did Alice think
it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh
dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket , and looked at it, and then hurried
on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity , she ran across the
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
large rabbit-hole under the hedge. In another moment down went Alice after it, never once
considering how in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and
then dipped suddenly down, so sudd enly that Alice had not a
moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself
falling down a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly , for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder
what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and
make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see
anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that
they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she
saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from
one of the shelves  as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE
MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she
did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath,
so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. “Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after  such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think
me at home! Why , I wouldn’ t say anyth ing about it, even if I fell off
the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 3/68Down, down, down. Would the fall never  come to an end? “I
wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I
must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see:
that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see,
Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the
schoolroom, and though this was not a very good  opportunity for
showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still
it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right
distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got
to?” (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either , but
thought they were nice grand words to say .)
Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through
the earth!","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that
walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she
was rather  glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’ t
sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the
name of the country is, you know . Please, Ma’am, is this New
Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy
curtseying  as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could
manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for
asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up
somewhere.”
Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon
began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should
think!” (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of
milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear!","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"I wish you were down here with
me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a
bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know . But do cats eat bats, I
wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy , and went on
saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats
eat bats?”  and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she
couldn’ t answer either question, it didn’ t much matter which way she
put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream
that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her
very earne stly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a
bat?” when suddenly , thump! thump!","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"down she came upon a heap of
sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over . Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a
moment: she looked  up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was
another long passage, and the White  Rabbit was still in sight,
hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went
Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a
corner , “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was
close behind it when she turned the corner , but the Rabbit was no
longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit
up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and
when Alice had been all the way down  one side and up the other ,
trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering
how she was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of
solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and
Alice’ s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 4/68the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too
small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However , on the
second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed
before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she
tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it
fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage,
not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to
get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of
bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get
her head through the doorway; “and even if my head would go
through,” thought poor Alice, “it would  be of very little use without
my should ers. Oh, how I wish I could  shut up like a telescope! I
think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many
out-of-the-way thing s had happened lately, that Alice had begun to
think that very few things indeed were really impossible. There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she
went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it,
or at any rate a book of rules for shuttin g people up like telescopes:
this time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here
before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large
letters. It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice
was not going to do that in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,
“and see whether it’s marked ‘poison ’ or not”; for she had read
several nice little histories about child ren who had got burnt, and
eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
would  not remem ber the simple rules their friends had taught them:
such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;
and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually
bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,
sooner or later . However , this bottle was not marked “poison,” so Alice ventured
to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey , toffee, and
hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it of f. *      *      *      *      *      *      *

“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a
telescope.”
And so it was indee d: she was now only ten inches high, and her
face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for
going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however ,
she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any
further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 5/68know ,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether , like a
candle. I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy
what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for
she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while, findin g that nothing more  happened, she decided on
going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got
to the door, she found she had forgotte n the little golden key, and
when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not
possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and
she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was
too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor
little thing sat down and cried. “Come, there’ s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,
rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally
gave herse lf very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for
having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against
herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two
people. “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be
two peopl e! Why , there’ s hardly enough of me left to make one
respectable person!”
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the
table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the
words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat
it,” said Alice, “and  if it makes me grow  larger, I can reach the key;
and if it makes me grow smaller , I can creep under the door; so either
way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’ t care which happens!”
She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which
way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she
remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one
eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting
nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite
dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way . So she set to work, and very soon finished of f the cake. *      *      *      *      *      *      *

“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much
surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good
English); “now I’m opening out like the largest telescope that ever
was! Good -bye, feet!” (for when she looked down at her feet, they
seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). “Oh,
my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and
stockings for you now, dears? I’m sure I shan’ t be able! I shall be a
great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage
the best way you can;—but I must be kind to them,” thought Alice,
“or perhaps they won’t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I’ll
give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.”
And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must go by the carrier ,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll
seem, sending presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the
directions will look! Alice’s Right Foot, Esq.,
       Hearthrug,
         near the Fender,
           ( with Alice’s love ). Oh dear , what nonsense I’m talking!”
Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she
was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little
golden key and hurried of f to the garden door . Poor Alice ! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one
side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through
was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again. “You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl
like you,”  (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same,
shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her,
about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves
in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a
great hurry , muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the
Duchess! Oh! won’ t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice
felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when
the Rabbit  came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you
please, sir—” The Rabbit started violently , dropped the white kid
gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he
could go.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 7/68Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanni ng herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear , dear! How queer everything is to-day!","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"And yesterday things went on just
as usual. I wonder if I’ve been changed  in the night? Let me think:
was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can
remember feeling a little different.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"But if I’m not the same, the next
question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s the great puzzle!” And
she began thinking over all the childre n she knew that were of the
same age as herself,  to see if she could have been changed for any of
them. “I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesn’ t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t be
Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
very little!","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"Besides, she’s she, and I’m I, and—o h dear, how puzzling
it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things  I used to know .","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"Let me see:
four times  five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four
times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However , the Multiplication Table doesn’ t signify: let’s try
Geography . London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
Rome, and Rome—no, that’s all wrong, I’m certain! I must have
been chan ged for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘How doth the little—’” and
she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and
began to repeat it, but her voice sounded  hoarse and strange, and the
words did not come the same as they used to do:—
“How doth the little crocodile
    Improve his shining tail,
And pour the waters of the Nile
    On every golden scale! “How cheerfully he seems to grin,
    How neatly spread his claws,
And welcome little fishes in
    With gently smiling jaws!”
“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her
eyes filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after
all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have
next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down
here! It’ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come
up again, dear!’  I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me
that first, and then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll
stay down here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice,
with a sudden burst  of tears, “I do wish they would  put their heads
down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!”
As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised
to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit’ s little white kid gloves
while she was talking.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"“How can I have done that?” she thought. “I
must be growing small again.” She got up and went to the table to
measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess,
she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking
rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 8/68holding, and she dropped it hastily , just in time to avoid shrinking
away altogether . “That was a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at
the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence;
“and now for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the
little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little
golden key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are
worse than ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as
this before, never! And I declare it’ s too bad, that it is!”
As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,
splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that
she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back
by railway ,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once
in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever
you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing
machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden
spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway
station.) However , she soon made out that she was in the pool of
tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. “I wish I hadn’ t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about,
trying to find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose,
by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be
sure! However , everything is queer to-day .”
Just then she heard something splashing  about in the pool a little
way off, and she swam nearer to make  out what it was: at first she
thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she
remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it
was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself. “Would it be of any use, now,” though t Alice, “to speak to this
mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-wa y down here, that I should
think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there’ s no harm in trying.”
So she began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I
am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought
this must be the right way of speaking  to a mouse: she had never
done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her
brother ’s Latin Grammar , “A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a
mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively ,
and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said
nothing. “Perhaps it doesn’ t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay
it’s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror .” (For,
with all her knowledge of history , Alice had no very clear notion how
long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma
chatte?” which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The
Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water , and seemed to quiver all
over with fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily , afraid
that she had hurt the poor animal’ s feelings. “I quite forgot you
didn’ t like cats.”
“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would you like cats if you were me?”
“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’ t be angry
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 9/68you’d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a
dear quiet  thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily
about in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking
her paws and washi ng her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to
nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg
your pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was
bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We
won’ t talk about her any more if you’d rather not.”
“We indee d!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the
end of his tail. “As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family
always hated  cats: nasty , low, vulgar things! Don’ t let me hear the
name again!”
“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject
of conver sation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The
Mouse did not answer , so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a
nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little
bright-eyed terrier , you know , with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch thing s when you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg
for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I can’t remember half of them
—and it belongs to a farmer , you know , and he says it’s so useful, it’s
worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!”
cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, “I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!”
For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go,
and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again,
and we won’ t talk about cats or dogs either , if you don’t like them!”
When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back
to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it
said in a low trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll
tell you my history , and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and
dogs.”
It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with
the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a
Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way , and the whole party swam to the shore.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 10/68CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
They were indeed a queer -looking party that assembled on the
bank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur
clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and
uncomfortable. The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she
had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument
with the Lory , who at last turned sulky , and would only say, “I am
older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not
allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively
refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said. At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among
them, called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I’ll soon
make you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring,
with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on
it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry
very soon. “Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know .","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"Silence all round, if you please! ‘William the Conqueror , whose cause was favoured by the pope, was
soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been
of late much accustomed to usurpatio n and conquest. Edwin and
Morcar , the earls of Mercia and Northumbria—’”
“Ugh!” said the Lory , with a shiver . “I beg your pardon! ” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely:
“Did you speak?”
“Not I!” said the Lory hastily . “I thought you did,” said the Mouse.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"“—I proceed. ‘Edwin and
Morcar , the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and
even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury , found it
advisable—’”
“Found what ?” said the Duck. “Found it,” the Mouse replied  rather crossly: “of course you know
what ‘it’  means.”
“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when I find a thing,” said
the Duck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did
the archbishop find?”
The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,
“‘—found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William
and offer him the crown. William’ s conduct at first was moderate.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 11/68But the insolence of his Normans—’  How are you getting on now,
my dear?” it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke. “As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’ t
seem to dry me at all.”
“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly , rising to its feet, “I move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more
energetic remedies—”
“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of
half those  long words, and, what’ s more, I don’t believe you do
either!” And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of
the other birds tittered audibly . “What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone,
“was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”
“What is a Caucus- race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to
know , but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody  ough t
to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything. “Why ,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.”
(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I
will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)
First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact
shape doesn’ t matter ,” it said,) and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and
away ,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when
they liked , so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However , when they had been running half an hour or so, and were
quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!”
and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has
won?”
This question the Dodo could not answ er without a great deal of
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its
forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the
pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo
said, “ Everybody  has won, and all must have prizes.”
“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked. “Why , she, of course ,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in
a confused way , “Prizes! Prizes!”
Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in
her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water
had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was
exactly one a-piece, all round. “But she must have a prize herself, you know ,” said the Mouse. “Of course ,” the Dodo replied very gravely . “What else have you
got in your pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice. “Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly . “Hand it over here,” said the Dodo. Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo
solemnly presented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of
this elegant thimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech,
they all cheered.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 12/68Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so
grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of
anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as
solemn as she could. The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and the smal l ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However , it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
begged the Mouse to tell them something more. “You prom ised to tell me your history , you know ,” said Alice,
“and why it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper , half
afraid that it would be of fended again. “Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice,
and sighing. “It is a long tail, certainly ,” said Alice, looking down with wonder
at the Mouse’ s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on
puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of
the tale was something like this:—
         “Fury said to a
         mouse, That he
        met in the
       house,
     ‘Let us
      both go to
       law: I will
        prosecute
         you.—Come,
           I’ll take no
           denial; We
          must have a
        trial: For
      really this
     morning I’ve
    nothing
    to do.’
      Said the
      mouse to the
       cur, ‘Such
        a trial,
         dear sir,
            With
          no jury
        or judge,
       would be
      wasting
      our
      breath.’
        ‘I’ll be
        judge, I’ll
         be jury,’
             Said
         cunning
          old Fury:
          ‘I’ll
          try the
            whole
            cause,
              and

          to
           death.’”
“You are not attendi ng!” said the Mous e to Alice severely . “What
are you thinking of?”
“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the
fifth bend, I think?”
“I had not!” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily . “A knot!”  said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and
looking anxiously about her . “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”
“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and
walking away . “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”
“I didn’ t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily
offended, you know!”
The Mouse only growled in reply . “Please come back and finish your story !” Alice called after it; and
the others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only
shook its head impatiently , and walked a little quicker . “What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory , as soon as it was
quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to
her daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
your temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little
snappishly . “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”
“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,
addressing nobody in particular . “She’d soon fetch it back!”
“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said
the Lory . Alice replied eagerl y, for she was always ready to talk about her
pet: “Dinah’ s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice
you can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why , she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”
This speec h caused a remarkable sensation among the party . Some
of the birds hurried  off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping
itself up very carefully , remarking, “I really must be getting home;
the night- air doesn’ t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a
trembling voice to its children, “Come away , my dears! It’s high time
you were all in bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and
Alice was soon left alone. “I wish I hadn’ t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a
melancholy tone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m
sure she’s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I
shall ever see you any more!” And here poor Alice began to cry
again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while,
however , she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the
distance, and she looked up eagerly , half hoping that the Mouse had
changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story .6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 14/68CHAPTER IV . The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
it muttering to itself  “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws!","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"Oh my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets
are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice
guessed in a momen t that it was looking for the fan and the pair of
white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about
for them, but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to
have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the
glass table and the little door , had vanished completely . Very soon  the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,
and called  out to her in an angry tone, “Why , Mary Ann, what are
you doing  out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of
gloves and a fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened
that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to
explain the mistake it had made. “He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"“How surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better
take him his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said
this, she came upon  a neat little house, on the door of which was a
bright brass plate with the name “W. RABBIT ,” engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest
she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house
before she had found the fan and gloves. “How queer it seems ,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages
for a rabbit! I suppo se Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!”
And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss
Alice! Com e here directly , and get ready  for your walk!’  ‘Coming in
a minute, nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’ t get out.’
Only I don’t think,”  Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the
house if it began ordering people about like that!”
By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a
table in the window , and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or
three pairs  of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of
the gloves , and was just going to leave  the room, when her eye fell
upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no
label this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she
uncorked it and put it to her lips. “I know something  interesting is
sure to happen,” she said to herself,  “whenever I eat or drink
anything; so I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make
me grow large again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny
little thing!”6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 15/68It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before
she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the
ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She
hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself “That’ s quite enough—I
hope I shan’ t grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I
do wish I hadn’ t drunk quite so much!”
Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and
growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another
minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of
lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm
curled round her head. Still she went  on growing, and, as a last
resource, she put one arm out of the window , and one foot up the
chimney , and said to herself “Now I can do no more, whatever
happens. What will become of me?”
Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full
effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and,
as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the
room again, no wonder she felt unhappy . “It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one
wasn’ t always growing larger and smal ler, and being ordered about
by mice and rabbits . I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-
hole—and yet—and  yet—it’ s rather curious, you know , this sort of
life! I do wonder what can have happened to me! When I used to
read fairy- tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now
here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written
about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I’ll write one—but
I’m grown up now,” she added in a sorrowful tone; “at least there’ s
no room to grow up any more here.”
“But then, ” thought  Alice, “shall I never  get any older than I am
now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—
but then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’ t like that! ”
“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you
learn lesso ns in here? Why , there’ s hardl y room for you, and no room
at all for any lesson-books!”
And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other , and
making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes
she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen. “Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this
moment!” Then came a little pattering  of feet on the stairs. Alice
knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till
she shook  the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a
thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid
of it. Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but,
as the door opened  inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard
against it, that attempt proved a failure . Alice heard it say to itself
“Then I’ll go round and get in at the window .”
“That you won’ t!” though t Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
she heard the Rabbi t just under the window , she suddenly spread out
her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of
anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 16/68broken glass, from which she conclude d that it was just possible it
had fallen into a cucumber -frame, or something of the sort. Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’ s—“Pat! Pat! Where are
you?” And then a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m
here! Digging for apples, yer honour!”
“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily . “Here! Come and help me out of this!” (Sounds of more broken glass.)
“Now tell me, Pat, what’ s that in the window?”
“Sure, it’ s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)
“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why , it fills the
whole window!”
“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’ s an arm for all that.”
“Well, it’ s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”
There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear
whispers now and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour , at
all, at all!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out
her hand again, and made another snatc h in the air. This time there
were two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a
number of cucumber -frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I
wonder what they’ll  do next!","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"As for pulling me out of the window , I
only wish they could! I’m sure I don’t want to stay in here any
longer!”
She waite d for some time without hearing anything more: at last
came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many
voices all talking together: she made out the words: “Where’ s the
other ladder?—Why , I hadn’ t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—
Bill! fetch  it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em
together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh!","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"they’ll do
well enoug h; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope
—W ill the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming
down! Heads below!” (a loud crash)—“ Now , who did that?—It was
Bill, I fancy—Who’ s to go down the chimney?—Nay , I shan’t! You
do it!—That I won’ t, then!—B ill’s to go down— Here, Bill! the
master says you’re to go down the chimney!”
“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney , has he?” said Alice
to herself. “Shy , they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’ t be
in Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow , to be sure; but
I think  I can kick a little!”
She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and
waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn’ t guess of what sort it
was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above
her: then, saying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick,
and waited to see what would happen next. The first thing she heard was a gener al chorus of “There goes
Bill!” then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the
hedge!” then silence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold
up his head—Brandy now—Don’ t choke him—How was it, old
fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!”
Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’ s Bill,” thought
Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more , thank ye; I’m better now—6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 17/68but I’m a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something
comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”
“So you did, old fellow!” said the others. “We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’ s voice; and
Alice called out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at
you!”
There was a dead silence instantly , and Alice thought to herself, “I
wonder what they will do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the
roof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
Alice heard the Rabbit say , “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”
“A barrow ful of what? ” thought Alice; but she had not long to
doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in
at the window , and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop
to this,” she said to herself, and shoute d out, “You’d better not do
that again!” which produced another dead silence. Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning
into little cakes as they lay on the floor , and a bright idea came into
her head. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make
some  change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it
must make me smaller , I suppose.”
So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that
she began shrinking directly . As soon as she was small enough to get
through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd
of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard,
Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were
giving it something out of a bottle. They  all made a rush at Alice the
moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon
found herself safe in a thick wood.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she
wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and
the second  thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think
that will be the best plan.”
It sounded  an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously
among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look
up in a great hurry . An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round
eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"“Poor
little thing !” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to
whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the
thought that it might be hungry , in which  case it would be very likely
to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing. Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick,
and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the
air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the
stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great
thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she
appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick,
and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice,
thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and
expecting every moment to be trampled  under its feet, ran round the6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 18/68thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the
stick, running a very little way forward s each time and a long way
back, and barking hoarsely all the while,  till at last it sat down a good
way off, panting, with its tongue hangi ng out of its mouth, and its
great eyes half shut. This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;
so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of
breath, and till the puppy’ s bark sounded quite faint in the distance. “And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
leaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d
only been the right size to do it! Oh dear!","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"I’d nearly forgotten that
I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how is it to be managed? I
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
question is, what?”
The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her
at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything
that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the
circumstances. Ther e was a large mushroom growing near her, about
the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on
both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as
well look and see what was on the top of it. She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue
caterpillar , that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly
smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or
of anything else.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 19/68CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and
addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. “Who are you? ” said the Caterpillar . This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice
replied, rather shyly , “I—I hardly know , sir, just at present—at least I
know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have
been changed several times since then.”
“What do you mean  by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly . “Explain
yourself!”
“I can’t explain myself , I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m
not myself, you see.”
“I don’ t see,” said the Caterpillar . “I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly ,” Alice replied very politely ,
“for I can’t understa nd it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing.”
“It isn’ t,” said the Caterpillar . “Well, perhaps you haven’ t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when
you have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—
and then after that into a butterfly , I should think you’ll feel it a little
queer , won’ t you?”
“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar . “Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I
know is, it would feel very queer to me.”
“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously . “Who are you? ”
Which brought them back again to the beginning of the
conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar ’s making
such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very
gravely , “I think, you ought to tell me who you are, first.”
“Why?” said the Caterpillar . Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think
of any good reason, and as the Caterp illar seemed to be in a very
unpleasant state of mind, she turned away . “Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something
important to say!”
This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back
again. “Keep your temper ,” said the Caterpillar . “Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 20/68“No,” said the Caterpillar . Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to
do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it
unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said,
“So you think you’re changed, do you?”
“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I
used—and I don’ t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”
“Can’ t remember what  things?” said the Caterpillar . “Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all
came dif ferent!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice. “Repeat, “ You ar e old, Father W illiam ,’” said the Caterpillar . Alice folded her hands, and began:—
“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,
    “And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head—
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”
“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,
    “I feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again.”
“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—
    Pray, what is the reason of that?”
“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
    “I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—
    Allow me to sell you a couple?”
“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak
    For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—
    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”
“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,
    And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life.”
“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose
    That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—
    What made you so awfully clever?”
“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”
    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs! Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”
“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar .6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 21/68“Not quite  right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly ; “some of the
words have got altered.”
“It is wrong from  beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar
decidedly , and there was silence for some minutes. The Caterpillar was the first to speak. “What size do you want to be?” it asked. “Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice  hastily replied; “only one
doesn’ t like changing so often, you know .”
“I don’t know ,” said the Caterpillar . Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in
her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper . “Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar . “Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn’ t mind,”
said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”
“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily ,
rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high). “But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And
she thoug ht of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’ t be so easily
offended!”
“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again. This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a
minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and
yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it
went, “One side will make you grow taller , and the other side will
make you grow shorter .”
“One side of what? The other side of what? ” thought Alice to
herself. “Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar , just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight. Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a
minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it
was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However , at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would
go, and broke of f a bit of the edge with each hand. “And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little
of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a
violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot! She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but
she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking
rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"Her
chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly
room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to
swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit. *      *      *      *      *      *      *

“Come, my head’ s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight,
which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that
her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she
looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise
like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her . “What can all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where have
my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see
you?” She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result
seemed to follow , except a little shaking among the distant green
leaves. As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her
head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to
find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a
serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful
zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found
to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been
wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large
pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its
wings. “Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon. “I’m not a serpent!” said Alice indignantly . “Let me alone!”
“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued
tone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and
nothing seems to suit them!”
“I haven’ t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice. “I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried
hedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those
serpents! There’ s no pleasing them!”
Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no
use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished. “As if it wasn’ t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the
Pigeon; “but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why , I haven’ t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”
“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was
beginning to see its meaning. “And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down
from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”
“But I’m not a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”
“Well! What  are you?”  said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to
invent something!”
“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully , as she
remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day . “A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeo n in a tone of the deepest
contempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
one with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’ s no6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 23/68use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never
tasted an egg!”
“I have  tasted eggs, certainly ,” said Alice, who was a very truthful
child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know .”
“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then
they’re a kind of serpent, that’ s all I can say .”
This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding,
“You’re looking for eggs, I know that well enough; and what does it
matter to me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”
“It matter s a good deal to me,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not
looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’ t want yours :
I don’ t like them raw .”
“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as
well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the
branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of
mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully , nibbling
first at one and then at the other , and growing sometimes taller and
sometimes shorter , until she had succee ded in bringing herself down
to her usual height. It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that
it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
and began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’ s half my plan
done now! How puzzling all these changes are!","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"I’m never sure what
I’m going to be, from one minute to another! However , I’ve got back
to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—
how is that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came
suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet
high. “Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come
upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!”
So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture
to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches
high.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 24/68CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper
For a minu te or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering
what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running
out of the wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he
was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have
called him a fish)— and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery , with a round face, and
large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had
powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious
to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood
to listen. The Fish-F ootman began by producing from under his arm a great
letter , nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other ,
saying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the
Queen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same
solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the
Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”
Then they both bowed low , and their curls got entangled together . Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the
wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near
the door , staring stupidly up into the sky . Alice went timidly up to the door , and knocked. “There’ s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that
for two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as
you are; secondly , because they’re making such a noise inside, no
one could possibly hear you.” And certainly there was a most
extraordinary noise going on within—a constant howling and
sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle
had been broken to pieces. “Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”
“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went
on without attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For
instance, if you were inside , you might knock, and I could let you
out, you know .” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was
speaking, and this Alice thought decide dly uncivil. “But perhaps he
can’t help it,” she said to herself; “his eyes are so very nearly at the
top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How
am I to get in?” she repeated, aloud. “I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”
At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate
came skim ming out, straight at the Footman’ s head: it just grazed his
nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 25/68“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone,
exactly as if nothing had happened. “How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone. “Are you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’ s the first
question, you know .”
It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really
dreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue. It’s enough to drive one crazy!”
The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for
repeating his remark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on
and of f, for days and days.”
“But what am I to do?” said Alice. “Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling. “Oh, there ’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately:
“he’s perfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in. The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke
from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged
stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the
fire, stirring a lar ge cauldron which seemed to be full of soup. “There’ s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to
herself, as well as she could for sneezing. There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess
sneezed occasionall y; and as for the baby , it was sneezing and
howling alternately without a moment’ s pause. The only things in the
kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was
sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear . “Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly , for she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first,
“why your cat grins like that?”
“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’ s why . Pig!”
She said the last word with such sudden  violence that Alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another momen t that it was addressed to the
baby , and not to her , so she took courage, and went on again:—
“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’ t
know that cats could  grin.”
“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”
“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely , feeling
quite pleased to have got into a conversation. “You don’ t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’ s a fact.”
Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it
would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of
soup off the fire, and at once set to work  throwing everything within
her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first;
then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The
Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby
was howling so much already , that it was quite impossible to say
whether the blows hurt it or not. “Oh, please  mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and
down in an agony of terror . “Oh, there goes his precious  nose!” as an6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 26/68unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it
off. “If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a
hoarse growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”
“Which would not be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very
glad to get an oppo rtunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! You
see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”
“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop of f her head!”
Alice glanced rather  anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to
take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed
not to be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I
think ; or is it twelve? I—”
“Oh, don’t bother me,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide
figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a
sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the
end of every line:
“Speak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
He only does it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases.”
CHORUS. (In which the cook and the baby joined):
“Wow! wow! wow!”
While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept
tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing
howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:—
“I speak severely to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes;
For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases!”
CHORUS. “Wow!","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
wow!,"Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"wow!”
“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to
Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready
to play croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just
missed her . Alice caught the baby with some difficulty , as it was a queer -
shaped little creature , and held out its arms and legs in all directions,
“just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was
snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling
itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether , for the
first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it. As soon as she had made out the proper  way of nursing it, (which
was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 27/68right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried
it out into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,”
thought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’ t it be
murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the
little thing  grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). “Don’ t grunt,” said Alice; “that’ s not at all a proper way of
expressing yourself.”
The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its
face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that
it had a very turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose;
also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether
Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was
only sobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if
there were any tears. No, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my
dear,” said Alice, seriously , “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was
impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in
silence. Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now , what am I to
do with this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so
violently , that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time
there could  be no mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a
pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it
further . So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it
trot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to
herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other
children she knew , who might do very well as pigs, and was just
saying to herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—”
when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a
bough of a tree a few yards of f. The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured,
she though t: still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so
she felt that it ought to be treated with respect. “Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly , as she did not at all
know whether it would like the name: however , it only grinned a
little wider . “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went
on. “W ould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the
Cat. “I don’ t much care where—” said Alice. “Then it doesn’ t matter which way you go,” said the Cat. “—so long as I get somewher e,” Alice added as an explanation. “Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long
enough.”
Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
question. “What sort of people live about here?”
“In that direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives
a Hatter: and in that direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a March6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 28/68Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”
“But I don’ t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked. “Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m
mad. You’re mad.”
“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice. “You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’ t have come here.”
Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however , she went on “And
how do you know that you’re mad?”
“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’ s not mad. You grant that?”
“I suppose so,” said Alice. “Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s
angry , and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now I growl when I’m
pleased, and wag my tail when I’m angry . Therefore I’m mad.”
“I call it purring, not growling,” said Alice. “Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with
the Queen to-day?”
“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’ t been
invited yet.”
“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished. Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to
queer things happening.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"While she was looking at the place where it
had been, it suddenly appeared again. “By-the-bye, what became of the baby? ” said the Cat. “I’d nearly
forgotten to ask.”
“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
in a natural way . “I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again. Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
appear , and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
which the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,”
she said to hersel f; “the March Hare will be much the most
interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won’ t be raving mad—at
least not so mad as it was in March.” As she said this, she looked up,
and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree. “Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat. “I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’ t keep
appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy .”
“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly ,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone. “Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a
grin without a cat! It’ s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”
She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the
house of the March Hare: she thought  it must be the right house,
because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was
thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go
nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of
mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she
walked up towards it rather timidly , saying to herself “Suppose it6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll

Hatter instead!”6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 30/68CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party
There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were havin g tea at it: a Dormouse was
sitting betw een them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only , as it’s
asleep, I suppose it doesn’ t mind.”
The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together
at one corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they
saw Alice coming. “There’ s plenty  of room!” said Alice indignantly ,
and she sat down in a lar ge arm-chair at one end of the table. “Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone. Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but
tea. “I don’ t see any wine,” she remarked. “There isn’ t any ,” said the March Hare. “Then it wasn’ t very civil of you to of fer it,” said Alice angrily . “It wasn’ t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,”
said the March Hare. “I didn’ t know it was your table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great
many more than three.”
“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at
Alice for some time with great curiosity , and this was his first
speech. “You shou ld learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with
some severity; “it’ s very rude.”
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he
said was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”
“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad
they’ve begun asking riddles.—I believe  I can guess that,” she added
aloud. “Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?”
said the March Hare. “Exactly so,” said Alice. “Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on. “I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I say
—that’ s the same thing, you know .”
“Not the same thing  a bit!” said the Hatter . “You might just as well
say that ‘I see what I eat’  is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”
“You migh t just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like
what I get’  is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 31/68“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to
be talking  in his sleep, “that ‘I breath e when I sleep’  is the same
thing as ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”
“It is the same thing with you,” said the Hatter , and here the
conversation droppe d, and the party sat silent for a minute, while
Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-
desks, which wasn’ t much. The Hatte r was the first to break the silence.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"“What day of the
month is it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of
his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily , shaking it every now and
then, and holding it to his ear . Alice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”
“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter . “I told you butter wouldn’ t
suit the works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare. “It was the best butter ,” the March Hare meekly replied. “Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter
grumbled: “you shouldn’ t have put it in with the bread-knife.”
The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he
dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could
think of nothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the best
butter , you know .”
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity . “What a funny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month,
and doesn’ t tell what o’clock it is!”
“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter . “Does your watc h tell you
what year it is?”
“Of cours e not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it
stays the same year for such a long time together .”
“Which is just the case with mine ,” said the Hatter . Alice felt dreadfully  puzzled. The Hatte r’s remark seemed to have
no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t
quite understand you,” she said, as politely as she could. “The Dorm ouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter , and he poured a
little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its head impatiently , and said, without
opening its eyes, “Of course, of cours e; just what I was going to
remark myself.”
“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to
Alice again. “No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’ s the answer?”
“I haven’ t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter . “Nor I,” said the March Hare. Alice sighed wearily . “I think you might do something better with
the time,”  she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no
answers.”
“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter , “you wouldn’ t
talk about wasting it. It’s him.”
“I don’ t know what you mean,” said Alice.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 32/68“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head
contemptuously . “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”
“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat
time when I learn music.”
“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter . “He won’ t stand
beating. Now , if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do
almost anything you liked with the clock.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"For instance, suppose it
were nine o’clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d
only have  to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a
twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!”
(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper .)
“That would be grand, certainly ,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but
then—I shouldn’ t be hungry for it, you know .”
“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter:  “but you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked.”
“Is that the way you manage?” Alice asked. The Hatter shook his head mournfully .","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"“Not I!” he replied. “We
quarrelled last March—just before he went mad, you know—”
(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the
great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing
‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat! How I wonder what you’re at!’
You know the song, perhaps?”
“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice. “It goes on, you know ,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—
‘Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle—’”
Here the Dormouse  shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
“Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle —” and went on so long that they
had to pinch it to make it stop. “Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter , “when
the Queen  jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time!","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"Off
with his head!’”
“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice. “And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he
won’ t do a thing I ask! It’ s always six o’clock now .”
A bright idea came into Alice’ s head. “Is that the reason so many
tea-things are put out here?” she asked. “Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,
and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”
“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice. “Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”
“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice
ventured to ask. “Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted,
yawning. “I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll

“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal. “Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up,
Dormouse!” And they pinched it on both sides at once. The Dorm ouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’ t asleep,” he said
in a hoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were
saying.”
“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare. “Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice. “And be quick about it,” added the Hatter , “or you’ll be asleep
again before it’ s done.”
“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse
began in a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and
Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well—”
“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great
interest in questions of eating and drinking. “They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a
minute or two. “They couldn’t have done that, you know ,” Alice gently remarked;
“they’d have been ill.”
“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “ very ill.”
Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on:
“But why did they live at the bottom of a well?”
“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very
earnestly . “I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I
can’t take more.”
“You mean you can’t take less,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to
take more than nothing.”
“Nobody asked your opinion,” said Alice. “Who’ s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked
triumphantly . Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself
to some tea and bread-and-butter , and then turned to the Dormouse,
and repea ted her question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a
well?”
The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and
then said, “It was a treacle-well.”
“There’ s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily , but the
Hatter and the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for
yourself.”
“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’ t interrupt
again. I dare say there may be one.”
“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly .","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"However , he
consented to go on. “And so these three little sisters—they were
learning to draw , you know—”6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 34/68“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite for getting her promise. “Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time. “I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one
place on.”
He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the
March Hare moved into the Dormouse’ s place, and Alice rather
unwillingly took the place of the Marc h Hare. The Hatter was the
only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a
good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset
the milk-jug into his plate. Alice did not wish to offend the Dorm ouse again, so she began
very cautiously: “But I don’t understan d. Where did they draw the
treacle from?”
“You can draw water out of a water -well,” said the Hatter; “so I
should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh,
stupid?”
“But they were in the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not
choosing to notice this last remark. “Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”
This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go
on for some time without interrupting it. “They were learning to draw ,” the Dormouse went on, yawning
and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew
all manner of things—everything that begins with an M—”
“Why with an M?” said Alice. “Why not?” said the March Hare. Alice was silent. The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off
into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter , it woke up again
with a little shriek, and went on: “—tha t begins with an M, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory , and muchness—you know
you say things are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a
thing as a drawing of a muchness?”
“Really , now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I
don’t think—”
“Then you shouldn’ t talk,” said the Hatter . This piece  of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up
in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly ,
and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though
she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after
her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the
Dormouse into the teapot. “At any rate I’ll never go there again!” said Alice as she picked
her way through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at
in all my life!”
Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
leading right into it. “That’ s very curious!” she thought.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"

glass table. “Now , I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself,
and began by taking  the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom
(she had kept a piece of it in her pock et) till she was about a foot
high: then she walk ed down the little passage: and then—she found
herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower -beds
and the cool fountains.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 36/68CHAPTER VIII. The Queen’ s Croquet-Ground
A large rose-tree stood near the entranc e of the garden: the roses
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she
went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she
heard one of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’ t go splashing
paint over me like that!”
“I couldn’ t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my
elbow .”
On which  Seven looked up and said, “That’ s right, Five! Always
lay the blame on others!”
“You’d better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”
“What for?” said the one who had spoken first. “That’ s none of your business, Two!” said Seven. “Yes, it is his busin ess!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for
bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”
Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the
unjust things—” when his eye chance d to fall upon Alice, as she
stood watc hing them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others
looked round also, and all of them bowed low . “Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly , “why you are
painting those roses?”
Five and Seven said nothing, but looke d at Two. Two began in a
low voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have
been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the
Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you
know . So you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to
—” At this moment Five, who had been  anxiously looking across the
garden, called out “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners
instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound
of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten soldi ers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like
the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these
came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears
came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all
ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and
Queens, and among them Alice recogni sed the White Rabbit: it was
talking in a hurried nervous manner , smiling at everything that was
said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of
Hearts, carrying the King’ s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and,6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 37/68last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF
HEAR TS. Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on
her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever
having heard of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would
be the use of a procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie
down upon their faces, so that they couldn’ t see it?” So she stood
still where she was, and waited. When the procession  came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and
looked at her, and the Queen said severe ly “Who is this?” She said it
to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply . “Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning
to Alice, she went on, “What’ s your name, child?”
“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty ,” said Alice very
politely; but she added, to herself, “Why , they’re only a pack of
cards, after all. I needn’ t be afraid of them!”
“And who are these? ” said the Queen, pointing to the three
gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they
were lying on their faces, and the pattern  on their backs was the same
as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were
gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children. “How should I know?” said Alice,  surprised at her own courage. “It’s no business of mine .”
The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
moment like a wild beast, screamed “Of f with her head! Of f—”
“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly , and the Queen
was silent. The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider ,
my dear: she is only a child!”
The Quee n turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave
“Turn them over!”
The Knave did so, very carefully , with one foot. “Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the
Queen, the royal children, and everybody else. “Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy .” And
then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What have  you been
doing here?”
“May it please your Majesty ,” said Two, in a very humble tone,
going down on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”
“I see!” said the Quee n, who had meanw hile been examining the
roses. “Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of
the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners,
who ran to Alice for protection. “You shan’ t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a
large flower -pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about
for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off
after the others. “Are their heads of f?” shouted the Queen.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 38/68“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers
shouted in reply . “That’ s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”
The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
evidently meant for her . “Yes!” shouted Alice. “Come on, then!” roared the Queen , and Alice joined the
procession, wondering very much what would happen next. “It’s—it’ s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was
walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her
face. “Very,” said Alice: “—where’ s the Duchess?”
“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself
upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’ s
under sentence of execution.”
“What for?” said Alice. “Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked. “No, I didn’ t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said
‘What for?’”
“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a
little scream of laughter . “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a
frightened tone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather
late, and the Queen said—”
“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder , and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against
each other ; however , they got settled down in a minute or two, and
the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious
croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls
were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers
had to double thems elves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to
make the arches. The chief  difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her
flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away ,
comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but
generally , just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and
was going to give the hedgehog a blow  with its head, it would  twist
itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression
that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got
its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking
to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of
crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow
in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the
doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other
parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a
very dif ficult game indeed. The players all played at once without waiting for turns,
quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a
very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went
stamping about, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her
head!” about once in a minute.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 39/68Alice bega n to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had
any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any
minute, “and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder
is, that there’ s any one left alive!”
She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering
whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a
curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but,
after watc hing it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and
she said to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody
to talk to.”
“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was
mouth enough for it to speak with. Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use
speaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one
of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice
put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling
very glad she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think
that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared. “I don’t think they play at all fairly ,” Alice began, in rather a
complaining tone, “and they all quarrel  so dreadfully one can’t hear
oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular;
at least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea
how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’ s the
arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’ s hedgehog just
now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!”
“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice. “Not at all,” said Alice: “she’ s so extremely—” Just then she
noticed that the Queen was close behin d her, listening: so she went
on, “—likely to win, that it’ s hardly worth while finishing the game.”
The Queen smiled and passed on. “Who are you talkin g to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and
looking at the Cat’ s head with great curiosity . “It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to
introduce it.”
“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however , it may
kiss my hand if it likes.”
“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked. “Don’ t be impertine nt,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like
that!” He got behind Alice as he spoke. “A cat may look at a king,” said Alice . “I’ve read that in some
book, but I don’ t remember where.”
“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly , and he
called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish
you would have this cat removed!”
The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or
small. “Of f with his head!” she said, without even looking round. “I’ll fetch the execu tioner myself,” said the King eagerly , and he
hurried of f.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 40/68Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game
was going on, as she heard the Queen’ s voice in the distance,
screaming with passion. She had alread y heard her sentence three of
the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did
not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion
that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in
search of her hedgehog. The hedge hog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,
which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of
them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was
gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it
trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree. By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the
fight was over, and both the hedgehog s were out of sight: “but it
doesn’ t matter much ,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from
this side of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it
might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation
with her friend. When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find
quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on
between the executioner , the King, and the Queen, who were all
talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very
uncomfortable. The mome nt Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to
settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though,
as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out
exactly what they said. The executioner ’s argument was, that you couldn’ t cut off a head
unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do
such a thing before, and he wasn’ t going to begin at his time of life. The King’ s argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you weren’ t to talk nonsense. The Queen’ s argument was, that if some thing wasn’ t done about it
in less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It
was this last remark  that had made the whole party look so grave and
anxious.)
Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the
Duchess: you’d better ask her about it.”
“She’ s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her
here.” And the executioner went of f like an arrow . The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,
by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely
disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down
looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll

“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old
thing!” said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into
Alice’ s, and they walked of f together . Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper , and
thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made
her so savage when they met in the kitchen. “When I’m a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful
tone thoug h), “I won’ t have any peppe r in my kitchen at all. Soup
does very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes
people hot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having
found out a new kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—
and camomile that makes them bitter— and—and barley-sugar and
such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people
knew that: then they wouldn’ t be so stingy about it, you know—”
She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she heard her voice close  to her ear.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"“You’re thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit.”
“Perhaps it hasn’ t one,” Alice ventured to remark. “Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’ s got a moral, if
only you can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’ s
side as she spoke. Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
Duchess was very ugly; and secondly , because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon Alice’ s shoulder , and it was an
uncomfortably sharp  chin. However , she did not like to be rude, so
she bore it as well as she could. “The game’ s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of
keeping up the conversation a little. “’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis
love, ’ tis love, that makes the world go round!’”
“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody
minding their own business!”
“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess,
digging her sharp little chin into Alice’ s shoulder as she added, “and
the moral of that is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will
take care of themselves.’”
“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to
herself. “I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your
waist,” the Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 42/68doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the
experiment?”
“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious
to have the experiment tried. “Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together .’”
“Only mustard isn’ t a bird,” Alice remarked. “Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of
putting things!”
“It’s a mineral, I think ,” said Alice. “Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
everything that Alice said; “there’ s a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there
is of yours.’”
“Oh, I know!” excla imed Alice, who had not attended to this last
remark, “it’ s a vegetable. It doesn’ t look like one, but it is.”
“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that
is—‘Be what you would seem to be’— or if you’d like it put more
simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it
might appear to others that what you were or might have been was
not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them
to be otherwise.’”
“I think I should understand that better ,” Alice said very politely ,
“if I had it written down: but I can’ t quite follow it as you say it.”
“That’ s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess
replied, in a pleased tone. “Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said
Alice.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a
present of everything I’ve said as yet.”
“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give
birthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out
loud. “Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her
sharp little chin. “I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply , for she was beginning to
feel a little worried. “Just abou t as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly;
and the m—”
But here, to Alice’ s great surprise, the Duchess’ s voice died away ,
even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’  and the arm that
was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there
stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like
a thunderstorm. “A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duch ess began in a low, weak
voice. “Now , I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on
the ground  as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and
that in about half no time! Take your choice!”
The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 43/68“Let’ s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice
was too much fright ened to say a word, but slowly followed her back
to the croquet-ground. The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’ s absence, and
were resting in the shade: however , the moment they saw her, they
hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a
moment’ s delay would cost them their lives. All the time they were playing the Quee n never left off quarrelling
with the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off
with her head!” Those whom she senten ced were taken into custody
by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do
this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left,
and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in
custody and under sentence of execution. Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice,
“Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?”
“No,” said Alice. “I don’ t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”
“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen. “I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice. “Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his
history ,”
As they walked off together , Alice heard the King say in a low
voice, to the company generally , “You are all pardoned.” “Come,
that’s a good thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite
unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered. They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy
thing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock
Turtle, and to hear his history . I must go back and see after some
executions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone
with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,
but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it
as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited. The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the
Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said
the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice. “What is the fun?” said Alice. “Why , she,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy , that: they never
executes nobody , you know . Come on!”
“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went
slowly after it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”
They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the
distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they
came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would
break. She pitied him deeply . “What is his sorrow?” she asked the
Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words
as before, “It’s all his fancy , that: he hasn’ t got no sorrow , you know . Come on!”
So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with
large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 44/68“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know
your history , she do.”
“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit
down, both of you, and don’ t speak a word till I’ve finished.”
So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice
thought to herself, “I don’t see how he can ever finish, if he doesn’ t
begin.” But she waited patiently . “Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a
real Turtle.”
These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by
an occasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh! ” from the Gryphon, and the
constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly
getting up and saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story ,”
but she could not help thinking there must  be more to come, so she
sat still and said nothing. “When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more
calmly , though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school
in the sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him
Tortoise—”
“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’ t one?” Alice asked. “We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock
Turtle angrily: “really you are very dull!”
“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and
looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the
Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Driv e on, old fellow! Don’ t be all
day about it!” and he went on in these words:
“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’ t believe it
—”
“I never said I didn’ t!” interrupted Alice. “You did,” said the Mock Turtle. “Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon , before Alice could speak
again. The Mock Turtle went on. “We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every
day—”
“I’ve been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’ t be so
proud as all that.”
“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously . “Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”
“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle. “Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly . “Ah! then yours wasn’ t a really good school,” said the Mock
Turtle in a tone of great relief. “Now at ours they had at the end of
the bill, ‘French, music, and washing —extra.’”
“You couldn’ t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the
bottom of the sea.”
“I couldn’ t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I
only took the regular course.”
“What was that?” inquired Alice.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 45/68“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle
replied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.”
“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is
it?”
The Gryp hon lifted up both its paws in surprise.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
“What!,"Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"Never
heard of uglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I
suppose?”
“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—
prettier .”
“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to
uglify is, you are a simpleton.”
Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it,
so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to
learn?”
“Well, there was Mystery ,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off
the subjec ts on his flappers, “—Mystery , ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old
conger -eel, that used to come once a week: he taught us Drawling,
Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.”
“What was that like?” said Alice. “Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”
“Hadn’ t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master ,
though. He was an old crab, he was.”
“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he
taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say .”
“So he did, so he did,” said the Grypho n, sighing in his turn; and
both creatures hid their faces in their paws. “And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a
hurry to change the subject. “Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and
so on.”
“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice. “That’ s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:
“because they lessen from day to day .”
This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have
been a holiday?”
“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle. “And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly . “That’ s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very
decided tone: “tell her something about the games now .”6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply , and drew the back of one flapper
across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a
minute or two sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in
his throat, ” said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and
punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his
voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:—
“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’ t,” said
Alice)—“and perhap s you were never even introduced to a lobster
—” (Alice began to say “I once tasted— ” but checked herself hastily ,
and said “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful
thing a Lobster Quadrille is!”
“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”
“Why ,” said the Gryphon, “you first form  into a line along the sea-
shore—”
“Two lines !” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so
on; then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”
“That generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon. “—you advance twice—”
“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon. “Of course ,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners
—”
“—change lobsters, and retire in same order ,” continued the
Gryphon. “Then, you know ,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”
“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air . “—as far out to sea as you can—”
“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon. “Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering
wildly about. “Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its
voice. “Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had
been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again
very sadly and quietly , and looked at Alice. “It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly . “Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle. “Very much indeed,” said Alice. “Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the
Gryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know . Which shall6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 47/68sing?”
“Oh, you sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve for gotten the words.”
So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every
now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and
waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang
this, very slowly and sadly:—
“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail. “There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail. See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance! They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance? Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance? Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance? “You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”
But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the
dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance. “What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied. “There is another shore, you know, upon the other side. The further off from England the nearer is to France—
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance. Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance? Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”
“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,
feeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that
curious song about the whiting!”
“Oh, as to the whitin g,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen
them, of course?”
“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked
herself hastily . “I don’t know wher e Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if
you’ve seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”
“I believe so,” Alice  replied thoughtfully . “They have their tails in
their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”
“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs
would all wash off in the sea. But they have  their tails in their
mouths; and the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut
his eyes.— “Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the
Gryphon. “The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they would  go with the
lobsters to the dance. So they got throw n out to sea. So they had to
fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they
couldn’ t get them out again. That’ s all.”
“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so
much about a whiting before.”
“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do
you know why it’ s called a whiting?”6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 48/68“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”
“It does the boots and shoes ,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly . Alice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she
repeated in a wondering tone. “Why , what are your shoes done with?”  said the Gryphon . “I
mean, what makes them so shiny?”
Alice looked down at them, and conside red a little before she gave
her answer . “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”
“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep
voice, “are done with a whiting. Now you know .”
“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great
curiosity . “Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather
impatiently: “any shrimp could have told you that.”
“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still
running on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,
please: we don’ t want you with us!’”
“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said:
“no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”
“Wouldn’ t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise. “Of course  not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to me,
and told me he was going a journey , I should say ‘With what
porpoise?’”
“Don’ t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice. “I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added “Come, let’ s hear some of your adventures.”
“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,”
said Alice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday ,
because I was a dif ferent person then.”
“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle. “No, no! The adven tures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient
tone: “explanations take such a dreadful time.”
So Alice began telling them her adven tures from the time when
she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just
at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and
opened their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage
as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the
part about her repeating “You are old, Father William ,” to the
Caterpillar , and the words all coming different, and then the Mock
Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’ s very curious.”
“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon. “It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully . “I
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
begin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind
of authority over Alice. “Stand up and repeat ‘’Tis the voice of the sluggar d,’” said the
Gryphon. “How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat
lessons!” thought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.”6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 49/68However , she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full
of the Lobster Quad rille, that she hardly knew what she was saying,
and the words came very queer indeed:—
“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”
As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”
[later editions continued as follows
When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]
“That’ s different from what I used to say when I was a child,” said
the Gryphon. “Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it
sounds uncommon nonsense.”
Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle. “She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily . “Go on with the
next verse.”
“But abou t his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “How could  he
turn them out with his nose, you know?”
“It’s the first positio n in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject. “Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it
begins ‘ I passed by his gar den.’”
Alice did not dare to disobey , though she felt sure it would all
come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—
“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”
[later editions continued as follows
The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat. When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
And concluded the banquet—]
“What is the use of repeating all that stuff,” the Mock Turtle
interrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the most
confusing thing I ever heard!”
“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice
was only too glad to do so. “Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the
Gryphon went on. “Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a
song?”6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 50/68“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
“Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her ‘Turtle Soup ,’ will you, old
fellow?”
The Mock  Turtle sighed deeply , and began, in a voice sometimes
choked with sobs, to sing this:—
“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
Waiting in a hot tureen! Who for such dainties would not stoop? Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup! “Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
Game, or any other dish? Who would not give all else for two p
ennyworth only of beautiful Soup? Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup? Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”
“Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just
begun to repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’ s beginning!” was heard
in the distance. “Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it
hurried of f, without waiting for the end of the song. “What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
answered “Come on!” and ran the faster , while more and more
faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the
melancholy words:—
“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 51/68CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts? The King and Quee n of Hearts were seated on their throne when
they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of
little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave
was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to
guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet
in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other . In the very
middle of the court  was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it:
they looke d so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them
—“I wish  they’d get the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round
the refreshments!” But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she
began looking at everything about her , to pass away the time. Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
about them in books , and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
the name of nearly everything there. “That’ s the judge,” she said to
herself, “because of his great wig.”
The judge , by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown
over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did
it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not
becoming. “And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve
creatures,” (she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because
some of them were animals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they
are the jurors.” She said this last word two or three times over to
herself, being rather  proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that
very few little girls of her age knew  the meaning of it at all. However , “jury-men” would have done just as well. The twelv e jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are
they doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have
anything to put down yet, before the trial’ s begun.”
“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in
reply , “for fear they should for get them before the end of the trial.”
“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she
stopped hastily , for the White Rabbit  cried out, “Silence in the
court!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously
round, to make out who was talking. Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their
shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on
their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn’ t
know how to spell “stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to
tell him. “A nice muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’ s over!”
thought Alice.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 52/68One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him,
and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away . She did it so
quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not
make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for
it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and
this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate. “Herald, read the accusation!” said the King. On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and
then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—
“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
    All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
    And took them quite away!”
“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury . “Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’ s a great
deal to come before that!”
“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew
three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”
The first witness was the Hatter . He came in with a teacup in one
hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other . “I beg pardon, your
Majesty ,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’ t quite finished
my tea when I was sent for .”
“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you
begin?”
The Hatte r looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into
the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormou se. “Fourteenth of March, I
think  it was,” he said. “Fifteenth,” said the March Hare. “Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse. “Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up,
and reduced the answer to shillings and pence. “Take of f your hat,” the King said to the Hatter . “It isn’ t mine,” said the Hatter . “Stolen! ” the King exclaim ed, turning to the jury, who instantly
made a memorandum of the fact. “I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve
none of my own. I’m a hatter .”
Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the
Hatter , who turned pale and fidgeted. “Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll
have you executed on the spot.”
This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
from one foot to the other , looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his
confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-
and-butter . Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which
puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 53/68beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get
up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain
where she was as long as there was room for her . “I wish you wouldn ’t squeeze so.” said the Dormouse, who was
sitting next to her . “I can hardly breathe.”
“I can’ t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”
“You’ve no right to grow here,” said the Dormouse. “Don’ t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re
growing too.”
“Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in
that ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over
to the other side of the court. All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter ,
and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the
officers of the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last
concert!” on which the wretched Hatte r trembled so, that he shook
both his shoes of f. “Give your evidence,” the King repeated  angrily , “or I’ll have you
executed, whether you’re nervous or not.”
“I’m a poor man, your Majesty ,” the Hatter began, in a trembling
voice, “—and I hadn’ t begun my tea—n ot above a week or so—and
what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of
the tea—”
“The twinkling of the what? ” said the King. “It began  with the tea,” the Hatter replied. “Of course  twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply . “Do
you take me for a dunce? Go on!”
“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled
after that—only the March Hare said—”
“I didn’ t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry . “You did!” said the Hatter . “I deny it!” said the March Hare. “He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”
“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on,
looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the
Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep. “After that,” continued the Hatter , “I cut some more bread-and-
butter—”
“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked. “That I can’ t remember ,” said the Hatter . “You must  remember ,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you
executed.”
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter , and
went down on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty ,” he began. “You’re a very poor speaker ,” said the King. Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately
suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word,
I will just explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 54/68bag, which  tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped
the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.)
“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought  Alice. “I’ve so often read
in the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at
applause, which was immediately supp ressed by the officers of the
court,” and I never understood what it meant till now .”
“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued
the King. “I can’ t go no lower ,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor , as it is.”
“Then you may sit down,” the King replied. Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed. “Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we
shall get on better .”
“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter , with an anxious look at
the Queen, who was reading the list of singers. “You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the
court, without even waiting to put his shoes on. “—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of
the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could
get to the door . “Call the next witness!” said the King. The next witness was the Duchess’ s cook. She carried the pepper -
box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got
into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all
at once. “Give your evidence,” said the King.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"“Shan’ t,” said the cook. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low
voice, “Y our Majesty must cross-examine this witness.”
“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air,
and, after folding his arms and frowning  at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made
of?”
“Pepper , mostly ,” said the cook. “Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her .","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead that
Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch
him! Of f with his whiskers!”
For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the
Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again,
the cook had disappeared. “Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"“Call the
next witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really ,
my dear, you must cross-examine  the next witness. It quite makes my
forehead ache!”
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,
feeling very curious  to see what the next witness would be like, “—
for they haven’ t got much evidence yet,” she said to herself. Imagine6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll

“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment
how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up
in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her
skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below ,
and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a
globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay ,
and began  picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the
accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a
vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back
into the jury-box, or they would die. “The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice,
“until all the jurym en are back in their proper places— all,” he
repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so. Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had
put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was
waving its tail abou t in a melancholy way, being quite unable to
move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies
much,” she said to herself; “I should think it would be quite  as much
use in the trial one way up as the other .”
As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back
to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to
do anything but sit with its mouth open , gazing up into the roof of
the court. “What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice. “Nothing,” said Alice. “Nothing whatever? ” persisted the King. “Nothing whatever ,” said Alice. “That’ s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They
were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the
White Rabbit interrupted: “Unimportant, your Majesty means, of
course,” he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making
faces at him as he spoke. “Unimportant, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went
on to himself in an undertone,
“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he
were trying which word sounded best. Some of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some
“unimportant.” Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look
over their slates; “but it doesn’ t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 57/68At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily
writing in his note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from
his book, “Rule Forty-two. All persons more than a mile high to
leave the court .”
Everybody looked at Alice. “I’m not a mile high,” said Alice. “You are,” said the King. “Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen. “Well, I shan’ t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a
regular rule: you invented it just now .”
“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King. “Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice. The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily . “Consider
your verdict,” he said to the jury , in a low , trembling voice. “There’ s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty ,” said
the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just
been picked up.”
“What’ s in it?” said the Queen. “I haven’ t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to
be a letter , written by the prisoner to—to somebody .”
“It must have been that,” said the King , “unless it was written to
nobody , which isn’ t usual, you know .”
“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen. “It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’ s
nothing written on the outside .” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,
and added “It isn’ t a letter , after all: it’ s a set of verses.”
“Are they in the prisoner ’s handwriting?” asked another of the
jurymen. “No, they’ re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest
thing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)
“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.)
“Please your Majest y,” said the Knave, “I didn’ t write it, and they
can’t prove I did: there’ s no name signed at the end.”
“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter
worse. You must  have meant some mischief, or else you’d have
signed your name like an honest man.”
There was a general clapping of hand s at this: it was the first
really clever thing the King had said that day . “That proves his guilt,” said the Queen. “It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice. “Why , you don’t even
know what they’re about!”
“Read them,” said the King. The White  Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin,
please your Majesty?” he asked. “Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely , “and go on till
you come to the end: then stop.”
These were the verses the White Rabbit read:—6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 58/68“They told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim. He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before. If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were. My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it. Don’t let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.”
“That’ s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,”
said the King, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”
“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so
large in the last few minutes that she wasn’ t a bit afraid of
interrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpen ce. I don’t believe there’ s an
atom of meaning in it.”
The jury all wrote down on their slates, “She doesn’ t believe
there’ s an atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to
explain the paper . “If there’ s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of
trouble, you know , as we needn’ t try to find any.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"And yet I don’t
know ,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking
at them with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. “—said I could not swim—” you can’t swim , can you?” he added,
turning to the Knave. The Knav e shook his head sadly .","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"“Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.)
“All right,  so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over
the verses to himsel f: “‘We know it to be true—’ that’s the jury, of
course—‘ I gave her one, they gave him two—’ why, that must be
what he did with the tarts, you know—”
“But, it goes on ‘ they all r eturned fr om him to you ,’” said Alice. “Why , there they are!” said the King triumphantly , pointing to the
tarts on the table.","Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.pdf"
"“Nothing can be clearer than that. Then again6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 59/68—‘befor e she had this fit—’ you never had fits, my dear, I think?” he
said to the Queen. “Never!” said the Queen furiously , throwing an inkstand at the
Lizard as she spoke . (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing
on his slate with one finger , as he found it made no mark; but he now
hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face,
as long as it lasted.)
“Then the words don’t fit you,” said the King , looking round the
court with a smile. There was a dead silence. “It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody
laughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for
about the twentieth time that day . “No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”
“Stuf f and nonsense!” said Alice loudly . “The idea of having the
sentence first!”
“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple. “I won’ t!” said Alice. “Off with her head!” the Queen shoute d at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. “Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size
by this time.) “Y ou’re nothing but a pack of cards!”
At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down
upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger ,
and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with
her head in the lap of her sister , who was gently brushing away some
dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. “Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why , what a long sleep
you’ve had!”
“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her
sister , as well as she could rememb er them, all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when
she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It was a curious
dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”
So Alice got up and ran off, thinking  while she ran, as well she
might, what a wonderful dream it had been. But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
hand, watc hing the setting sun, and think ing of little Alice and all her
wonderful Adventur es, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,
and this was her dream:—
First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were
looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and
see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair
that would  always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or
seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the
strange creatures of her little sister ’s dream.6/26/24, 2:12 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11-images.html 60/68The long grass rustle d at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—
the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring
pool—she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and
his friends shared their never -ending meal, and the shrill voice of the
Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more
the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess’ s knee, while plates and
dishes crashed around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the
squeaking of the Lizard’ s slate-pencil, and the choking of the
suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs
of the miserable Mock Turtle. So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though  she knew she had but to open them again, and
all would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in
the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the
rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the
Queen’ s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze
of the baby , the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises,
would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-
yard—while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the
place of the Mock Turtle’ s heavy sobs. Lastly , she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she
would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart
of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little
children, and make their  eyes bright and eager with many a strange
tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and
how she would feel with all their simple  sorrows, and find a pleasure
in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the
happy summer days. THE END

JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL
(Kept in shorthand. )
3 May.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Bistritz. —Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving
at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train
was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the
glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk
through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had
arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The
impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the
East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is
here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of
Turkish rule. We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to
Klausenbur gh. Here  I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had
for dinner , or rather  supper , a chicken done up some way with red
pepper , which was very good but thirsty.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"(Mem. , get recipe for
Mina.) I asked the waiter , and he said it was called “paprika hendl,”
and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere
along the Carpathians. I found my smat tering of German very useful
here; indeed, I don’ t know how I should be able to get on without it. Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had
visited the British Museum, and made search among the books and
maps in the library  regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that
some foreknowledg e of the country could hardly fail to have some
importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country . I find that the
district he named is in the extreme east of the country , just on the
borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the
midst of the Carpa thian mountains; one of the wildest and least
known portions of Europe. I was not able to light on any map or
work givin g the exact locality of the Castle Dracula, as there are no
maps of this country as yet to compa re with our own Ordnance
Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post town named by
Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some
of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my
travels with Mina. In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct
nationalities: Saxon s in the South, and mixed with them the
Wallachs, who are the descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the
West, and Szekelys in the East and North. I am going among the
latter , who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns. This may
be so, for when the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh
century they found the Huns settled in it. I read that every known
superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the
Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative
whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (Mem. , I must ask
the Count all about them.)6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 7/291I did not sleep well,  though my bed was comfortable enough, for I
had all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night
under my window , which may have had something to do with it; or it
may have been the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my
carafe, and was still thirsty . Towards  morning I slept and was
wakened by the continuous knocking at my door, so I guess I must
have been sleeping soundly then. I had for breakfast more paprika,
and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was
“mamaliga,” and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent
dish, which they call “impletata.” (Mem. , get recipe for this also.) I
had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little before eight, or
rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 7:30
I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to
move. It seems to me that the further east you go the more
unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China? All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was
full of beauty of every kind. Sometim es we saw little towns or
castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals;
sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the
wide stony margin on each side of them  to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water , and running strong, to sweep the outside edge
of a river clear . At every station there were groups of people,
sometimes crowds, and in all sorts of attire. Some of them were just
like the peasants at home or those I saw coming through France and
Germany , with short jackets and round hats and home-made trousers;
but others were very picturesque. The women looked pretty , except
when you got near them, but they were very clumsy about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other , and most of
them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from
them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petticoats
under them. The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who
were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, great
baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy
leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and had
long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very
picturesque, but do not look prepossess ing. On the stage they would
be set down at once as some old Orienta l band of brigands. They are,
however , I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-
assertion. It was on the dark side of twilight when  we got to Bistritz, which
is a very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier—for
the Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina—it has had a very
stormy existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a
series of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five
separate occasions. At the very beginnin g of the seventeenth century
it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the
casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease. Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel,
which I found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned,
for of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country . I
was evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a
cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress—white6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 8/291under garment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured
stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty . When I came close she
bowed and said, “The Herr Englishma n?” “Yes,” I said, “Jonathan
Harker .” She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in
white shirt-sleeves, who had followed her to the door. He went, but
immediately returned with a letter:—
“My Friend.—W elcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously
expecting you.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence
will start for Bukov ina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo
Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust that
your journ ey from London has been a happy one, and that you will
enjoy your stay in my beautiful land. “Your friend,
“D       .”
4 May.—I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,
directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on
making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and
pretended that he could not understand  my German. This could not
be true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he
answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old
lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort
of way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter , and
that was all he knew . When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula,
and could tell me anything of his castle,  both he and his wife crossed
themselves, and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused
to speak further . It was so near the time of starting that I had no time
to ask any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any
means comforting. Just befor e I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and
said in a very hysterical way:
“Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?” She was in such an
excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German
she knew , and mixed it all up with some other language which I did
not know at all. I was just able to follow her by asking many
questions. When I told her that I must go at once, and that I was
engaged on important business, she asked again:
“Do you know what day it is?” I answered that it was the fourth of
May. She shook her head as she said again:
“Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it
is?” On my saying that I did not understand, she went on:
“It is the eve of St. Geor ge’s Day. Do you not know that to-night,
when the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will
have full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are
going to?” She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort
her, but without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and
implored me not to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It
was all very ridiculo us but I did not feel comfortable. However , there
was business to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with
it. I therefore tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could,
that I thanked her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck
offered it to me. I did not know what to do, for, as an English6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 9/291Churchman, I have been taught to regard such things as in some
measure idolatrous, and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old
lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind. She saw, I
suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the rosary round my neck,
and said, “For your mother ’s sake,” and went out of the room. I am
writing up this part of the diary whilst  I am waiting for the coach,
which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still round my neck. Whether it is the old lady’ s fear, or the many ghostly traditions of
this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know , but I am not feeling
nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should ever reach
Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the coach! 5 May.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"The Castle. —The grey of the morning has passed, and the
sun is high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether
with trees or hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and
little are mixed. I am not sleepy , and, as I am not to be called till I
awake, naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things
to put down, and, lest who reads them  may fancy that I dined too
well before I left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly . I dined
on what they called  “robber steak”—bits of bacon, onion, and beef,
seasoned with red pepper , and strung on sticks and roasted over the
fire, in the simple style of the London cat’s meat! The wine was
Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the tongue,
which is, however , not disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of
this, and nothing else.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I
saw him talking with the landlady . They were evidently talking of
me, for every now and then they looked at me, and some of the
people who were sitting on the bench outside the door—which they
call by a name mean ing “word-bearer”— came and listened, and then
looked at me, most  of them pityingly . I could hear a lot of words
often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the
crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and
looked them out. I must say they were not cheering to me, for
amongst them were “Ordog”—Satan, “pokol”—hell, “stregoica”—
witch, “vrolok” and “vlkoslak”—both of which mean the same thing,
one being  Slovak and the other Servian  for something that is either
were-wolf or vampire. (Mem. , I must ask the Count about these
superstitions)
When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this
time swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and
pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a fellow-
passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at first,
but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a charm
or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me, just
starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every
one seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic
that I could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse
which I had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all
crossing themselves , as they stood round the wide archway , with its
background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs
clustered in the centre of the yard. Then our driver , whose wide linen
drawers covered the whole front of the box-seat—“gotza” they call6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 10/291them—cracked his big whip over his four small horses, which ran
abreast, and we set of f on our journey . I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of
the scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or
rather languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I
might not have been able to throw them  off so easily . Before us lay a
green sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there
steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the
blank gable end to the road. There was everywhere a bewildering
mass of fruit blosso m—apple, plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove
by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the
fallen petals. In and out amongst these green hills of what they call
here the “Mittel Land” ran the road, losing itself as it swept round
the grassy  curve, or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine
woods, which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of
flame. The road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a
feverish haste. I could not understand then what the haste meant, but
the driver was evidently bent on losing  no time in reaching Borgo
Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime excellent, but that it
had not yet been put in order after the winter snows. In this respect it
is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians, for it is
an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order . Of old
the Hospa dars would not repair them, lest the Turk should think that
they were preparing  to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war
which was always really at loading point. Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty
slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full
upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful
range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and
brown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of
jagged rock and pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the
distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly . Here and there
seemed mighty rifts in the mountains,  through which, as the sun
began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam of falling
water . One of my companions touched  my arm as we swept round
the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered peak of a
mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to be
right before us:—
“Look! Isten szek!”—“God’ s seat!”—and he crossed himself
reverently . As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and
lower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round
us. This was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top
still held the sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool
pink. Here and there we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in
picturesque attire, but I noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses, and as we swept by, my
companions all crossed themselves. Here and there was a peasant
man or woman knee ling before a shrine,  who did not even turn round
as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion to
have neith er eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were many
things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 11/291there very beautiful masses of weepi ng birch, their white stems
shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and
again we passed a leiter -wagon—the ordinary peasant’ s cart—with
its long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the
road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming
peasants, the Cszeks with their white,  and the Slovaks with their
coloured, sheepskin s, the latter carryi ng lance-fashion their long
staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,
and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness
the gloom  of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys
which ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended
through the Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the
background of late-lying snow . Sometimes, as the road was cut
through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing
down upon us, great masses of greyness, which here and there
bestrewed the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect,
which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in
the evenin g, when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the
ghost-like clouds which amongst the Carpathians seem to wind
ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the hills were so steep
that, despite our driver’s haste, the horses could only go slowly . I
wished to get down and walk up them , as we do at home, but the
driver would not hear of it. “No, no,” he said; “you must not walk
here; the dogs are too fierce”; and then he added, with what he
evidently meant for grim pleasantry—f or he looked round to catch
the approving smile of the rest—“and you may have enough of such
matters before you go to sleep.” The only stop he would make was a
moment’ s pause to light his lamps. When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst
the passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other , as
though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses
unmercifully with his long whip, and with wild cries of
encouragement urged them on to further exertions. Then through the
darkness I could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us, as
though there were a cleft in the hills. The excitement of the
passengers grew greater; the crazy coach rocked on its great leather
springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea. I had to hold
on.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"The road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along. Then
the mount ains seem ed to come nearer  to us on each side and to
frown down upon us; we were entering  on the Borgo Pass. One by
one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed
upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were
certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple
good faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange
mixture of fear-mea ning movements which I had seen outside the
hotel at Bistritz—th e sign of the cross and the guard against the evil
eye. Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each
side the passengers , craning over the edge of the coach, peered
eagerly into the darkness. It was evident that something very exciting
was either happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger ,
no one would give me the slightest explanation. This state of
excitement kept on for some little time; and at last we saw before us
the Pass opening out on the eastern side. There were dark, rolling
clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy , oppressive sense of6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 12/291thunder . It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two
atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous one. I was
now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to
the Count. Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through
the blackness; but all was dark. The only light was the flickering rays
of our own lamps, in which the steam from our hard-driven horses
rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy road lying white
before us, but there  was on it no sign of a vehicle. The passengers
drew back  with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock my own
disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when the
driver , looking at his watch, said to the others something which I
could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I
thought it was “An hour less than the time.” Then turning to me, he
said in German worse than my own:—
“There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He
will now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next
day; better the next day.” Whilst he was speaking the horses began to
neigh and snort and plunge wildly , so that the driver had to hold
them up. Then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a
universal crossing of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove
up behind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see
from the flash of our lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses
were coal-black and splendid animals. They were driven by a tall
man, with a long brown beard and a great black hat, which seemed to
hide his face from us. I could only see the gleam of a pair of very
bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:—
“You are early to-ni ght, my friend.” The man stammered in reply:
—
“The Engl ish Herr was in a hurry ,” to which the stranger replied:
—
“That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses
are swift.” As he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-
looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white
as ivory . One of my companions whispered to another the line from
Burger’s “Lenore”:—
“Denn die Todten reiten schnell”—
(“For the dead travel fast.”)
The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a
gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away , at the same
time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. “Give me the
Herr’s luggage,” said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags
were hand ed out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the
side of the coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver
helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his
strength must have been prodigious. Without a word he shook his
reins, the horses turned, and we swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looke d back I saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the
light of the lamps, and projected again st it the figures of my late
companions crossing themselves. Then the driver cracked his whip
and called to his horses, and off they swept on their way to6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 13/291Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a strange chill, and a
lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown over my
shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in excellent
German:—
“The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me
take all care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of
the country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.” I did not
take any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt
a little strangely , and not a little frightened. I think had there been
any altern ative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that
unknown night journey . The carriage went at a hard pace straight
along, then we made  a complete turn and went along another straight
road. It seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the
same ground again;  and so I took note of some salient point, and
found that this was so. I would have liked to have asked the driver
what this all meant, but I really feared  to do so, for I thought that,
placed as I was, any protest would have had no effect in case there
had been an intention to delay . By-and-by , however , as I was curious
to know how time was passing, I struck a match, and by its flame
looked at my watch; it was within a few minutes of midnight. This
gave me a sort of shock, for I suppose the general superstition about
midnight was increased by my recent experiences. I waited with a
sick feeling of suspense. Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the
road—a long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken
up by another dog, and then another and another , till, borne on the
wind which now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling
began, which seemed to come from all over the country , as far as the
imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night. At the first
howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them
soothingly , and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as
though after a runaway from sudden fright. Then, far off in the
distance, from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a
sharper howling—that of wolves—whi ch affected both the horses
and mysel f in the same way—for I was minded to jump from the
calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly , so that
the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting. In a few minutes, however , my own ears got accustomed to the
sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to
descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and
whispered somethin g in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers
doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they
became quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The
driver again took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great
pace. This time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly
turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right. Soon we were hemm ed in with trees, which in places arched right
over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great
frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in
shelter , we could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled
through the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as
we swept along. It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery
snow bega n to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 14/291with a white blanket. The keen wind still carried the howling of the
dogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way. The baying of
the wolves sounded nearer and nearer , as though they were closing
round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses
shared my fear. The driver , however , was not in the least disturbed;
he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything
through the darkness. Suddenly , away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The driver  saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses,
and, jump ing to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not
know what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer;
but while  I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and
without a word took his seat, and we resumed our journey . I think I
must have  fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it
seemed to be repeated endlessly , and now looking back, it is like a
sort of awful nightmare. Once the flame appeared so near the road,
that even in the darkness around us I could watch the driver ’s
motions. He went rapidly to where the blue flame arose—it must
have been very faint, for it did not seem to illumine the place around
it at all—and gather ing a few stones, formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical effect: when he stood between
me and the flame he did not obstruct it, for I could see its ghostly
flicker all the same. This startled me, but as the effect was only
momentary , I took it that my eyes decei ved me straining through the
darkness. Then for a time there were no blue flames, and we sped
onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around
us, as though they were following in a moving circle. At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than
he had yet gone, and during his absence , the horses began to tremble
worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see
any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether;
but just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared
behind the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light
I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red
tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a
hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than
even when  they howled. For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors
that he can understand their true import. All at once  the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had
had some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and
reared, and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way
painful to see; but the living ring of terror encompassed them on
every side; and they had perforce to remain within it. I called to the
coachman to come, for it seemed to me that our only chance was to
try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach. I shouted
and beat the side of the calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the
wolves from that side, so as to give him a chance of reaching the
trap. How he came there, I know not, but I heard his voice raised in a
tone of imperious command, and looking towards the sound, saw
him stand  in the roadway . As he swept his long arms, as though
brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves fell back and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 15/291back furth er still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of
the moon, so that we were again in darkness. When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche,
and the wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny
that a dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or
move. The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now
in almost complete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the
moon. We kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick
descent, but in the main always ascending. Suddenly , I became
conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the
horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black
windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements
showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL—continued
5 May.—I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully
awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as
several dark ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps
seemed bigger than it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by
daylight. When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out
his hand to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his
prodigious strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that
could have crushed  mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my
traps, and placed them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a
great door, old and studded with large iron nails, and set in a
projecting doorway of massive stone. I could see even in the dim
light that the stone was massively carved, but that the carving had
been much  worn by time and weather . As I stood, the driver jumped
again into his seat and shook the reins ; the horses started forward,
and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark openings. I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of
bell or knocker there was no sign; throu gh these frowning walls and
dark window openings it was not likely that my voice could
penetrate. The time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and
fears crow ding upon me. What sort of place had I come to, and
among what kind of people? What sort of grim adventure was it on
which I had embark ed? Was this a customary incident in the life of a
solicitor ’s clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a London estate
to a foreigner? Solic itor’s clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor
—for just before leaving London I got word that my examination
was successful; and I am now a full-blown solicitor! I began to rub
my eyes and pinch myself to see if I were awake. It all seemed like a
horrible nightmare to me, and I expe cted that I should suddenly
awake, and find myself at home, with the dawn struggling in through
the windows, as I had now and again felt in the morning after a day
of overwork. But my flesh answered the pinching test, and my eyes
were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake and among the
Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to wait the
coming of the morning. Just as I had come to this conclusio n I heard a heavy step
approaching behind  the great door, and saw through the chinks the
gleam of a coming light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains
and the clanking of massive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with
the loud grating noise of long disuse, and the great door swung back. Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white
moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single
speck of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique
silver lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 17/291any kind, throwing  long quivering shadows as it flickered in the
draught of the open door. The old man motioned me in with his right
hand with a courtly  gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a
strange intonation:—
“Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!” He
made no motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as
though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant,
however , that I had stepped over the threshold, he moved
impulsively forward, and holding out his hand grasped mine with a
strength which made me wince, an effect which was not lessened by
the fact that it seemed as cold as ice—more like the hand of a dead
than a living man. Again he said:—
“Welcome to my house.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Come freely. Go safely; and leave
something of the happiness you bring!” The strength of the
handshake was so much akin to that which I had noticed in the
driver , whose face I had not seen, that for a moment I doubted if it
were not the same person to whom I was speaking; so to make sure, I
said interrogatively:—
“Count Dracula?” He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:—
“I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome,  Mr. Harker , to my house. Come in; the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.” As
he was speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and
stepping out, took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could
forestall him. I protested but he insisted:—
“Nay , sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not
available. Let me see to your comfort myself.” He insisted on
carrying my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding
stair, and along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps
rang heav ily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I
rejoiced to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for
supper , and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly
replenished, flamed and flared. The Coun t halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and
crossing the room, opened another door, which led into a small
octagonal room lit by a single lamp , and seemingly without a
window of any sort. Passing through this, he opened another door,
and motioned me to enter . It was a welcome sight; for here was a
great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log fire,—also
added to but lately , for the top logs were fresh—which sent a hollow
roar up the wide chimney . The Count himself left my luggage inside
and withdrew , saying, before he closed the door:—
“You will need, after your journey , to refresh yourself by making
your toilet . I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready ,
come into the other room, where you will find your supper
prepared.”
The light and warmt h and the Count’ s courteous welcome seemed
to have dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my
normal state, I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so
making a hasty toilet, I went into the other room. I found supper alrea dy laid out. My host, who stood on one side of
the great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful
wave of his hand to the table, and said:—6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 18/291“I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust,
excuse me that I do not join you; but I have dined already , and I do
not sup.”
I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted
to me. He opened it and read it gravely;  then, with a charming smile,
he handed it to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a
thrill of pleasure. “I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a
constant sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for
some time to come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient
substitute, one in whom I have every possible confidence. He is a
young man, full of energy and talent in his own way, and of a very
faithful disposition. He is discreet and silent, and has grown into
manhood in my service. He shall be ready to attend on you when you
will during his stay , and shall take your instructions in all matters.”
The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish,
and I fell to at once  on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some
cheese and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay , of which I had two
glasses, was my supper . During the time I was eating it the Count
asked me many questions as to my journey , and I told him by
degrees all I had experienced. By this time I had finished my supper , and by my host’ s desire had
drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he
offered me, at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very
marked physiognomy . His face was a strong—a very strong—aquiline, with high bridge
of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed
forehead, and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely
elsewhere. His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over
the nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own
profusion. The mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy
moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp
white teeth; these protruded over the lips, whose remarkable
ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years. For the
rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed; the chin
was broad and stron g, and the cheeks firm though thin. The general
effect was one of extraordinary pallor . Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his
knees in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but
seeing them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were
rather coarse—broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were
hairs in the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut
to a sharp point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched
me, I could not repress a shudder . It may have been that his breath
was rank, but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do
what I would, I could not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it,
drew back ; and with a grim sort of smile, which showed more than
he had yet done his protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his
own side of the fireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I
looked towards the window I saw the first dim streak of the coming
dawn. There seemed a strange stillness over everything; but as I6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 19/291listened I heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of
many wolves. The Count’ s eyes gleamed, and he said:—
“Listen to them—the children of the night. What music they
make!” Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to
him, he added:—
“Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of
the hunter .” Then he rose and said:—
“But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready , and to-morrow
you shall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the
afternoon; so sleep well and dream well!” With a courteous bow, he
opened for me himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered
my bedroom.... I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,
which I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for
the sake of those dear to me! 7 May.—It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed
the last twenty-four  hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of
my own accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room
where we had supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with
coffee kept hot by the pot being placed  on the hearth. There was a
card on the table, on which was written:—
“I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.—D.” I set to
and enjoye d a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so
that I might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find
one. There are certa inly odd deficiencies in the house, considering
the extraor dinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table
service is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of
immense value. The curtains and uphol stery of the chairs and sofas
and the hangings of my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful
fabrics, and must have been of fabulous value when they were made,
for they are centuries old, though in excellent order . I saw something
like them in Hampt on Court, but there they were worn and frayed
and moth-eaten. But still in none of the rooms is there a mirror . There is not even a toilet glass on my table, and I had to get the little
shaving glass from my bag before I could either shave or brush my
hair. I have not yet seen a servant anywhere, or heard a sound near
the castle except the howling of wolves. Some time after I had
finished my meal—I do not know whether to call it breakfast or
dinner , for it was between five and six o’clock when I had it—I
looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about the
castle until I had asked the Count’ s perm ission. There was absolutely
nothing in the room,  book, newspaper , or even writing materials; so I
opened another door in the room and found a sort of library . The
door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked. In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of
English books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of
magazines and newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with
English magazines and newspapers, though none of them were of
very recen t date. The books were of the most varied kind—history ,
geography , politics, political economy , botany , geology , law—all
relating to England and English life and customs and manners. There6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 20/291were even such books of reference as the London Directory , the
“Red” and “Blue” books, Whitaker ’s Almanac, the Army and Navy
Lists, and—it somehow gladdened my heart to see it—the Law List. Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count
entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a
good night’ s rest. Then he went on:—
“I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is
much that will interest you. These companions”—and he laid his
hand on some of the books—“have been good friends to me, and for
some years past, ever since I had the idea of going to London, have
given me many , many hours of pleasure . Through them I have come
to know your great England; and to know her is to love her. I long to
go through the crow ded streets of your mighty London, to be in the
midst of the whirl and rush of humanity , to share its life, its change,
its death, and all that makes it what it is. But alas!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"as yet I only know
your tongu e through books. To you, my friend, I look that I know it
to speak.”
“But, Count,” I said, “you know and speak English thoroughly!”
He bowed gravely . “I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet
I fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I
know the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak
them.”
“Indeed,” I said, “you speak excellently .”
“Not so,” he answered. “Well, I know that, did I move and speak
in your London, none there are who would not know me for a
stranger . That is not enough for me. Here I am noble; I am boyar ; the
common people know me, and I am master . But a stranger in a
strange land, he is no one; men know him not—and to know not is to
care not for. I am content if I am like the rest, so that no man stops if
he see me, or pause in his speaking if he hear my words, ‘Ha, ha! a
stranger!’  I have been so long master that I would be master still—or
at least that none other should be maste r of me. You come to me not
alone as agent of my friend Peter Hawk ins, of Exeter , to tell me all
about my new estate  in London. You shall, I trust, rest here with me
awhile, so that by our talking I may learn the English intonation; and
I would that you tell me when I make error, even of the smallest, in
my speaki ng. I am sorry that I had to be away so long to-day; but
you will, I know , forgive one who has so many important affairs in
hand.”
Of course  I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I
might come into that room when I chose. He answered: “Yes,
certainly ,” and added:—
“You may go anyw here you wish in the castle, except where the
doors are locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is
reason that all thing s are as they are, and did you see with my eyes
and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better
understand.” I said I was sure of this, and then he went on:—
“We are in Transyl vania; and Transylvania is not England. Our
ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange
things. Nay, from what you have told me of your experiences
already , you know something of what strange things there may be.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 21/291This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he
wanted to talk, if only for talking’ s sake, I asked him many questions
regarding things that had already happen ed to me or come within my
notice. Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the
conversation by pretending not to understand; but generally he
answered all I asked most frankly . Then as time went on, and I had
got somewhat bolder , I asked him of some of the strange things of
the preceding night, as, for instance, why the coachman went to the
places where he had seen the blue flames. He then explained to me
that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the year—
last night, in fact, when all evil spirits are supposed to have
unchecked sway—a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure
has been concealed. “That treasure has been hidden,” he went on, “in
the region through which you came last night, there can be but little
doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the
Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why , there is hardly a foot of
soil in all this region  that has not been enriched by the blood of men,
patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the
Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went
out to meet them—men and women, the aged and the children too—
and waited their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they
might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader was triumphant he found but little, for whatever
there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil.”
“But how,” said I, “can it have remained so long undiscovered,
when there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to
look?” The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the
long, sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:—
“Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those
flames only appear on one night; and on that night no man of this
land will, if he can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even
if he did he would not know what to do. Why , even the peasant that
you tell me of who marked the place of the flame would not know
where to look in daylight even for his own work. Even you would
not, I dare be sworn, be able to find these places again?”
“There you are right,” I said. “I know no more than the dead
where even to look for them.” Then we drifted into other matters. “Come,” he said at last, “tell me of London and of the house
which you have procured for me.” With an apology for my
remissness, I went into my own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in order I heard a rattling of china and
silver in the next room, and as I passed through, noticed that the
table had been cleared and the lamp lit, for it was by this time deep
into the dark. The lamps were also lit in the study or library , and I
found the Count lying on the sofa, readi ng, of all things in the world,
an English Bradshaw’ s Guide. When I came in he cleared the books
and papers  from the table; and with him I went into plans and deeds
and figures of all sorts. He was interes ted in everything, and asked
me a myriad quest ions about the place and its surroundings. He
clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the subject of the
neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much more
than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:—6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 22/291“Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go
there I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan—nay ,
pardon me, I fall into my country’ s habit of putting your patronymic
first—my friend Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct
and aid me. He will be in Exeter , miles away , probably working at
papers of the law with my other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!”
We went thoroughly  into the business of the purchase of the estate
at Purfleet . When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the
necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to
Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable
a place. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and
which I inscribe here:—
“At Purfle et, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as
seemed to be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice
that the place was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient
structure, built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large
number of years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all
eaten with rust. “The estate is calle d Carfax, no doub t a corruption of the old
Quatr e Face , as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal
points of the comp ass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite
surrounded by the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many
trees on it, which make it in places gloomy , and there is a deep, dark-
looking pond or small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the
water is clear and flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is
very large and of all periods back, I should say, to mediæval times,
for one part is of stone immensely thick, with only a few windows
high up and heavily barred with iron. It looks like part of a keep, and
is close to an old chapel or church. I could not enter it, as I had not
the key of the door leading to it from the house, but I have taken with
my kodak views of it from various points. The house has been added
to, but in a very straggling way, and I can only guess at the amount
of ground  it covers, which must be very great. There are but few
houses close at hand, one being a very large house only recently
added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum. It is not, however ,
visible from the grounds.”
When I had finished, he said:—
“I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family , and
to live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made
habitable in a day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a
century . I rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times. We
Transylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may lie
amongst the commo n dead. I seek not gaiety nor mirth, not the bright
voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which please
the young  and gay. I am no longer young; and my heart, through
weary years of mourning over the dead, is not attuned to mirth. Moreover , the walls of my castle are broken; the shadows are many ,
and the wind breathes cold through the broken battlements and
casements. I love the shade and the shadow , and would be alone with
my thoughts when I may.” Somehow his words and his look did not
seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his smile
look malignant and saturnine.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 23/291Presently , with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my
papers together . He was some little time away , and I began to look at
some of the books around me. One was an atlas, which I found
opened naturally at England, as if that map had been much used. On
looking at it I found in certain places little rings marked, and on
examining these I noticed that one was near London on the east side,
manifestly where his new estate was situated; the other two were
Exeter , and Whitby on the Yorkshire coast. It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"“Aha!”
he said; “still at your books? Good!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"But you must not work always. Come; I am informed that your supper  is ready .” He took my arm,
and we went into the next room, where  I found an excellent supper
ready on the table. The Count again excused himself, as he had dined
out on his being away from home. But he sat as on the previous
night, and chatted whilst I ate. After supper I smoked, as on the last
evening, and the Count stayed with me, chatting and asking
questions on every conceivable subject, hour after hour. I felt that it
was gettin g very late indeed, but I did not say anything, for I felt
under obligation to meet my host’ s wishes in every way. I was not
sleepy , as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me; but I could not
help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of
the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide. They say that
people who are near death die generally at the change to the dawn or
at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and tied as it
were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere can well
believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up with
preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count Dracula,
jumping to his feet, said:—
“Why , there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay
up so long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear
new country of Engl and less interesting, so that I may not forget how
time flies by us,” and, with a courtly bow , he quickly left me. I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was
little to notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see
was the warm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again,
and have written of this day . 8 May.—I began  to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting
too diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first,
for there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I
cannot but feel uneasy . I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had never
come. It may be that this strange night-e xistence is telling on me; but
would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I could bear
it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with, and he!—
I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let me be
prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and
imagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Let me
say at once how I stand—or seem to. I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I
could not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the
window , and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on
my shoulder , and heard the Count’ s voice saying to me, “Good-
morning.” I started, for it amazed me that I had not seen him, since6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 24/291the reflect ion of the glass covered the whole room behind me. In
starting I had cut myself slightly , but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count’ s salutation,  I turned to the glass again to
see how I had been mistaken. This time there could be no error , for
the man was close to me, and I could see him over my shoulder . But
there was no reflection of him in the mirror! The whole room behind
me was displayed; but there was no sign of a man in it, except
myself. This was startling, and, coming on the top of so many
strange things, was beginning to increase that vague feeling of
uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at the
instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was trickling
over my chin. I laid down the razor , turning as I did so half round to
look for some stick ing plaster . When the Count saw my face, his
eyes blaze d with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a
grab at my throat. I drew away , and his hand touched the string of
beads which held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for
the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever
there. “Take care,” he said, “take care how you cut yourself. It is more
dangerous than you think in this country .” Then seizing the shaving
glass, he went on: “And this is the wretched thing that has done the
mischief. It is a foul bauble of man’ s vanity . Away with it!” and
opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he
flung out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on
the stones of the courtyard far below . Then he withdrew without a
word. It is very annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless
in my watch-case or the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is
fortunately of metal. When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I
could not find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is
strange that as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be
a very peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the
castle. I went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the
South. The view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was
every opportunity of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a
terrible precipice. A stone falling from the window would fall a
thousand feet without touching anything ! As far as the eye can reach
is a sea of green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there
is a chasm. Here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in
deep gor ges through the forests. But I am not in heart to describe beauty , for when I had seen the
view I explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all
locked and bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle
walls is there an available exit. The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL—continued
WHEN I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over
me. I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering
out of every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of
my helple ssness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back
after a few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I
behaved much as a rat does in a trap. When, however , the conviction
had come to me that I was helpless I sat down quietly—as quietly as
I have ever done anything in my life—and began to think over what
was best to be done. I am thinking still, and as yet have come to no
definite conclusion. Of one thing only am I certain; that it is no use
making my ideas known to the Count. He knows well that I am
imprisoned; and as he has done it himself, and has doubtless his own
motives for it, he would only deceive me if I trusted him fully with
the facts. So far as I can see, my only plan will be to keep my
knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes open. I am, I know ,
either being deceived, like a baby , by my own fears, or else I am in
desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and shall need, all my
brains to get through. I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door
below shut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come
at once into the library , so I went cautiously to my own room and
found him making the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I
had all along thoug ht—that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door
laying the table in the dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does
himself all these menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one
else to do them. This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in
the castle, it must have been the Count himself who was the driver of
the coach that brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so,
what does it mean that he could contr ol the wolves, as he did, by
only holdi ng up his hand in silence. How  was it that all the people at
Bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant
the giving of the crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the
mountain ash? Bless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix
round my neck! for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I
touch it. It is odd that a thing which I have been taught to regard with
disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble
be of help. Is it that there is something  in the essence of the thing
itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories
of sympathy and comfort? Some time, if it may be, I must examine
this matter and try to make up my mind about it. In the meantime I
must find out all I can about Count Dracula, as it may help me to
understand. To-nig ht he may talk of himself, if I turn the
conversation that way. I must be very careful, however , not to awake
his suspicion. 6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 26/291Midnight. —I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a
few questions on Transylvania history , and he warmed up to the
subject wonderfully . In his speaking of things and people, and
especially of battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he afterwards explained by saying that to a boyar  the pride of
his house and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory , that
their fate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said
“we,” and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I
could put down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most
fascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country . He
grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his
great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his
hands as though he would crush it by main strength. One thing he
said which I shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way
the story of his race:—
“We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the
blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here, in the whirlpo ol of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down
from Icela nd the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them,
which their Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards
of Europe , ay, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought
that the were-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they
came, they found the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth
like a living flame, till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran
the blood  of those old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had
mated with the devils in the desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what
witch was ever so great as Attila, whose  blood is in these veins?” He
held up his arms. “Is it a wonder that we were a conquering race; that
we were proud; that when the Magyar , the Lombard, the Avar, the
Bulgar , or the Turk poured his thousands on our frontiers, we drove
them back? Is it strange that when Arpad and his legions swept
through the Hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached
the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed there? And when
the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were claimed as
kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries was
trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more than
that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say, ‘water
sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.’  Who more gladly than we throughout
the Four Nations received the ‘bloody sword,’  or at its warlike call
flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was redeemed
that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the flags
of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the
Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula
indeed! Woe was it that his own unworthy brother , when he had
fallen, sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery
on them! Was it not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of
his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over
the great river into Turkey-land; who, when he was beaten back,
came again, and again, and again, thoug h he had to come alone from
the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he
knew that he alone  could ultimately triumph! They said that he
thought only of himself.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Bah! what good are peasants without a
leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it?6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 27/291Again, when, after the battle of Mohács, we threw off the Hungarian
yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for our
spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the
Szekelys—and the Dracula as their heart’s blood, their brains, and
their swords—can boast a record that mushroom growths like the
Hapsbur gs and the Romanof fs can never reach. The warlike days are
over. Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable
peace; and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.”
It was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (Mem. ,
this diary seems horribly like the beginning of the “Arabian Nights,”
for everything has to break off at cockcrow—or like the ghost of
Hamlet’ s father .)
 
12 May.—Let me begin with facts—bare, meagre facts, verified
by books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not
confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own
observation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count
came from  his room he began by asking me questions on legal
matters and on the doing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the
day weari ly over books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied,
went over some of the matters I had been examining at Lincoln’ s
Inn. There was a certain method in the Count’ s inquiries, so I shall
try to put them down in sequence; the knowledge may somehow or
some time be useful to me. First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or
more. I told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it
would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one
transaction, as only one could act at a time, and that to change would
be certain to militat e against his interest. He seemed thoroughly to
understand, and went on to ask if there would be any practical
difficulty in having one man to attend, say, to banking, and another
to look after shipping, in case local help were needed in a place far
from the home of the banking solicitor . I asked him to explain more
fully, so that I might not by any chance mislead him, so he said:—
“I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from
under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter , which is far
from London, buys for me through your good self my place at
London. Good! Now  here let me say frankly, lest you should think it
strange that I have sought the services of one so far off from London
instead of some one resident there, that my motive was that no local
interest might be served save my wish only; and as one of London
residence might, perhaps, have some purpose of himself or friend to
serve, I went thus afield to seek my agent, whose labours should be
only to my interest. Now , suppose I, who have much of affairs, wish
to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or Durham, or Harwich, or Dover ,
might it not be that it could with more ease be done by consigning to
one in these ports?” I answered that certainly it would be most easy,
but that we solicitors had a system of agency one for the other , so
that local work could be done locally on instruction from any
solicitor , so that the client, simply placing himself in the hands of
one man, could have his wishes carried out by him without further
trouble. “But,” said he, “I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 28/291“Of course,” I replie d; and “such is often done by men of business,
who do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one
person.”
“Good!” he said, and then went on to ask about the means of
making consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all
sorts of difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be
guarded against. I explained all these things to him to the best of my
ability , and he certainly left me under the impression that he would
have made  a wonderful solicitor , for there was nothing that he did
not think of or foresee. For a man who was never in the country , and
who did not evide ntly do much in the way of business, his
knowledge and acumen were wonderful. When he had satisfied
himself on these points of which he had spoken, and I had verified
all as well as I could by the books available, he suddenly stood up
and said:—
“Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter
Hawkins, or to any other?” It was with some bitterness in my heart
that I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any
opportunity of sending letters to anybody . “Then write now, my young friend,” he said, laying a heavy hand
on my shoulder: “write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it
will please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now .”
“Do you wish me to stay so long?” I asked, for my heart grew cold
at the thought. “I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master ,
employer , what you will, engaged that someone should come on his
behalf, it was understood that my needs  only were to be consulted. I
have not stinted. Is it not so?”
What could I do but bow acceptance?","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"It was Mr. Hawkins’ s
interest, not mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides,
while Count Dracula  was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in
his bearing which made me remember that I was a prisoner , and that
if I wished  it I could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in
my bow, and his mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at
once to use them, but in his own smooth, resistless way:—
“I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of
things other than business in your letters. It will doubtless please
your friends to know  that you are well, and that you look forward to
getting home to them. Is it not so?” As he spoke he handed me three
sheets of note-paper and three envelo pes. They were all of the
thinnest foreign post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing
his quiet smile, with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red
underlip, I understood as well as if he had spoken that I should be
careful what I wrote, for he would be able to read it. So I determined
to write only formal  notes now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in
secret, and also to Mina, for to her I could write in shorthand, which
would puzzle the Count, if he did see it. When I had written my two
letters I sat quiet, reading a book whilst the Count wrote several
notes, referring as he wrote them to some books on his table. Then he
took up my two and placed them with his own, and put by his
writing materials, after which, the instan t the door had closed behind
him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which were face down6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 29/291on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for under the
circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way I
could. One of the letters was directed to Samuel F.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Billington, No. 7, The
Crescent, Whitby , another to Herr Leutner , Varna; the third was to
Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock &
Billreuth, bankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were
unsealed.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I was just about to look at them when I saw the door-
handle move. I sank back in my seat, having just had time to replace
the letters as they had been and to resume my book before the Count,
holding still another  letter in his hand, entered the room. He took up
the letters on the table and stamped them carefully , and then turning
to me, said:—
“I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private
this evening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.” At the
door he turned, and after a moment’ s pause said:—
“Let me advise you, my dear young friend—nay , let me warn you
with all seriousness,  that should you leave these rooms you will not
by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and
has many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep
unwisely . Be warned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be
like to do, then haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for
your rest will then be safe. But if you be not careful in this respect,
then”—He finished his speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned
with his hands as if he were washing them. I quite understood; my
only doub t was as to whether any dream  could be more terrible than
the unnatu ral, horrible net of gloom and mystery which seemed
closing around me. Later .—I endors e the last words written, but this time there is no
doubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is
not. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed—I imagine
that my rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain. When he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not
hearing any sound, I came out and went  up the stone stair to where I
could look out towa rds the South. There was some sense of freedom
in the vast expanse, inaccessible though  it was to me, as compared
with the narrow darkness of the courtya rd. Looking out on this, I felt
that I was indeed in prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh
air, though it were of the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal
existence tell on me. It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own
shadow , and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows
that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place! I
looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow
moonlight till it was almost as light as day. In the soft light the
distant hills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and
gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed to cheer me;
there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew . As I leaned from
the window my eye was caught by some thing moving a storey below
me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of
the rooms, that the windows of the Count’ s own room would look
out. The window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-
mullioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete; but it was6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 30/291evidently many a day since the case had been there. I drew back
behind the stonework, and looked carefully out. What I saw was the Count’ s head comi ng out from the window . I
did not see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the
movement of his back and arms. In any case I could not mistake the
hands which I had had so many opportunities of studying. I was at
first interested and somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small
a matter will interest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner . But my
very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole
man slowly emer ge from the window and begin to crawl down the
castle wall over that dreadful abyss, face down  with his cloak
spreading out around him like great wings. At first I could not
believe my eyes.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I thought it was some trick of the moonlight, some
weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could be no
delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones,
worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using
every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable
speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall. What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the
semblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place
overpowering me; I am in fear—in awful fear—and there is no
escape for me; I am encompassed about with terrors that I dare not
think of.... 15 May.—Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard
fashion. He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet
down, and a good deal to the left. He vanished into some hole or
window . When his head had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see
more, but without avail—the distance was too great to allow a proper
angle of sight. I knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use
the opportunity to explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went
back to the room, and taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were
all locked, as I had expected, and the locks were comparatively new;
but I went down the stone stairs to the hall where I had entered
originally . I found I could pull back the bolts easily enough and
unhook the great chains; but the door was locked, and the key was
gone! That key must be in the Count’ s room; I must watch should his
door be unlocked, so that I may get it and escape. I went on to make
a thorough  examination of the various stairs and passages, and to try
the doors that opene d from them. One or two small rooms near the
hall were open, but there was nothing to see in them except old
furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last, however , I found
one door at the top of the stairway which, though it seemed to be
locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder , and found that it
was not really locke d, but that the resistance came from the fact that
the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door rested on the
floor . Here was an opportunity which I might not have again, so I
exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that I could
enter . I was now in a wing of the castle  further to the right than the
rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could
see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the
windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the
latter side, as well as to the former , there was a great precipice. The6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 31/291castle was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it
was quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where
sling, or bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and
comfort, impossible to a position whic h had to be guarded, were
secured. To the west was a great valley , and then, rising far away ,
great jagged mountain fastnesses, rising  peak on peak, the sheer rock
studded with mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks
and crevices and crannies of the stone. This was evidently the
portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the
furniture had more air of comfort than any I had seen. The windows
were curtainless, and the yellow moonl ight, flooding in through the
diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst it softened
the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure
the ravage s of time and the moth. My lamp seemed to be of little
effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was glad to have it with me,
for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart
and made my nerve s tremble. Still, it was better than living alone in
the rooms which I had come to hate from the presence of the Count,
and after trying a little to school my nerves, I found a soft quietude
come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak table where in old
times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and
many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter , and writing in my diary in
shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is nineteenth
century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my senses
deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own
which mere “modernity” cannot kill. Later: the Morning of 16 May.—God preserve my sanity , for to
this I am reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the
past. Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I
may not go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already . If I be sane, then
surely it is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in
this hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him
alone I can look for safety , even thoug h this be only whilst I can
serve his purpose. Great God!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"merciful God! Let me be calm, for out
of that way lies madness indeed. I begin  to get new lights on certain
things which have puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what
Shakespeare meant when he made Hamlet say:—
“My tablets! quick, my tablets! ’Tis meet that I put it down,” etc.,
for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the
shock had come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for
repose. The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me. The Coun t’s mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it
frightens me more now when I think of it, for in future he has a
fearful hold upon me. I shall fear to doubt what he may say! When I had written  in my diary and had fortunately replaced the
book and pen in my pocket I felt sleepy . The Count’ s warning came
into my mind, but I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of
sleep was upon me, and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as
outrider . The soft moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without
gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me. I determined not to6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 32/291return to-night to the gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where,
of old, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their
gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of
remorseless wars. I drew a great couch out of its place near the
corner , so that as I lay, I could look at the lovely view to east and
south, and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust, composed myself
for sleep. I suppose  I must have fallen asleep; I hope so, but I fear,
for all that followed was startlingly real—so real that now sitting
here in the broad, full sunlight of the morning, I cannot in the least
believe that it was all sleep. I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way
since I came into it; I could see along the floor , in the brilliant
moonlight, my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long
accumulation of dust. In the moonlig ht opposite me were three
young wom en, ladie s by their dress and manner . I thought at the time
that I must be dreaming when I saw them, for, though the moonlight
was behin d them, they threw no shadow on the floor . They came
close to me, and looked at me for some time, and then whispered
together . Two were dark, and had high aquiline noses, like the Count,
and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when
contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was fair, as fair as
can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale
sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it in
connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the
moment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone
like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was
something about them that made me uneasy , some longing and at the
same time some deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning
desire that they would kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to
note this down, lest some day it should meet Mina’ s eyes and cause
her pain; but it is the truth. They whisp ered together , and then they
all three laughed— such a silvery , musical laugh, but as hard as
though the sound never could have come through the softness of
human lips. It was like the intolerable, tingling sweetness of water -
glasses when played on by a cunning hand. The fair girl shook her
head coquettishly , and the other two ur ged her on. One said:—
“Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to
begin.” The other added:—
“He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.” I lay quiet,
looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful
anticipation. The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel
the movem ent of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense,
honey-sweet, and sent the same tinglin g through the nerves as her
voice, but with a bitter underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness,
as one smells in blood. I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly
under the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me,
simply gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was
both thrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually
licked her lips like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the
moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped
the white sharp teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips
went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 33/291fasten on my throat. Then she paused, and I could hear the churning
sound of her tongue  as it licked her teeth and lips, and could feel the
hot breath on my neck. Then the skin of my throat began to tingle as
one’s flesh  does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearer
—nearer . I could feel the soft, shiveri ng touch of the lips on the
super -sensitive skin of my throat, and the hard dents of two sharp
teeth, just touching and pausing there. I closed my eyes in a
languorous ecstasy and waited—waited with beating heart. But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as
lightning. I was conscious of the prese nce of the Count, and of his
being as if lapped  in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened
involuntarily I saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair
woman and with giant’ s power draw it back, the blue eyes
transformed with fury, the white teeth champing with rage, and the
fair cheeks blazing red with passion. But the Count! Never did I
imagine such wrath and fury, even to the demons of the pit. His eyes
were positively blazing. The red light in them was lurid, as if the
flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His face was deathly pale,
and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires; the thick eyebrows
that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white-hot
metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman from
him, and then motioned to the others,  as though he were beating
them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to
the wolve s. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper
seemed to cut through the air and then ring round the room he said:
—
“How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on
him when  I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"This man belongs
to me! Beware how you meddle with him, or you’ll have to deal with
me.” The fair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry , turned to answer
him:—
“You yourself never loved; you never  love!” On this the other
women joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang
through the room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like
the pleasure of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my
face attentively , and said in a soft whisper:—
“Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it
not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you
shall kiss him at your will. Now go!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"go! I must awaken him, for there
is work to be done.”
“Are we to have nothing to-night?” said one of them, with a low
laugh, as she pointed  to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor ,
and which moved as though there were  some living thing within it. For answer he nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward
and opened it. If my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a
low wail, as of a half-smothered child. The women closed round,
whilst I was aghast with horror; but as I looked they disappeared,
and with them the dreadful bag. There was no door near them, and
they could  not have passed me without my noticing. They simply
seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through
the windo w, for I could see outside the dim, shadowy forms for a
moment before they entirely faded away . Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL—continued
I AWOKE in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count
must have  carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject,
but could not arrive  at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there
were certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded
and laid by in a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still
unwound, and I am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing
before going to bed, and many such details. But these things are no
proof, for they may have been evidences that my mind was not as
usual, and, from some cause or anothe r, I had certainly been much
upset. I must watch for proof. Of one thing I am glad: if it was that
the Count  carried me here and undressed me, he must have been
hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I am sure this diary
would have been a mystery to him which he would not have
brooked. He would have taken or destr oyed it. As I look round this
room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of
sanctuary , for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women,
who were—who are—waiting to suck my blood. 18 May.—I have been down  to look at that room  again in daylight,
for I must  know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the
stairs I found it closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the
jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the
bolt of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the
inside. I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"19 May.—I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me
in the suavest tones  to write three letters, one saying that my work
here was nearly done, and that I should  start for home within a few
days, another that I was starting on the next morning from the time
of the letter , and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at
Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state
of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count
whilst I am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to
excite his suspicion  and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know
too much, and that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my
only chance is to prolong my opportunities. Something may occur
which will give me a chance to escape. I saw in his eyes something
of that gathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair
woman from him. He explained to me that posts were few and
uncertain, and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my
friends; and he assured me with so much impressiveness that he
would countermand the later letters, which would be held over at
Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my prolonging
my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new
suspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 35/291him what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute,
and then said:—
“The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third
June 29.”
I know now the span of my life. God help me! 28 May.—There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able
to send word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and
are encamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies; I have
notes of them in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world,
though allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are
thousands of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost
outside all law. They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble
or boyar , and call themselves by his name. They are fearless and
without religion, save superstition, and they talk only their own
varieties of the Romany tongue. I shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have
them posted. I have already spoken them through my window to
begin acquaintanceship. They took their hats off and made obeisance
and many  signs, which, however , I could not understand any more
than I could their spoken language.... I have written the letters. Mina’ s is in shorthand, and I simply ask
Mr. Hawkins to communicate with her. To her I have explained my
situation, but withou t the horrors which I may only surmise. It would
shock and frighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her. Should the letters not carry , then the Count shall not yet know my
secret or the extent of my knowledge.... I have given the letters; I threw them  through the bars of my
window with a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them
posted. The man who took them pressed them to his heart and
bowed, and then put them in his cap. I could do no more. I stole back
to the study, and began to read. As the Count did not come in, I have
written here.... The Coun t has come. He sat down beside me, and said in his
smoothest voice as he opened two letters:—
“The Szga ny has given me these, of which, though I know not
whence they come, I shall, of course, take care. See!”—he must have
looked at it—“one is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the
other”—here he caught sight of the stran ge symbols as he opened the
envelope, and the dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed
wickedly—“the other is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and
hospitality! It is not signed.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Well! so it cannot matter to us.” And he
calmly held letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they
were consumed. Then he went on:—
“The letter to Hawkins—that I shall, of course, send on, since it is
yours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that
unknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?” He
held out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 36/291clean envelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When he went out of the room I could  hear the key turn softly . A
minute later I went over and tried it, and the door was locked. When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room,
his coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was
very court eous and very cheery in his manner , and seeing that I had
been sleeping, he said:—
“So, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"There is the surest rest. I
may not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many
labours to me; but you will sleep, I pray.” I passed to my room and
went to bed, and, strange to say, slept without dreaming. Despair has
its own calms. 31 May.—This morning when I woke I thought I would provide
myself with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them
in my pocket, so that I might write in case I should get an
opportunity , but again a surprise, again a shock! Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my
memoranda, relating  to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in
fact all that might be useful to me were I once outside the castle. I sat
and pondered awhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I
made search of my portmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had
placed my clothes. The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat
and rug; I could find no trace of them anywhere. This looked like
some new scheme of villainy .... 17 June.—This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed
cudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and
pounding and scraping of horses’  feet up the rocky path beyond the
courtyard. With joy I hurried to the window , and saw drive into the
yard two great leiter -wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and
at the head of each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-
studded belt, dirty sheepskin, and high boots. They had also their
long staves in hand. I ran to the door, intending to descend and try
and join them throu gh the main hall, as I thought that way might be
opened for them. Again a shock: my door was fastened on the
outside. Then I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me
stupidly and pointed, but just then the “hetman” of the Szgany came
out, and seeing them pointing to my window , said something, at
which they laughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or
agonised entreaty , would make them  even look at me.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"They
resolutely turned away . The leiter -wagons contained great, square
boxes, with handles of thick rope; these  were evidently empty by the
ease with which the Slovaks handled them, and by their resonance as
they were roughly moved. When they were all unloaded and packed
in a great heap in one corner of the yard, the Slovaks were given
some money by the Szgany , and spittin g on it for luck, lazily went
each to his horse’ s head. Shortly afterwards, I heard the cracking of
their whips die away in the distance. 6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 37/29124 June, befor e morning. —Last night the Count left me early , and
locked himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up the
winding stair, and looked out of the window , which opened south. I
thought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going
on. The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing
work of some kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away
muffled sound as of mattock and spade , and, whatever it is, it must
be the end of some ruthless villainy . I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I
saw somet hing coming out of the Count’ s window . I drew back and
watched carefully , and saw the whole man emer ge. It was a new
shock to me to find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had
worn whilst travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible
bag which  I had seen the women take away . There could be no doubt
as to his quest, and in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of
evil: that he will allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may
both leave evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages
posting my own letters, and that any wickedness which he may do
shall by the local people be attributed to me. It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut
up here, a veritable prisoner , but witho ut that protection of the law
which is even a criminal’ s right and consolation. I thought I would watch for the Count’ s return, and for a long time
sat doggedly at the window . Then I began to notice that there were
some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They
were like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and
gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a
sense of soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in
the embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy
more fully the aërial gambolling. Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs
somewhere far below in the valley , whic h was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to
take new shapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt
myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my
very soul was struggling, and my half-remembered sensibilities were
striving to answer the call. I was becom ing hypnotised! Quicker and
quicker danced the dust; the moonbeams seemed to quiver as they
went by me into the mass of gloom beyond. More and more they
gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes. And then I
started, broad awake and in full posse ssion of my senses, and ran
screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were
becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of
the three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt
somewhat safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and
where the lamp was burning brightly . When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in
the Count’ s room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed;
and then there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison,
and could do nothing. I sat down and simply cried. As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without—the agonised
cry of a woman. I rushed to the window , and throwing it up, peered6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 38/291out betwee n the bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled
hair, holding her hands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning against a corner of the gateway . When she saw my
face at the window she threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice
laden with menace:—
“Monster , give me my child!”
She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the
same word s in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair
and beat her breast , and abandoned herself to all the violences of
extravagant emotion. Finally , she threw herself forward, and, though
I could not see her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands
against the door . Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower , I heard the
voice of the Count calling in his harsh , metallic whisper . His call
seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-
up dam when liberated, through the wide entrance into the courtyard. There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves
was but short. Befo re long they streamed away singly , licking their
lips. I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child,
and she was better dead. What shall I do?","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"what can I do? How can I escape from this
dreadful thing of night and gloom and fear? 25 June, morning. —No man knows till he has suffered from the
night how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can
be. When the sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of
the great gateway opposite my windo w, the high spot which it
touched seemed to me as if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as if it had been  a vaporous garment which
dissolved in the warmth. I must take action of some sort whilst the
courage of the day is upon me. Last night one of my post-dated
letters went to post, the first of that fatal series which is to blot out
the very traces of my existence from the earth. Let me not think of it.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Action! It has always been at night-time that I have been molested or
threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen
the Count in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake,
that he may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his
room! But there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no
way for me. Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has
gone why may not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl
from his window . Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his
window? The chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate
still.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I shall risk it. At the worst it can only be death; and a man’ s
death is not a calf’s, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to
me. God help me in my task! Good-by e, Mina, if I fail; good-bye,

Same day, later.—I have made the effort, and God, helping me,
have come safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in
order . I went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on
the south side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone
which runs around the building on this side. The stones are big and
roughly cut, and the mortar has by process of time been washed
away between them. I took off my boots, and ventured out on the
desperate way.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I looked down once, so as to make sure that a sudden
glimpse of the awfu l depth would not overcome me, but after that
kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty well the direction and
distance of the Count’ s window , and made for it as well as I could,
having regard to the opportunities available. I did not feel dizzy—I
suppose I was too excited—and the time seemed ridiculously short
till I found  myself standing on the wind ow-sill and trying to raise up
the sash. I was filled with agitation, however , when I bent down and
slid feet foremost in through the window . Then I looked around for
the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery . The
room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which
seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the
same style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I
looked for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it
anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one
corner—gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and
Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of
dust, as though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I
noticed was less than three hundred years old. There were also
chains and ornaments, some jewelled , but all of them old and
stained. At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I
could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which
was the main object of my search, I must make further examination,
or all my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a
stone passage to a circular stairway , which went steeply down. I
descended, minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark,
being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry . At the bottom there
was a dark, tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly ,
sickly odour , the odour of old earth newly turned. As I went through
the passage the smel l grew closer and heavier . At last I pulled open a
heavy door which stood ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined
chapel, which had evidently been used as a graveyard. The roof was
broken, and in two places were steps leading to vaults, but the
ground had recently been dug over, and the earth placed in great
wooden boxes, manifestly those whic h had been brought by the
Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for any further
outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of the
ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the vaults,
where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to my
very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments
of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however , I made a
discovery . There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all,
on a pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 40/291asleep, I could not say which—for the eyes were open and stony , but
without the glassiness of death—and the cheeks had the warmth of
life throug h all their pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there
was no sign of movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the
heart. I bent over him, and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain there long, for the earthy smell would have
passed away in a few hours. By the side of the box was its cover ,
pierced with holes here and there. I thought he might have the keys
on him, but when I went to search I saw the dead eyes, and in them,
dead though they were, such a look of hate, though unconscious of
me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and leaving the
Count’ s room by the window , crawled again up the castle wall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried
to think.... 29 June. —To-day is the date of my last letter , and the Count has
taken steps to prove that it was genuin e, for again I saw him leave
the castle by the same window , and in my clothes. As he went down
the wall, lizard fashi on, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon,
that I might destroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by
man’ s hand would have any effect on him. I dared not wait to see
him return, for I feared to see those weird sisters. I came back to the
library , and read there till I fell asleep. I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a
man can look as he said:—
“To-morrow , my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful
England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may
never meet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall
not be here, but all shall be ready for your journey . In the morning
come the Szgany , who have some labou rs of their own here, and also
come some Slovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come
for you, and shall bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence
from Bukovina to Bistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of
you at Castle Dracula.” I suspected him, and determined to test his
sincerity . Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it
in connection with such a monster , so asked him point-blank:—
“Why may I not go to-night?”
“Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a
mission.”
“But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.” He
smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was
some trick behind his smoothness. He said:—
“And your baggage?”
“I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.”
The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made
me rub my eyes, it seemed so real:—
“You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its
spirit is that which rules our boyars : ‘Welcom e the coming; speed the
parting guest.’  Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour
shall you wait in my house against your will, though sad am I at your
going, and that you so suddenly desire it. Come!” With a stately6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 41/291gravity , he, with the lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the
hall. Suddenly he stopped. “Hark!”
Close at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as
if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a
great orchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor . After
a pause of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door,
drew back the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and
began to draw it open. To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously , I looked all round, but could see no key of any kind. As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without
grew louder and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and
their blunt -clawed feet as they leaped, came in through the opening
door. I knew then that to struggle at the moment against the Count
was usele ss. With such allies as these at his command, I could do
nothing. But still the door continued slowly to open, and only the
Count’ s body stood in the gap. Suddenl y it struck me that this might
be the moment and means of my doom ; I was to be given to the
wolves, and at my own instigation. There was a diabolical
wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and as a last
chance I cried out:—
“Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!” and covered my face
with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one
sweep of his powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the
great bolts  clanged and echoed through  the hall as they shot back
into their places. In silence we returned to the library , and after a minute or two I
went to my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his
kissing his hand to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and
with a smile that Judas in hell might be proud of. When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a
whispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my
ears deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:—
“Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Wait! Have patie nce! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!” There
was a low, sweet ripple of laughter , and in a rage I threw open the
door, and saw without the three terrible women licking their lips. As
I appeared they all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away . I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then
so near the end?","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"To-morrow! to-morrow ! Lord, help me, and those to
whom I am dear! 30 June, morning. —These may be the last words I ever write in
this diary . I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw
myself on my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should
find me ready . At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the
morning had come. Then came the welcome cock-crow , and I felt
that I was safe. With a glad heart, I open ed my door and ran down to
the hall. I had seen that the door was unlocked, and now escape was6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 42/291before me. With hands that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the
chains and drew back the massive bolts. But the door would not move. Despair  seized me. I pulled, and
pulled, at the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its
casement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the
Count. Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I
determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the
Count’ s room. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier
choice of evils. Without a pause I rushe d up to the east window , and
scrambled down the wall, as before, into the Count’ s room. It was
empty , but that was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere,
but the heap of gold remained. I went through the door in the corner
and down  the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old
chapel. I knew now well enough where to find the monster I sought. The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but
the lid was laid on it, not fastened down , but with the nails ready in
their place s to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for
the key, so I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then
I saw something which filled my very soul with horror . There lay the
Count, but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the
white hair and moustache were changed  to dark iron-grey; the cheeks
were fuller , and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the
mouth was redder than ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh
blood, which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the
chin and neck. Even the deep, burnin g eyes seemed set amongst
swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated. It
seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with
blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion. I
shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in me
revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The coming
night might see my own body a banqu et in a similar way to those
horrid three. I felt all over the body , but no sign could I find of the
key. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking
smile on the bloated face which seemed  to drive me mad. This was
the being I was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for
centuries to come he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his
lust for blood, and create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-
demons to batten on the helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A
terrible desire came  upon me to rid the world of such a monster . There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a shovel which the
workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting it high, struck,
with the edge downw ard, at the hateful face. But as I did so the head
turned, and the eyes fell full upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk
horror . The sight seemed to paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my
hand and glanced from the face, merely  making a deep gash above
the forehead. The shovel fell from my hand across the box, and as I
pulled it away the flange of the blade  caught the edge of the lid
which fell over again, and hid the horrid thing from my sight. The
last glimp se I had was of the bloated face, blood-stained and fixed
with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the
nethermost hell.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 43/291I thought and though t what should be my next move, but my brain
seemed on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over
me. As I waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry
voices coming closer , and through their song the rolling of heavy
wheels and the cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of
whom the Count had spoken were coming. With a last look around
and at the box which contained the vile body , I ran from the place
and gained  the Count’ s room, determined to rush out at the moment
the door should be opened. With strained ears, I listened, and heard
downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the falling
back of the heavy door. There must have been some other means of
entry , or some one had a key for one of the locked doors. Then there
came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some
passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to run down again
towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance; but at the
moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the door to
the windin g stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the
lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was
hopelessly fast. I was again a prisone r, and the net of doom was
closing round me more closely . As I write  there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping
feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily , doubtless the
boxes, with their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it
is the box being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet
tramping again along the hall, with many other idle feet coming
behind them. The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the
key in the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens
and shuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt. Hark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy
wheels, the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass
into the distance. I am alone in the castle with those awful women.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Faugh! Mina is a
woman, and there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit! I shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle
wall farther than I have yet attempted. I shall take some of the gold
with me, lest I want it later. I may find a way from this dreadful
place. And then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away from this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil
and his children still walk with earthly feet! At least God’s merc y is better than that of these monsters, and the
precipice is steep and high. At its foot a man may sleep—as a man.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

Letter fr om Miss Mina Murray to Miss Lucy W estenra. “9 May . “My dearest Lucy ,—
“Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply
overwhelmed with work. The life of an assistant schoolmistress is
sometimes trying. I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where
we can talk togethe r freely and build our castles in the air. I have
been work ing very hard lately , because I want to keep up with
Jonathan’ s studies, and I have been practising shorthand very
assiduously . When we are married I shall be able to be useful to
Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I can take down what
he wants to say in this way and write it out for him on the typewriter ,
at which also I am practising very hard. He and I sometimes write
letters in shorthand,  and he is keeping a stenographic journal of his
travels abroad. Whe n I am with you I shall keep a diary in the same
way. I don’t mean one of those two-pag es-to-the-week-with-Sunday-
squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a sort of journal which I can write
in whenever I feel inclined. I do not suppose there will be much of
interest to other people; but it is not intended for them. I may show it
to Jonatha n some day if there is in it anything worth sharing, but it is
really an exercise book. I shall try to do what I see lady journalists
do: interviewing and writing descriptions and trying to remember
conversations. I am told that, with a little practice, one can remember
all that goes on or that one hears said during a day. However , we
shall see.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I will tell you of my little plans when we meet. I have just
had a few hurried lines from Jonathan from Transylvania. He is well,
and will be returning in about a week. I am longing to hear all his
news. It must be so nice to see strange countries. I wonder if we—I
mean Jonathan and I—shall ever see them together . There is the ten
o’clock bell ringing. Good-bye. “Your loving

anything for a long time. I hear rumours, and especially of a tall,
handsome, curly-haired man???”

“I must say you tax me very unfairly with being a bad
correspondent. I wrote to you twice  since we parted, and your last
letter was only your second . Besides, I have nothing to tell you.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"There is really nothing to interest you. Town is very pleasant just
now, and we go a good deal to picture-galleries and for walks and
rides in the park. As to the tall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was
the one who was with me at the last Pop. Some one has evidently6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

"Holmw ood. He often comes to see
us, and he and mam ma get on very well together; they have so many
things to talk about in common. We met some time ago a man that
would just do for you, if you were not already engaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent parti , being handsome, well off, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever . Just fancy! He is only nine-and-
twenty , and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under his own
care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to see
us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men I
ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has a curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying
to read one’s thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I
flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my
glass. Do you ever try to read your own face? I do, and I can tell you
it is not a bad study , and gives you more trouble than you can well
fancy if you have never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious
psychological study , and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know ,
take sufficient interest in dress to be able to describe the new
fashions. Dress is a bore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur
says that every day. There, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our
secrets to each other since we were childr en; we have slept together
and eaten together , and laughed and cried together; and now, though
I have spoken, I would like to speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn’ t you
guess? I love him. I am blushing as I write, for although I think  he
loves me, he has not told me so in words. But oh, Mina, I love him; I
love him; I love him! There, that does me good. I wish I were with
you, dear, sitting by the fire undressing, as we used to sit; and I
would try to tell you what I feel. I do not know how I am writing this
even to you. I am afraid to stop, or I should tear up the letter , and I
don’t want to stop, for I do so want to tell you all. Let me hear from
you at once , and tell me all that you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good-night. Bless me in your prayer s; and, Mina, pray for my
happiness. “LUCY . “P.S.—I need not tell you this is a secret. Good-night again. “L.”
Letter , Lucy W estenra to Mina Murray . “24 May . “My dearest Mina,—
“Thanks, and thanks , and thanks again for your sweet letter . It was
so nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy . “My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs
are. Here am I, who shall be twenty in September , and yet I never
had a proposal till to-day , not a real proposal, and to-day I have had
three. Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn’t it awful! I feel
sorry , really and truly sorry , for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I
am so happy that I don’t know what to do with myself. And three
proposals! But, for goodness’  sake, don’t tell any of the girls, or they
would be getting all sorts of extrav agant ideas and imagining
themselves injured and slighted if in their very first day at home they
did not get six at least. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear,6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

married women, can despise vanity . Well, I must tell you about the
three, but you must keep it a secret, dear, from every one, except, of
course, Jonathan. You will tell him, because I would, if I were in
your place, certainly tell Arthur . A wom an ought to tell her husband
everything—don’ t you think so, dear?—and I must be fair. Men like
women, certainly their wives, to be quite as fair as they are; and
women, I am afraid, are not always quite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just before lunch.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I told you of
him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum man, with the strong jaw
and the good forehe ad. He was very cool outwardly , but was nervous
all the same. He had evidently been schooling himself as to all sorts
of little things, and remembered them; but he almost managed to sit
down on his silk hat, which men don’t generally do when they are
cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept playing with
a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to me,
Mina, very straightforwardly . He told me how dear I was to him,
though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with
me to help and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he
would be if I did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said
that he was a brute and would not add to my present trouble. Then he
broke off and asked if I could love him in time; and when I shook my
head his hands trembled, and then with some hesitation he asked me
if I cared already for any one else. He put it very nicely , saying that
he did not want to wring my confidence  from me, but only to know ,
because if a woman’ s heart was free a man might have hope. And
then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was some one. I
only told him that much, and then he stood up, and he looked very
strong and very grave as he took both my hands in his and said he
hoped I would be happy , and that if I ever wanted a friend I must
count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can’t help crying: and
you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being proposed to is all
very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn’t at all a happy thing
when you have to see a poor fellow , whom you know loves you
honestly , going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to know
that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing quite
out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so
miserable, though I am so happy .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"“Evening. “Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left
off, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number
Two came  after lunch.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"He is such a nice fellow , an American from
Texas, and he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost
impossible that he has been to so many places and has had such
adventures. I sympathise with poor Desd emona when she had such a
dangerous stream poured in her ear, even by a black man. I suppose
that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us
from fears , and we marry him. I know now what I would do if I were
a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I don’t, for there was
Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never told any, and yet
—— My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P. Morris
found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl alone. No, he doesn’ t, for Arthur tried twice to make  a chance, and I helping
him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I must tell you6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 47/291beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn’ t always speak slang—that is to
say, he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well
educated and has exquisite manners—but he found out that it amused
me to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present,
and there was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am
afraid, my dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever
else he has to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself
if I shall ever speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have
never heard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me
and looked as happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the
same that he was very nervous. He took my hand in his, and said
ever so sweetly:—
“‘Miss Lucy, I know I ain’t good enough to regulate the fixin’ s of
your little shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is
you will go join them seven young wom en with the lamps when you
quit. Won’t you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the
long road together , driving in double harness?’
“Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn’ t
seem half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said,
as lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and
that I wasn’ t broken  to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had
spoken in a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake
in doing so on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would
forgive him. He really did look serious when he was saying it, and I
couldn’ t help feeling a bit serious too— I know , Mina, you will think
me a horrid flirt—though I couldn’ t help feeling a sort of exultation
that he was numbe r two in one day. And then, my dear, before I
could say a word he began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-
making, laying his very heart and soul at my feet. He looked so
earnest over it that I shall never again think that a man must be
playful always, and never earnest, because he is merry at times. I
suppose he saw something in my face which checked him, for he
suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of manly fervour that I could
have loved him for if I had been free:—
“‘Lucy , you are an honest-hearted girl, I know . I should not be
here speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit,
right throu gh to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good
fellow to another , is there any one else that you care for? And if there
is I’ll never trouble you a hair’s breadth again, but will be, if you will
let me, a very faithful friend.’
“My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so
little worthy of them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-
hearted, true gentleman. I burst into tears—I am afraid, my dear, you
will think  this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one—and I
really felt very badly . Why can’t they let a girl marry three men, or as
many as want her, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy , and I
must not say it.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able
to look into Mr . Morris’ s brave eyes, and I told him out straight:—
“‘Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that
he even loves me.’ I was right to speak to him so frankly , for quite a
light came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine
—I think I put them into his—and said in a hearty way:—6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 48/291“‘That’ s my brave girl. It’s better worth  being late for a chance of
winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Don’ t
cry, my dear.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"If it’s for me, I’m a hard nut to crack; and I take it
standing up. If that other fellow doesn’ t know his happiness, well,
he’d bette r look for it soon, or he’ll have to deal with me. Little girl,
your hone sty and pluck have made me a friend, and that’s rarer than
a lover; it’s more unselfish anyhow . My dear, I’m going to have a
pretty lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won’t you give
me one kiss? It’ll be something to keep off the darkness now and
then. You can, you know, if you like, for that other good fellow—he
must be a good fellow, my dear, and a fine fellow , or you could not
love him— hasn’ t spoken yet.’ That quite won me, Mina, for it was
brave and sweet of him, and noble, too, to a rival—wasn’ t it?—and
he so sad; so I leant over and kissed him. He stood up with my two
hands in his, and as he looked down into my face—I am afraid I was
blushing very much—he said:—
“‘Little girl, I hold your hand, and you’ve kissed me, and if these
things don’t make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your
sweet honesty to me, and good-bye.’  He wrung my hand, and taking
up his hat, went straight out of the room without looking back,
without a tear or a quiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby . Oh,
why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots of
girls about who would worship the very ground he trod on? I know I
would if I were free—only I don’t want to be free. My dear, this
quite upset me, and I feel I cannot write of happiness just at once,
after tellin g you of it; and I don’t wish  to tell of the number three
until it can be all happy . “Ever your loving

Three, need I? Besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only a
moment from his coming into the room till both his arms were round
me, and he was kissing me. I am very, very happy , and I don’t know
what I have done to deserve it. I must only try in the future to show
that I am not ungrate ful to God for all His goodness to me in sending
to me such a lover , such a husband, and such a friend. “Good-bye.”

MINA MURRAY’S JOURNAL
24 July. Whitby .—Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and
lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in
which they have rooms.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"This is a lovely place. The little river, the
Esk, runs through a deep valley , which broadens out as it comes near
the harbou r. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through
which the view seem s somehow further away than it really is. The
valley is beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the
high land on either side you look right across it, unless you are near
enough to see down. The houses of the old town—the side away
from us—are all red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other
anyhow , like the pictures we see of Nurember g. Right over the town
is the ruin of Whitb y Abbey , which was sacked by the Danes, and
which is the scene of part of “Marmion, ” where the girl was built up
in the wall. It is a most noble ruin, of immense size, and full of
beautiful and romantic bits; there is a legend that a white lady is seen
in one of the windows. Between it and the town there is another
church, the parish one, round which is a big graveyard, all full of
tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in Whitby , for it lies
right over the town, and has a full view of the harbour and all up the
bay to where the headland called Kettleness stretches out into the
sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has
fallen away , and some of the graves have been destroyed. In one
place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the sandy
pathway far below . There are walks, with seats beside them, through
the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long looking at
the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and sit here
very often  myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my book
on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are sitting
beside me.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and talk. The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite
wall stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of
it, in the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs
along outside of it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow
crooked inversely , and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two
piers there is a narrow opening into the harbour , which then suddenly
widens. It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to
nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between
banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this
side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of
which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end
of it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather , and sends in
a mournfu l sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a
ship is lost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about
this; he is coming this way ....6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 51/291He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all
gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is
nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing
fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical
person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White
Lady at the abbey he said very brusquely:—
“I wouldn’ t fash masel’ about them, miss. Them things be all wore
out.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Mind, I don’t say that they never was, but I do say that they
wasn’ t in my time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an’
the like, but not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from
York and Leeds that be always eatin’  cured herrin’ s an’ drinkin’  tea
an’ lookin’  out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel’
who’d be bothered tellin’  lies to them—even the newspapers, which
is full of fool-talk.” I thought he woul d be a good person to learn
interesting things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me
something about the whale-fishing in the old days. He was just
settling himself to begin when the clock struck six, whereupon he
laboured to get up, and said:—
“I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter
doesn’ t like to be kept waitin’  when the tea is ready , for it takes me
time to crammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of ’em; an’,
miss, I lack belly-timber sairly by the clock.”
He hobbled away , and I could see him hurrying, as well as he
could, down the steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from the town up to the church, there are hundreds of
them—I do not know how many—and they wind up in a delicate
curve; the slope is so gentle that a horse could easily walk up and
down them. I think they must originally have had something to do
with the abbey . I shall go home too. Lucy went out visiting with her
mother , and as they were only duty calls, I did not go. They will be
home by this. 1 August. —I came up here an hour ago with Lucy , and we had a
most interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who
always come and join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them,
and I should think must have been in his time a most dictatorial
person. He will not admit anything, and downfaces everybody . If he
can’t out-ar gue them he bullies them, and then takes their silence for
agreement with his views. Lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her
white lawn frock; she has got a beautiful colour since she has been
here. I noticed that the old men did not lose any time in coming up
and sitting near her when we sat down. She is so sweet with old
people; I think they all fell in love with her on the spot. Even my old
man succu mbed and did not contradict her, but gave me double share
instead. I got him on the subject of the legends, and he went off at
once into a sort of sermon. I must try to remember it and put it down:
—
“It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that’s what it be, an’

https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 52/291somethin’  that they don’t other incline to. It makes me ireful to think
o’ them. Why, it’s them that, not conten t with printin’  lies on paper
an’ preachin’  them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin’  them on the
tombstones. Look here all around you in what airt ye will; all them
steans, holdin’ up their heads as well as they can out of their pride, is
acant—simply tumblin’  down with the weight o’ the lies wrote on
them, ‘Here lies the body’  or ‘Sacred to the memory’  wrote on all of
them, an’ yet in nigh half of them there bean’ t no bodies at all; an’
the memories of them bean’ t cared a pinch of snuff about, much less
sacred. Lies all of them, nothin’  but lies of one kind or another! My
gog, but it’ll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when
they come tumblin’  up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an’
tryin’  to drag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they
was; some of them  trimmlin’  and ditherin’, with their hands that
dozzened an’ slippy from lyin’ in the sea that they can’t even keep
their grup o’  them.”
I could see from the old fellow’ s self-s atisfied air and the way in
which he looked round for the approva l of his cronies that he was
“showing of f,” so I put in a word to keep him going:—
“Oh, Mr. Swales, you can’t be serious . Surely these tombstones
are not all wrong?”
“Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin’  where
they make out the people too good; for there be folk that do think a
balm-bowl be like the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be
only lies. Now look you here; you come here a stranger , an’ you see
this kirk-garth.” I nodded, for I though t it better to assent, though I
did not quite understand his dialect. I knew it had something to do
with the church. He went on: “And you consate that all these steans
be aboon folk that be happed here, snod an’ snog?” I assented again. “Then that be just where the lie comes in. Why , there be scores of
these lay-beds that be toom as old Dun’s ’bacca-box on Friday
night.” He nudged one of his companions, and they all laughed. “And my gog!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"how could they be otherwise? Look at that one, the
aftest abaft the bier -bank: read it!” I went over and read:—
“Edward Spencelagh, master mariner , murdered by pirates off the
coast of Andres, April, 1854, æt. 30.” When I came back Mr.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Swales
went on:—
“Who brought him home, I wonder , to hap him here? Murdered
off the coast of Andres! an’ you consated his body lay under! Why , I
could name ye a dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas
above”—he pointed  northwards—“or where the currents may have
drifted them. There be the steans around  ye. Ye can, with your young
eyes, read the small-print of the lies from here. This Braithwaite
Lowrey—I knew his father , lost in the Lively  off Greenland in ’20; or
Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the same seas in 1777; or John
Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year later; or old John
Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned in the Gulf of
Finland in ’50. Do ye think that all these men will have to make a
rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds ? I have me antherums aboot
it! I tell ye that when they got here they’d be jommlin’  an’ jostlin’
one anothe r that way that it ’ud be like a fight up on the ice in the old
days, when we’d be at one another from  daylight to dark, an’ tryin’  to
tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.” This was evidently6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 53/291local pleasantry , for the old man cackled over it, and his cronies
joined in with gusto. “But,” I said, “surely  you are not quite correct, for you start on the
assumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to take
their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment. Do you think
that will be really necessary?”
“Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me that, miss!”
“To please their relatives, I suppose.”
“To please  their relatives, you suppose!”  This he said with intense
scorn. “How will it pleasure their relativ es to know that lies is wrote
over them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?”
He pointed  to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab,
on which the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. “Read the
lies on that thruf f-stean,” he said. The letters were upside down to me
from wher e I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant
over and read:—
“Sacred to the memory of Geor ge Canon , who died, in the hope of
a glorious  resurrection, on July, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at
Kettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her
dearly beloved son.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"‘He was the only son of his mother , and she was
a widow .’ Really , Mr. Swales, I don’t see anything very funny in
that!” She spoke her comment very gravely and somewhat severely . “Ye don’t see aught funny! Ha!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"ha! But that’s because ye don’t
gawm the sorrowin’  mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he
was acrewk’d—a regular lamiter he was—an’  he hated her so that he
committed suicide in order that she migh tn’t get an insurance she put
on his life. He blew  nigh the top of his head off with an old musket
that they had for scarin’  the crows with. ’Twarn’ t for crows then, for
it brought the clegs and the dowps to him. That’ s the way he fell off
the rocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I’ve often
heard him say masel’  that he hoped he’d go to hell, for his mother
was so pious that she’d be sure to go to heaven, an’ he didn’ t want to
addle where she was. Now isn’t that stean at any rate”—he
hammered it with his stick as he spoke— “a pack of lies? and won’ t it
make Gabriel keckle when Geordie comes pantin’  up the grees with
the tombstean balanced on his hump, and asks it to be took as
evidence!”
I did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as
she said, rising up:—
“Oh, why did you tell us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I
cannot leave it; and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of
a suicide.”
“That won’ t harm ye, my pretty; an’ it may make poor Geordie
gladsome to have so trim a lass sittin’  on his lap. That won’ t hurt ye. Why , I’ve sat here off an’ on for nigh twenty years past, an’ it hasn’ t
done me no harm. Don’t ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that
doesn’  lie there eithe r! It’ll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye
see the tombsteans all run away with,  and the place as bare as a
stubble-field. There’ s the clock, an’ I must gang.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"My service to ye,
ladies!” And of f he hobbled. Lucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we
took hands as we sat; and she told me all over again about Arthur and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 54/291their coming marriage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for I
haven’ t heard from Jonathan for a whole month. The same day. I came up here alone, for I am very sad. There was
no letter for me. I hope there cannot be anything the matter with
Jonathan. The clock has just struck nine. I see the lights scattered all
over the town, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and
sometimes singly; they run right up the Esk and die away in the
curve of the valley . To my left the view is cut off by a black line of
roof of the old house next the abbey . The sheep and lambs are
bleating in the fields away behind me, and there is a clatter of a
donkey’ s hoofs up the paved road below. The band on the pier is
playing a harsh waltz in good time, and further along the quay there
is a Salva tion Army  meeting in a back street. Neither of the bands
hears the other , but up here I hear and see them both. I wonder where
Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me! I wish he were here. Dr. Sewar d’s Diary . 5 June.—The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I
get to understand the man. He has certain qualities very largely
developed; selfishness, secrecy , and purpose. I wish I could get at
what is the object of the latter . He seems to have some settled
scheme of his own, but what it is I do not yet know . His redeeming
quality is a love of animals, though, indeed, he has such curious
turns in it that I sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His
pets are of odd sorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at
present such a quantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my
astonishment, he did not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took
the matter in simple  seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then
said: “May  I have three days? I shall clear them away .” Of course, I
said that would do. I must watch him.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"18 June. —He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got
several very big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them with his
flies, and the numbe r of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished,
although he has used half his food in attracting more flies from
outside to his room. 1 July.—His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his
flies, and to-day I told him that he must get rid of them. He looked
very sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all
events. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same
time as before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him,
for when a horrid blow-fly , bloated with some carrion food, buzzed
into the room, he caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments
between his finger and thumb, and, before I knew what he was going
to do, put it in his mouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he
argued quietly that it was very good and very wholesome; that it was
life, strong life, and gave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the
rudiment of one. I must watch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has
evidently some deep problem in his mind, for he keeps a little note-
book in which he is always jotting down  something. Whole pages of
it are filled with masses of figures, generally single numbers added6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 55/291up in batches, and then the totals added  in batches again, as though
he were “focussing” some account, as the auditors put it. 8 July.—There is a metho d in his madness, and the rudimentary
idea in my mind is growing.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"It will be a whole idea soon, and then,
oh, uncon scious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your
conscious brother . I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that
I might notice if there were any change .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Things remain as they were
except that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He has managed to get a sparrow , and has already partially tamed it. His means of taming is simple, for already the spiders have
diminished. Those that do remain, however , are well fed, for he still
brings in the flies by tempting them with his food. 19 July.—We are progressing. My friend has now a whole colony
of sparrow s, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. When I
came in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour—a
very, very great favour; and as he spoke  he fawned on me like a dog. I asked him what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his
voice and bearing:—
“A kitten,  a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with,
and teach, and feed—and feed—and feed!” I was not unprepared for
this request, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size
and vivacity , but I did not care that his pretty family of tame
sparrows should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the
spiders; so I said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not
rather have a cat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he
answered:—
“Oh, yes, I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you
should refuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would
they?” I shook my head, and said that at present I feared it would not
be possible, but that I would see about it. His face fell, and I could
see a warning of danger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong
look which meant killing. The man is an undeveloped homicidal
maniac. I shall test him with his present craving and see how it will
work out; then I shall know more. 10 p. m.—I have visited him again and found  him sitting in a
corner brooding. When I came in he threw himself on his knees
before me and implored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation
depended upon it. I was firm, however , and told him that he could
not have it, whereu pon he went without a word, and sat down,
gnawing his fingers, in the corner where I had found him. I shall see
him in the morning early . 20 July.—Visited Renfield very early , before the attendant went
his rounds. Found him up and humming a tune. He was spreading
out his sugar , which he had saved, in the window , and was
manifestly beginning his fly-catching again; and beginning it
cheerfully and with a good grace. I looked around for his birds, and
not seeing them, asked him where they were. He replied, without
turning round, that they had all flown away . There were a few6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 56/291feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of blood. I said
nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if there were
anything odd about him during the day .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"11 a. m.—The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield
has been very sick and has disgor ged a whole lot of feathers. “My
belief is, doctor ,” he said, “that he has eaten his birds, and that he just
took and ate them raw!”
 
11 p. m.—I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-nigh t, enough to make
even him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. The
thought that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and
the theory proved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall
have to invent a new classification for him, and call him a
zoöphagous (life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as
many lives as he can, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a
cumulative way. He gave many flies to one spider and many spiders
to one bird, and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would
have been  his later steps? It would almost be worth while to
complete the experiment. It might be done if there were only a
sufficient cause. Men sneered at vivis ection, and yet look at its
results to-day! Why not advance science in its most difficult and vital
aspect—the knowle dge of the brain? Had I even the secret of one
such mind —did I hold the key to the fancy of even one lunatic—I
might advance my own branch of science to a pitch compared with
which Burdon-Sand erson’ s physiology or Ferrier ’s brain-knowledge
would be as nothing . If only there were a sufficient cause! I must not
think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good cause might turn
the scale with me, for may not I too be of an exceptional brain,
congenitally? How well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own
scope. I wonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has closed the account most accurately , and to-day begun a new
record. How many of us begin a new record with each day of our
lives? To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my
new hope, and that truly I began a new record. So it will be until the
Great Recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a
balance to profit or loss. Oh, Lucy , Lucy , I cannot be angry with you,
nor can I be angry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I
must only wait on hopeless and work. Work! work! If I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there
—a good,  unselfish cause to make me work—that would be indeed
happiness. Mina Murray’ s Journal. 26 July.—I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here;
it is like whispering to one’s self and listening at the same time. And
there is also someth ing about the shorthand symbols that makes it
different from writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very
concerned; but yesterday dear Mr. Haw kins, who is always so kind,
sent me a letter from him. I had written asking him if he had heard,6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

dated from Castle Dracula, and says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan; I do not understand it, and it makes me
uneasy . Then, too, Lucy , although she is so well, has lately taken to
her old habit of walking in her sleep. Her mother has spoken to me
about it, and we have decided that I am to lock the door of our room
every night. Mrs. Westenra has got an idea that sleep-walkers always
go out on roofs of houses and along the edges of cliffs and then get
suddenly wakened and fall over with a despairing cry that echoes all
over the place. Poor dear, she is naturally anxious about Lucy , and
she tells me that her husband, Lucy’ s father , had the same habit; that
he would get up in the night and dress himself and go out, if he were
not stoppe d. Lucy is to be married in the autumn, and she is already
planning out her dresses and how her house is to be arranged. I
sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan and I will start
in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to make both ends
meet. Mr.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Holmwoo d—he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only son of
Lord Goda lming—is coming up here very shortly—as soon as he can
leave town , for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is
counting the momen ts till he comes. She wants to take him up to the
seat on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby . I
daresay it is the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right
when he arrives. 27 July.—No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about
him, thoug h why I should I do not know; but I do wish that he would
write, if it were only a single line. Lucy walks more than ever, and
each night I am awakened by her moving about the room. Fortunately , the weather is so hot that she cannot get cold; but still
the anxiety  and the perpetually being wakened is beginning to tell on
me, and I am getting nervous and wakeful myself. Thank God,
Lucy’ s health keeps up.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Mr. Holmwood has been suddenly called to
Ring to see his fathe r, who has been taken seriously ill. Lucy frets at
the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch her looks; she

drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey mist. All is vastness; the
clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and there is a “brool” over the
sea that sounds like some presage of doom. Dark figures are on the

straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that he
wants to talk.... I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he sat down beside me, he said in a very gentle way:—
“I want to say something to you, miss.”  I could see he was not at
ease, so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to
speak fully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:—
“I’m afraid, my deary , that I must have shocked you by all the
wicked things I’ve been sayin’  about the dead, and such like, for
weeks past; but I didn’ t mean them, and I want ye to remember that
when I’m gone. We aud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft
the krok-hooal, don’t altogether like to think of it, and we don’t want
to feel scart of it; an’ that’s why I’ve took to makin’  light of it, so that
I’d cheer up my own heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain’t
afraid of dyin’, not a bit; only I don’t want to die if I can help it. My
time must be nigh at hand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is
too much for any man to expect; and I’m so nigh it that the Aud Man
is already whettin’  his scythe. Ye see, I can’t get out o’ the habit of
caffin’ about it all at once; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the Angel of Death will sound his trumpet for me. But don’t ye dooal an’ greet, my deary!”—for he saw that I was
crying—“if he should come this very night I’d not refuse to answer
his call. For life be, after all, only a waitin’  for somethin’  else than
what we’re doin’; and death be all that we can rightly depend on. But
I’m content, for it’s comin’  to me, my deary , and comin’  quick. It
may be comin’ while  we be lookin’  and wonderin’. Maybe it’s in that
wind out over the sea that’s bringin’  with it loss and wreck, and sore
distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!” he cried suddenly . “There’ s
something in that wind and in the hoast beyont that sounds, and
looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It’s in the air; I feel it
comin’. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call comes!” He
held up his arms devoutly , and raised his hat. His mouth moved as
though he were praying. After a few minutes’  silence, he got up,
shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and
hobbled of f. It all touched me, and upset me very much. I was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass
under his arm. He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all
the time kept looking at a strange ship. “I can’t make her out,” he said; “she’ s a Russian, by the look of
her; but she’s knocking about in the queerest way. She doesn’ t know6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

CUTTING FROM “THE DAILYGRAPH,” 8 AUGUST
(Pasted in Mina Murray’ s Journal. )
From a Correspondent.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Whitby . ONE of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been
experienced here, with results both stran ge and unique. The weather
had been somewhat  sultry , but not to any degree uncommon in the
month of August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known,
and the great body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to
Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hood’ s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes,
and the various trips in the neighbourho od of Whitby . The steamers
Emma  and Scarbor ough  made trips up and down the coast, and there
was an unusual amount of “tripping” both to and from Whitby . The
day was unusually fine till the afternoo n, when some of the gossips
who frequent the East Cliff churchyard, and from that commanding
eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east,
called attention to a sudden show of “mares’-tails” high in the sky to
the north-west. The wind was then blowing from the south-west in
the mild degree which in barometrical language is ranked “No. 2:
light breeze.” The coastguard on duty at once made report, and one
old fisherman, who for more than half a century has kept watch on
weather signs from the East Cliff, foreto ld in an emphatic manner the
coming of a sudde n storm. The approach of sunset was so very
beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that
there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old
churchyard to enjoy the beauty . Befor e the sun dipped below the
black mass of Kettleness, standing boldl y athwart the western sky, its
downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour
—flame, purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with
here and there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness,
in all sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The
experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the
sketches of the “Prelude to the Great Storm” will grace the R. A.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

"walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind
then and there that his “cobble” or his “mule,” as they term the
different classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm
had passed . The wind fell away entirel y during the evening, and at
midnight there was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing
intensity which, on the approach of thunder , affects persons of a
sensitive nature. There were but few lights in sight at sea, for even
the coasting steamers, which usually “hug” the shore so closely , kept
well to seaward, and but few fishing-boats were in sight. The only
sail notice able was a foreign schooner with all sails set, which was
seemingly going westwards. The foolhardiness or ignorance of her
officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in
sight, and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sail in face of her6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 61/291danger . Before the night shut down she was seen with sails idly
flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea,
“As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.”
Shortly before ten o’clock the stillness of the air grew quite
oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a
sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard,
and the band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord
in the great harmony  of nature’ s silence. A little after midnight came
a strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to
carry a strange, faint, hollow booming. Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at
the time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to
realize, the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The
waves rose in growing fury, each overto pping its fellow , till in a very
few minutes the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring
monster . White-cres ted waves beat madly on the level sands and
rushed up the shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with
their spume swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from
the end of either pier of Whitby Harbour . The wind roared like
thunder , and blew with such force that it was with difficulty that
even strong men kept their feet, or clung with grim clasp to the iron
stanchions. It was found necessary to clear the entire piers from the
mass of onlookers, or else the fatalities of the night would have been
increased manifold. To add to the difficulties and dangers of the
time, masses of sea-fog came drifting inland—white, wet clouds,
which swept by in ghostly fashion, so dank and damp and cold that it
needed but little effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those
lost at sea were touching their living brethren with the clammy hands
of death, and many a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept
by. At times the mist cleared, and the sea for some distance could be
seen in the glare of the lightning, whic h now came thick and fast,
followed by such sudden peals of thunder that the whole sky
overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the
storm. Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur
and of absorbing interest—the sea, running mountains high, threw
skywards with each wave mighty mass es of white foam, which the
tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space; here and
there a fishing-boat, with a rag of sail, running madly for shelter
before the blast; now and again the white wings of a storm-tossed
sea-bird. On the summit of the East Cliff the new searchlight was
ready for experiment, but had not yet been tried. The officers in
charge of it got it into working order , and in the pauses of the
inrushing mist swept with it the surface  of the sea. Once or twice its
service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat, with gunwale
under water , rushed into the harbour , able, by the guidance of the
sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers. As
each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy
from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment
seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush. Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a
schooner with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 62/291been notic ed earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time
backed to the east, and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on
the cliff as they realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many
good ships have from time to time suffered, and, with the wind
blowing from its present quarter , it would be quite impossible that
she should fetch the entrance of the harbour . It was now nearly the
hour of high tide, but the waves were so great that in their troughs
the shallows of the shore were almost visible, and the schooner , with
all sails set, was rushing with such speed that, in the words of one
old salt, “she must fetch up somewhere, if it was only in hell.” Then
came another rush of sea-fog, greater than any hitherto—a mass of
dank mist,  which seemed to close on all things like a grey pall, and
left available to men only the organ of hearing, for the roar of the
tempest, and the crash of the thunder , and the booming of the mighty
billows came throu gh the damp oblivi on even louder than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth
across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited
breathless. The wind suddenly shifted  to the north-east, and the
remnant of the sea-f og melted in the blast; and then, mirabile dictu,
between the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at
headlong speed, swept the strange schoo ner before the blast, with all
sail set, and gaine d the safety of the harbour . The searchlight
followed her, and a shudder ran through  all who saw her, for lashed
to the helm was a corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly
to and fro at each motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on
deck at all. A great awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as
if by a miracle, had found the harbour , unsteered save by the hand of
a dead man! However , all took place more quickly than it takes to
write these words. The schooner paused not, but rushing across the
harbour , pitched herself on that accum ulation of sand and gravel
washed by many tides and many storms into the south-east corner of
the pier jutting under the East Clif f, known locally as Tate Hill Pier . There was of course  a considerable concussion as the vessel drove
up on the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and
some of the “top-ham mer” came crashing down. But, strangest of all,
the very instant the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on
deck from below , as if shot up by the concussion, and running
forward, jumped from the bow on the sand. Making straight for the
steep cliff, where the churchyard hangs over the laneway to the East
Pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstones—“thruf f-steans” or
“through-stones,” as they call them in the Whitby vernacular—
actually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away , it
disappeared in the darkness, which seemed intensified just beyond
the focus of the searchlight. It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill
Pier, as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in
bed or were out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty
on the eastern side of the harbour , who at once ran down to the little
pier, was the first to climb on board. The men working the
searchlight, after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing
anything, then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there. The
coastguard ran aft, and when he came beside the wheel, bent over to
examine it, and recoiled at once as though under some sudden6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 63/291emotion. This seemed to pique general curiosity , and quite a number
of people began to run. It is a good way round from the West Cliff by
the Drawb ridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your correspondent is a fairly
good runner , and came well ahead of the crowd. When I arrived,
however , I found already assembled on the pier a crowd, whom the
coastguard and police refused to allow  to come on board. By the
courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent,
permitted to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw
the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel. It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed,
for not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply
fastened by his hands, tied one over the other , to a spoke of the
wheel. Between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set
of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and
wheel, and all kept fast by the binding cords. The poor fellow may
have been  seated at one time, but the flapping and buffeting of the
sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and dragged him to
and fro, so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the flesh to
the bone. Accurate note was made of the state of things, and a doctor
—Sur geon J.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot Place—who came
immediately after me, declared, after making examination, that the
man must have been dead for quite two days. In his pocket was a
bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of paper , which
proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said the man
must have  tied up his own hands, fasten ing the knots with his teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some
complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards
cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian
entering on a derelict. Already , however , the legal tongues are
wagging, and one young law student is loudly asserting that the
rights of the owner are already completely sacrificed, his property
being held in contravention of the statutes of mortmain, since the
tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of delegated possession, is held in
a dead hand . It is need less to say that the dead steersman has been
reverently removed from the place where he held his honourable
watch and ward till death—a steadfast ness as noble as that of the
young Casabianca—and placed in the mortuary to await inquest. Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;
crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden
over the Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue,
further details of the derelict ship which found her way so
miraculously into harbour in the storm. Whitby
9 August.—The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the
storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It turns
out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the
Demeter . She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a
small amount of cargo—a number of great wooden boxes filled with
mould. This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor , Mr. S.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"F. Billington, of 7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and
formally took possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian
consul, too, acting for the charter -party , took formal possession of
the ship, and paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

Trade have been most exacting in seeing that every compliance has
been made  with existing regulations. As the matter is to be a “nine
days’  wonder,” they are evidently deter mined that there shall be no
cause of after complaint. A good deal of interest was abroad
concerning the dog which landed when the ship struck, and more
than a few of the members of the S. P.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"C. A., which is very strong in
Whitby , have tried to befriend the animal. To the general
disappointment, however, it was not to be found; it seems to have
disappeared entirely  from the town. It may be that it was frightened
and made its way on to the moors, where it is still hiding in terror . There are some who look with dread on such a possibility , lest later
on it should in itself become a danger , for it is evidently a fierce
brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred mastif f belonging
to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found dead in the
roadway opposite to its master ’s yard. It had been fighting, and
manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away ,
and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw . Later .—By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector , I have
been permitted to look over the log-book of the Demeter , which was
in order up to within three days, but contained nothing of special
interest except as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest,
however , is with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was
to-day produced at the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the
two between them unfold it has not been my lot to come across. As
there is no motive for concealment, I am permitted to use them, and
accordingly send you a rescript, simply  omitting technical details of
seamanship and supercar go. It almost seems as though the captain
had been seized with some kind of mani a before he had got well into
blue water , and that this had developed  persistently throughout the
voyage. Of course my statement must be taken cum grano , since I
am writing from the dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who
kindly translated for me, time being short. LOG OF THE “DEMETER.”

something.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Seemed scared, but would not speak out. On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew . Men all steady
fellows, who sailed with me before. Mate could not make out what
was wron g; they only told him there was something , and crossed
themselves. Mate lost temper with one of them that day and struck
him. Expected fierce quarrel, but all was quiet. On 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of crew ,
Petrofsky , was missing. Could not account for it. Took larboard
watch eight bells last night; was relieved  by Abramof f, but did not go
to bunk. Men more downcast than ever. All said they expected
something of the kind, but would not say more than there was
something  aboard. Mate getting very impatient with them; feared
some trouble ahead. On 17 July, yesterda y, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin,
and in an awestruck  way confided to me that he thought there was a
strange man aboard the ship. He said that in his watch he had been
sheltering behind the deck-house, as there was a rain-storm, when he
saw a tall, thin man, who was not like any of the crew , come up the
companion-way , and go along the deck  forward, and disappear . He
followed cautiously , but when he got to bows found no one, and the
hatchways were all closed. He was in a panic of superstitious fear,
and I am afraid the panic may spread. To allay it, I shall to-day
search entire ship carefully from stem to stern. Later in the day I got together the whole crew , and told them, as
they evide ntly thought there was some one in the ship, we would
search from stem to stern. First mate angry; said it was folly, and to
yield to such foolish ideas would demor alise the men; said he would
engage to keep them out of trouble with a handspike. I let him take
the helm, while the rest began thorough  search, all keeping abreast,
with lanterns: we left no corner unsearched. As there were only the
big wooden boxes, there were no odd corners where a man could
hide. Men much relieved when search over, and went back to work
cheerfully . First mate scowled, but said nothing. 22 July.—Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with
sails—no time to be frightened. Men seem to have forgotten their
dread. Mate cheerful again, and all on good terms. Praised men for
work in bad weather . Passed Gibralter and out through Straits. All
well. 24 July.—There seems some doom over this ship. Already a hand
short, and entering on the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead,
and yet last night another man lost—disappeared. Like the first, he
came off his watch and was not seen again. Men all in a panic of
fear; sent a round robin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 66/291be alone. Mate angry . Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or
the men will do some violence. 28 July.—Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of
maelstrom, and the wind a tempest. No sleep for any one.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Men all
worn out. Hardly know how to set a watch, since no one fit to go on. Second mate volunteered to steer and watch, and let men snatch a
few hours ’ sleep. Wind abating; seas still terrific, but feel them less,
as ship is steadier . 29 July.—Another tragedy . Had single watch to-night, as crew too
tired to double. When morning watch came on deck could find no
one except steersman. Raised outcry , and all came on deck. Thorough search, but no one found. Are now without second mate,
and crew in a panic. Mate and I agreed to go armed henceforth and
wait for any sign of cause. 30 July.—Last night. Rejoiced we are nearing England. Weather
fine, all sails set. Retired worn out; slept soundly; awaked by mate
telling me that both man of watch and steersman missing. Only self
and mate and two hands left to work ship. 1 August .—Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted. Had hoped
when in the English Channel to be able to signal for help or get in
somewhere. Not having power to work sails, have to run before
wind. Dare not lower , as could not raise  them again. We seem to be
drifting to some terrible doom. Mate now more demoralised than
either of men. His stronger nature seem s to have worked inwardly
against himself. Men are beyond fear, working stolidly and patiently ,
with minds made up to worst. They are Russian, he Roumanian. 2 August, midnight .—W oke up from few minutes’  sleep by
hearing a cry, seemingly outside my port. Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, and ran against mate. Tells me heard cry and ran,
but no sign of man on watch. One more gone.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Lord, help us! Mate
says we must be past Straits of Dover , as in a moment of fog lifting
he saw North Forela nd, just as he heard the man cry out. If so we are
now off in the North Sea, and only God can guide us in the fog,
which seems to move with us; and God seems to have deserted us. 3 August.—At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel,
and when I got to it found no one there. The wind was steady , and as
we ran before it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted
for the mate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his
flannels. He looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his
reason has given way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely ,
with his mouth to my ear, as though fearing the very air might hear:
“It is here; I know it, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a
man, tall and thin, and ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking
out. I crept behind It, and gave It my knife; but the knife went
through It, empty as the air.” And as he spoke he took his knife and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 67/291drove it savagely into space. Then he went on: “But It is here, and
I’ll find It. It is in the hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I’ll
unscrew them one by one and see. You work the helm.” And, with a
warning look and his finger on his lip, he went below . There was
springing up a chop py wind, and I could not leave the helm. I saw
him come  out on deck again with a tool-chest and a lantern, and go
down the forward hatchway . He is mad, stark, raving mad, and it’s
no use my trying to stop him. He can’t hurt those big boxes: they are
invoiced as “clay ,” and to pull them about is as harmless a thing as
he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and write these notes.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I
can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears. Then, if I can’t steer
to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut down sails and lie by,
and signal for help.... It is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the
mate would come out calmer—for I heard him knocking away at
something in the hold, and work is good for him—there came up the
hatchway a sudden, startled scream, which made my blood run cold,
and up on the deck he came as if shot from a gun—a raging
madman, with his eyes rolling and his face convulsed with fear. “Save me! save me!” he cried, and then looked round on the blanket
of fog. His horror turned to despair , and in a steady voice he said:
“You had better come too, captain, before it is too late. He is there. I

that is left!” Before I could say a word, or move forward to seize
him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately threw himself into
the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was this madman
who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has followed
them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all these
horrors when I get to port? When  I get to port!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

and up the abbey steps; for he is to be buried in the churchyard on
the cliff. The owners of more than a hundred boats have already
given in their names as wishing to follow him to the grave. No trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is
much mourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he
would, I believe, be adopted by the town. To-morrow will see the
funeral; and so will end this one more “mystery of the sea.”
Mina Murray’ s Journal. 8 August.—Lucy was very restless all night, and I, too, could not
sleep. The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the
chimney-pots, it made me shudder . When a sharp puff came it
seemed to be like a distant gun. Strangely enough, Lucy did not
wake; but she got up twice and dressed herself. Fortunately , each
time I awoke in time and managed to undress her without waking
her, and got her back to bed. It is a very strange thing, this sleep-
walking, for as soon  as her will is thwa rted in any physical way, her
intention, if there be any, disappears, and she yields herself almost
exactly to the routine of her life. Early in the morning  we both got up and went down to the harbour
to see if anything had happened in the night.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"There were very few
people about, and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and
fresh, the big, grim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves
because the foam that topped them was like snow , forced themselves
in through  the narrow mouth of the harbour—like a bullying man
going through a crowd. Somehow I felt glad that Jonathan was not
on the sea last night, but on land. But, oh, is he on land or sea? Where is he, and how? I am getting fearfully anxious about him. If I
only knew what to do, and could do anything!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"10 August. —The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most
touching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the
coffin was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to
the churchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old
seat, whils t the cortège of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and
came down again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession
nearly all the way. The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our
seat so that we stood on it when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset. She was restless and uneasy all the
time, and I cannot but think that her dreaming at night is telling on
her. She is quite odd in one thing: she will not admit to me that there
is any cause for restlessness; or if there be, she does not understand it
herself. There is an additional cause in that poor old Mr.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Swales was
found dead this morning on our seat, his neck being broken. He had
evidently , as the doctor said, fallen back in the seat in some sort of
fright, for there was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men
said made them shudder. Poor dear old man!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Perhaps he had seen
Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she
feels influences more acutely than other people do. Just now she was
quite upset by a little thing which I did not much heed, though I am
myself very fond of animals. One of the men who came up here
often to look for the boats was followed by his dog. The dog is6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 69/291always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw the
man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would
not come to its master , who was on the seat with us, but kept a few
yards off, barking and howling. Its maste r spoke to it gently , and then
harshly , and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to
make a noise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its
hairs bristling out like a cat’s tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally the man, too, got angry , and jumped down and kicked the
dog, and then took it by the scruf f of the neck and half dragged and
half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The
moment it touched the stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all
into a tremble. It did not try to get away , but crouched down,
quivering and cowering, and was in such a pitiable state of terror that
I tried, though without effect, to comfort it. Lucy was full of pity,
too, but she did not attempt to touch the dog, but looked at it in an
agonised sort of way. I greatly fear that she is of too super -sensitive a
nature to go through the world without trouble. She will be dreaming
of this to-night, I am sure. The whole agglomeration of things—the
ship steered into port by a dead man; his attitude, tied to the wheel
with a crucifix and beads; the touching funeral; the dog, now furious
and now in terror—will all af ford material for her dreams. I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically , so I
shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood’ s Bay and
back. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

MINA MURRAY’S JOURNAL
Same day, 11 o’cloc k p. m.—Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that
I had made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night. We had a
lovely walk. Lucy , after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to
some dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the
lighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot
everything except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the
slate clean and give us a fresh start. We had a capital “severe tea” at
Robin Hood’s Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-
window right over the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe
we should have shocked the “New Woman” with our appetites. Men
are more tolerant, bless them! Then we walked home with some, or
rather many , stoppages to rest, and with our hearts full of a constant
dread of wild bulls. Lucy was really tired, and we intended to creep
off to bed as soon as we could. The young curate came in, however ,
and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay for supper . Lucy and I had both
a fight for it with the dusty miller; I know it was a hard fight on my
part, and I am quite heroic. I think that some day the bishops must
get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates, who
don’t take supper , no matter how they may be pressed to, and who
will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and breathing softly . She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and looks, oh, so
sweet. If Mr. Holmw ood fell in love with her seeing her only in the
drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now. Some
of the “New Women” writers will some day start an idea that men
and wom en should be allowed to see each other asleep before
proposing or accepting. But I suppo se the New Woman won’ t
condescend in future to accept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will make of it, too!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"There’ s some consolation in
that. I am so happy to-night, because dear Lucy seems better . I really
believe she has turned the corner , and that we are over her troubles
with dream ing. I should be quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.... God bless and keep him. 11 August , 3 a. m.—Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well
write. I am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure,
such an agonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed
my diary .... Suddenly I became broad  awake, and sat up, with a
horrible sense of fear upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness
around me. The room  was dark, so I could not see Lucy’ s bed; I stole
across and felt for her. The bed was empty . I lit a match and found
that she was not in the room. The door was shut, but not locked, as I
had left it. I feared to wake her mother , who has been more than
usually ill lately , so threw on some clothes and got ready to look for
her. As I was leaving  the room it struck me that the clothes she wore
might give me some clue to her dreaming intention. Dressing-gown
would mean house; dress, outside. Dressing-gown and dress were6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 71/291both in their places. “Thank God,” I said to myself, “she cannot be
far, as she is only in her nightdress.” I ran downstairs and looked in
the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in all the other open
rooms of the house , with an ever-growing fear chilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It was not wide
open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people of the
house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that Lucy
must have  gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what
might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I
took a big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I
was in the Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the
North Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I
expected. At the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across
the harbou r to the East Cliff, in the hope or fear—I don’t know
which—of seeing Lucy in our favourite  seat. There was a bright full
moon, with heavy black, driving clouds, which threw the whole
scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see nothing, as the shadow of a cloud
obscured St. Mary’ s Church and all around it. Then as the cloud
passed I could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view; and as
the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword-cut moved
along, the church and the churchyard became gradually visible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for there, on
our favour ite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a half-reclining
figure, snowy white . The coming of the cloud was too quick for me
to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost immediately; but
it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat
where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was, whether
man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another glance,
but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the fish-
market to the bridge , which was the only way to reach the East Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced that it
was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy’ s condition. The time
and distan ce seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath
came laboured as I toiled up the endles s steps to the abbey . I must
have gone  fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted
with lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty . When I
got almost  to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I
was now close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of
shadow . There was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending
over the half-reclining white figure. I called in fright, “Lucy! Lucy!”
and somet hing raise d a head, and from where I was I could see a
white face and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer , and I ran on
to the entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was
between me and the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in view  again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight
struck so brilliantly that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head
lying over the back of the seat. She was quite alone, and there was
not a sign of any living thing about. When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips
were parted, and she was breathing—not softly as usual with her, but
in long, heavy gasps , as though striving  to get her lungs full at every
breath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled
the collar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 72/291there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I
flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her
neck, for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the
night air, unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in
order to have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the
shawl at her throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been
clumsy in my anxiety and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-
by, when her breathing became quieter , she put her hand to her throat
again and moaned. When I had her carefully wrapped up I put my
shoes on her feet and then began very gently to wake her. At first she
did not respond; but gradually she becam e more and more uneasy in
her sleep,  moaning and sighing occasi onally . At last, as time was
passing fast, and, for many other reasons, I wished to get her home at
once, I shook her more forcibly , till finally she opened her eyes and
awoke. She did not seem surprised to see me, as, of course, she did
not realise all at once where she was. Lucy always wakes prettily ,
and even at such a time, when her body  must have been chilled with
cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking unclad in a
churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She trembled a little,
and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with me home she
rose witho ut a word, with the obedien ce of a child. As we passed
along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She
stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would
not. However , when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard,
where there was a puddle of water , remaining from the storm, I
daubed my feet with mud, using each foot in turn on the other , so
that as we went home, no one, in case we should meet any one,
should notice my bare feet. Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw a man, who seemed not quite sober , passing along a
street in front of us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up
an opening such as there are here, steep little closes, or “wynds,” as
they call them in Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that
sometimes I thought I should faint. I was filled with anxiety about
Lucy , not only for her health, lest she should suffer from the
exposure, but for her reputation in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our feet, and had said a prayer of
thankfulness together , I tucked her into bed. Before falling asleep she
asked—even implored—me not to say a word to any one, even her
mother , about her sleep-walking adventure. I hesitated at first to
promise; but on thinking of the state of her mother ’s health, and how
the knowledge of such a thing would fret her, and thinking, too, of
how such a story might become distorted—nay , infallibly would—in
case it should leak out, I thought it wiser  to do so. I hope I did right. I
have locked the door, and the key is tied to my wrist, so perhaps I
shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping soundly; the reflex of
the dawn is high and far over the sea.... Same day, noon. —All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and
seemed not to have  even changed her side. The adventure of the
night does not seem to have harmed her; on the contrary , it has
benefited her, for she looks better this morning than she has done for
weeks. I was sorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 73/291hurt her. Indeed, it might have been serious, for the skin of her throat
was pierced. I must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have
transfixed it, for there are two little red points like pin-pricks, and on
the band of her nightdress was a drop of blood. When I apologised
and was concerned about it, she laughed  and petted me, and said she
did not even feel it. Fortunately it cannot leave a scar , as it is so tiny . Same day, night.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"—We passed a happy day. The air was clear , and
the sun bright, and there was a cool breeze. We took our lunch to
Mulgrave Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving  by the road and Lucy and I
walking by the cliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad
myself, for I could not but feel how absolutely  happy it would have
been had Jonathan been with me. But there!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I must only be patient. In the evening we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some
good music by Spohr and Mackenzie, and went to bed early . Lucy
seems more restful than she has been for some time, and fell asleep
at once. I shall lock the door and secure the key the same as before,
though I do not expect any trouble to-night. 12 August. —My expectations were wrong, for twice during the
night I was wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in
her sleep, to be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went
back to bed under a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard
the birds chirping outside of the window . Lucy woke, too, and, I was
glad to see, was even better than on the previous morning. All her
old gaiety of manne r seemed to have come back, and she came and
snuggled in beside me and told me all about Arthur . I told her how
anxious I was about Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded somewhat, for, though sympathy can’t alter
facts, it can help to make them more bearable. 13 August .—Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my
wrist as before. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting
up in bed, still asleep, pointing to the window . I got up quietly , and
pulling aside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the
soft effect of the light over the sea and sky—mer ged together in one
great, silent mystery—was beautiful beyond words. Between me and
the moonl ight flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling
circles. Once or twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose,
frightened at seeing me, and flitted away across the harbour towards
the abbey. When I came back from the window Lucy had lain down
again, and was sleeping peacefully . She did not stir again all night. 14 August .—On the East Cliff, reading and writin g all day. Lucy
seems to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is
hard to get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch
or tea or dinner . This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were
coming home for dinner , and had come to the top of the steps up
from the West Pier and stopped to look at the view , as we generally
do. The setting sun, low down in the sky, was just dropping behind
Kettleness; the red light was thrown over on the East Cliff and the
old abbey , and seem ed to bathe everyth ing in a beautiful rosy glow .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 74/291We were silent for a while, and suddenly Lucy murmured as if to
herself:—
“His red eyes again! They are just the same.” It was such an odd
expression, coming apropos  of nothing, that it quite startled me. I
slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare
at her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look
on her face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but
followed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat,
whereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself,
for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like
burning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red
sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary’ s Church behind
our seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the
refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I
called Lucy’s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself
with a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that
she was thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it;
so I said nothing, and we went home to dinner . Lucy had a headache
and went early to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll
myself; I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of
sweet sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home—
it was then bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our
part of the Crescent was in shadow , everything could be well seen—I
threw a glance up at our window , and saw Lucy’ s head leaning out. I
thought that perhap s she was looking out for me, so I opened my
handkerchief and waved it. She did not notice or make any
movement whatever . Just then, the moonlight crept round an angle of
the building, and the light fell on the window . There distinctly was
Lucy with her head lying up against the side of the window-sill and
her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and by her, seated on the window-
sill, was something that looked like a good-sized bird. I was afraid
she might  get a chill, so I ran upstairs, but as I came into the room
she was moving back to her bed, fast asleep, and breathing heavily;
she was holding her hand to her throat, as though to protect it from
cold. I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care
that the door is locked and the window securely fastened. She looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont,
and there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not
like. I fear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out
what it is. 15 August. —Rose later than usual. Lucy was languid and tired,
and slept on after we had been called. We had a happy surprise at
breakfast. Arthur ’s father is better , and wants the marriage to come
off soon. Lucy is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at
once. Later on in the day she told me the cause. She is grieved to
lose Lucy as her very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to
have some one to protect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to
me that she has got her death-warrant. She has not told Lucy , and
made me promise secrecy; her doctor told her that within a few
months, at most, she must die, for her heart is weakening. At any
time, even now, a sudden shock would be almost sure to kill her. Ah,6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

Lucy’ s sleep-walking. 17 August.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"—No diary for two whole days. I have not had the heart
to write. Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our
happiness. No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing
weaker , whilst her mother ’s hours are numbering to a close. I do not
understand Lucy’ s fading away as she is doing. She eats well and
sleeps well, and enjoys the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her
cheeks are fading, and she gets weaker and more languid day by day;
at night I hear her gasping as if for air. I keep the key of our door
always fastened to my wrist at night, but she gets up and walks about
the room, and sits at the open window . Last night I found her leaning
out when I woke up, and when I tried to wake her I could not; she
was in a faint. When I managed to restore her she was as weak as
water , and cried silently between long, painful struggles for breath. When I asked her how she came to be at the window she shook her
head and turned away. I trust her feeling ill may not be from that
unlucky prick of the safety-pin. I looked at her throat just now as she
lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed. They are
still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the edges of them
are faintly white. They are like little white dots with red centres. Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the doctor
seeing about them. Letter , Samuel F .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

Mina Murray’ s Journal. 18 August. —I am happy to-day , and write sitting on the seat in the
churchyard. Lucy is ever so much better . Last night she slept well all
night, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back
already to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she were in any way anæmic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in gay spirits  and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid
reticence seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded
me, as if I needed any reminding, of that night, and that it was here,
on this very seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped
playfully with the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:—
“My poor little feet didn’ t make much noise then! I daresay poor
old Mr. Swales would have told me that it was because I didn’ t want
to wake up Geordie. ” As she was in such a communicative humour , I
asked her if she had dreamed at all that night. Before she answered,
that sweet, puckered look came into her forehead, which Arthur—I
call him Arthur from  her habit—says he loves; and, indeed, I don’t
wonder that he does. Then she went on in a half-dreaming kind of
way, as if trying to recall it to herself:—
“I didn’ t quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to
be here in this spot—I don’t know why, for I was afraid of something
—I don’t know what. I remember , though I suppose I was asleep,
passing through the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I
went by, and I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs
howling—the whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all
howling at once—as I went up the steps . Then I had a vague memory
of something long and dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the
sunset, and something very sweet and very bitter all around me at
once; and then I seem ed sinking into deep green water , and there was
a singing in my ears, as I have heard there is to drowning men; and
then every thing seemed passing away from me; my soul seemed to
go out from  my body and float about the air. I seem to remember that
once the West Lighthouse was right under me, and then there was a
sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an earthquake, and I came
back and found you shaking my body . I saw you do it before I felt
you.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

listened to her breathlessly . I did not quite like it, and thought it
better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other
subjects, and Lucy was like her old self again. When we got home
the fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really
more rosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a
very happy evening together . 19 August. —Joy , joy, joy! although not all joy. At last, news of
Jonathan. The dear fellow has been ill; that is why he did not write. I
am not afraid to think it or say it, now that I know . Mr. Hawkins sent
me on the letter , and wrote himself, oh, so kindly . I am to leave in the
morning and go over to Jonathan, and to help to nurse him if
necessary , and to bring him home. Mr. Hawkins says it would not be
a bad thing if we were to be married out there. I have cried over the
good Sister ’s letter till I can feel it wet against my bosom, where it
lies. It is of Jonatha n, and must be next my heart, for he is in my
heart. My journey is all mapped out, and my luggage ready . I am

more; I must keep it to say to Jonathan, my husband. The letter that
he has seen and touched must comfort me till we meet. Letter , Sister Agatha, Hospital of St. Joseph and Ste. Mary , Buda-

“I write by desire of Mr. Jonathan Harker, who is himself not
strong enough to write, though progressing well, thanks to God and
St. Joseph  and Ste. Mary . He has been under our care for nearly six
weeks, suffering from a violent brain fever . He wishes me to convey
his love, and to say that by this post I write for him to Mr. Peter
Hawkins, Exeter , to say, with his dutiful  respects, that he is sorry for
his delay , and that all of his work is completed. He will require some
few weeks’  rest in our sanatorium in the hills, but will then return. He wishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him, and
that he would like to pay for his staying here, so that others who
need shall not be wanting for help. “Believe me,

fearful shock—so says our doctor—and in his delirium his ravings
have been  dreadful;  of wolves and poison and blood; of ghosts and
demons; and I fear to say of what. Be careful with him always that
there may be nothin g to excite him of this kind for a long time to

should have written long ago, but we knew nothing of his friends,

English, they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the way
thither that the train reached. “Be assured that he is well cared for. He has won all hearts by his
sweetness and gentleness. He is truly getting on well, and I have no
doubt will in a few weeks be all himself. But be careful of him for
safety’ s sake. There  are, I pray God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary ,
many , many , happy years for you both.”
Dr. Sewar d’s Diary .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"19 August. —Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. About eight o’clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog
does when setting. The attendant was struck by his manner , and
knowing my interest in him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually
respectful to the attendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man
tells me, he was quite haughty . Would not condescend to talk with
him at all. All he would say was:—
“I don’t want to talk to you: you don’t count now; the Master is at
hand.”
The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania
which has seized him. If so, we must  look out for squalls, for a
strong man with homicidal and religious mania at once might be
dangerous. The combination is a dreadful one.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"At nine o’clock I
visited him myself. His attitude to me was the same as that to the
attendant; in his sublime self-feeling the difference between myself
and attend ant seemed to him as nothing. It looks like religious
mania, and he will soon think that he himself is God. These
infinitesimal distinc tions between man and man are too paltry for an
Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselves away! The
real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created from
human vanity sees no difference betwe en an eagle and a sparrow . Oh, if men only knew! For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater
and greater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept
strict observation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into
his eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea,
and with it the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum
attendants come to know so well. He became quite quiet, and went
and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly , and looked into space with
lack-lustre eyes. I thought I would find out if his apathy were real or
only assumed, and tried to lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which
had never failed to excite his attention. At first he made no reply , but
at length said testily:—
“Bother them all!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I don’ t care a pin about them.”
“What?” I said. “You don’t mean to tell me you don’t care about
spiders?” (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is
filling up with columns of small figures.) To this he answered
enigmatically:—
“The bride -maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the
bride; but when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to
the eyes that are filled.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

his bed all the time I remained with him. I am wear y to-night and low in spirits. I cannot but think of Lucy ,
and how different things might have been. If I don’t sleep at once,
chloral, the modern Morpheus—C 2HCl 3O. H2O! I must be careful
not to let it grow into a habit. No, I shall take none to-night! I have
thought of Lucy , and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two. If
need be, to-night shall be sleepless.... Later .—Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had
lain tossin g about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when
the night-watchman  came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that
Renfield had escape d. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once;
my patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those
ideas of his migh t work out dange rously with strangers. The
attendant was waiting for me. He said he had seen him not ten
minutes before, seemingly asleep in his bed, when he had looked
through the observation-trap in the door. His attention was called by
the sound of the window being wrenched out. He ran back and saw
his feet disappear through the window , and had at once sent up for
me. He was only in his night-gear , and cannot be far off. The
attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should
go than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting
out of the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn’ t get
through the window . I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet
foremost, and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed
unhurt. The attenda nt told me the patient had gone to the left, and
had taken a straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got
through the belt of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall
which separates our grounds from those of the deserted house. I ran back at once, told the watchman  to get three or four men
immediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our
friend might be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the
wall, dropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield’ s figure
just disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On the far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old
ironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to
some one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was
saying, lest I might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an
errant swarm of bees is nothing to follo wing a naked lunatic, when
the fit of escaping is upon him! After a few minutes, however , I
could see that he did not take note of anything around him, and so
ventured to draw nearer to him—the more so as my men had now
crossed the wall and were closing him in. I heard him say:—
“I am here to do Your bidding, Master . I am Your slave, and You
will reward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long
and afar off. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and
You will not pass me by, will You, dear Master , in Your distribution
of good things?”
He is a selfish old begga r anyhow . He think s of the loaves and
fishes even when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias
make a startling combination. When we closed in on him he fought
like a tiger. He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 80/291beast than a man. I never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage
before; and I hope I shall not again. It is a mercy that we have found
out his strength and his danger in good time. With strength and
determination like his, he might have done wild work before he was
caged. He is safe now at any rate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn’ t get
free from the strait-waistcoat that keeps him restrained, and he’s
chained to the wall in the padded room. His cries are at times awful,
but the silences that follow are more deadly still, for he means
murder in every turn and movement. Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time:—
“I shall be patient, Master . It is coming—coming—coming!”
So I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but
this diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to-night.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

Letter , Mina Harker to Lucy W estenra. “Buda-Pesth, 24 August. “My dearest Lucy ,—
“I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we
parted at the railway  station at Whitby . Well, my dear, I got to Hull
all right, and caught the boat to Hambur g, and then the train on here. I feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey , except that I
knew I was coming  to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do
some nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear
one, oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has
gone out of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was
in his face has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does
not remember anything that has happened to him for a long time
past. At least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He
has had some terribl e shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if
he were to try to recall it. Sister Agatha,  who is a good creature and a
born nurse, tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off
his head. I wanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only
cross herself, and say she would never  tell; that the ravings of the
sick were the secrets  of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation
should hear them, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good
soul, and the next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up
the subject again, and after saying that she could never mention what
my poor dear raved about, added: ‘I can tell you this much, my dear:
that it was not about anything which he has done wrong himself; and
you, as his wife to be, have no cause to be concerned. He has not
forgotten you or what he owes to you. His fear was of great and
terrible things, whic h no mortal can treat of.’ I do believe the dear
soul thought I migh t be jealous lest my poor dear should have fallen
in love with any other girl. The idea of my being jealous about
Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper , I felt a thrill of joy
through me when I knew  that no other woma n was a cause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where  I can see his face while he
sleeps. He is waking!... “When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get
something from the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought
all his things. I saw that amongst them  was his note-book, and was
going to ask him to let me look at it—for I knew then that I might
find some clue to his trouble—but I suppose he must have seen my
wish in my eyes, for he sent me over to the window , saying he
wanted to be quite alone for a moment. Then he called me back, and
when I came he had his hand over the note-book, and he said to me
very solemnly:—
“‘Wilhelmina’—I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he
has never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him
—‘you know, dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife:
there shou ld be no secret, no concealment. I have had a great shock,
and when I try to think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 82/291do not know if it was all real or the dreaming of a madman. You
know I have had brain fever , and that is to be mad.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"The secret is here,
and I do not want to know it. I want to take up my life here, with our
marriage.’  For, my dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the
formalities are complete. ‘Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my
ignorance? Here is the book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will,
but never let me know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should
come upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane
or mad, recorded here.’ He fell back exhausted, and I put the book
under his pillow , and kissed him. I have asked Sister Agatha to beg
the Superior to let our wedding be this afternoon, and am waiting her
reply .... “She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English
mission church has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or
as soon after as Jonathan awakes.... “Lucy , the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very,
very happy . Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready ,
and he sat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his ‘I
will’ firml y and strongly . I could hardly  speak; my heart was so full
that even those words seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so
kind. Please God, I shall never , never forget them, nor the grave and
sweet responsibilities I have taken upon me. I must tell you of my
wedding present. When the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone
with my husband— oh, Lucy , it is the first time I have written the
words ‘my husband’—left me alone with my husband, I took the
book from  under his pillow , and wrapp ed it up in white paper , and
tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon which was round my neck,
and sealed  it over the knot with sealing-wax, and for my seal I used
my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it to my husband, and
told him that I would keep it so, and then it would be an outward and
visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each other; that I
would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake or for the
sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh, Lucy ,
it was the first time he took his wife’s hand , and said that it was the
dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go through all
the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to have said
a part of the past, but he cannot think  of time yet, and I shall not
wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the year . “Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was
the happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to
give him except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these
went my love and duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear,
when he kissed me, and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it
was like a very solemn pledge between us.... “Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only
because it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are,
very dear to me. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide
when you came from the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now, and with the eyes of a very happy wife,
whither duty has led me; so that in your own married life you too
may be all happy as I am. My dear, please Almighty God, your life6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must not wish you no pain, for that
can never be; but I do hope you will be always  as happy as I am now.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Good-bye, my dear.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

"20 August. —The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He has now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his
passion. For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then one night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept
murmuring to himself: “Now I can wait; now I can wait.” The
attendant came to tell me, so I ran down at once to have a look at
him. He was still in the strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but
the suffused look had gone from his face, and his eyes had something
of their old pleading—I might almost say, “cringing”—softness. I
was satisf ied with his present conditi on, and directed him to be
relieved. The attend ants hesitated, but finally carried out my wishes
without protest. It was a strange thing that the patient had humour
enough to see their distrust, for, coming close to me, he said in a
whisper , all the while looking furtively at them:—
“They think I could hurt you! Fancy me hurting you! The fools!”
It was soothing, somehow , to the feelings to find myself
dissociated even in the mind of this poor madman from the others;
but all the same I do not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I
have anything in common with him, so that we are, as it were, to
stand together; or has he to gain from me some good so stupendous
that my well-being is needful to him? I must find out later on.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"To-
night he will not speak. Even the offer of a kitten or even a full-6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

stock in cats. I have more to think of now, and I can wait; I can
wait.”
After a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quiet
until just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy , and at
length violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted
him so that he swooned into a sort of coma. ... Three nights has the same thing happened—violent all day then
quiet from moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could get some clue to the
cause.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

came and went.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Happy thought! We shall to-night play sane wits

shall escape with it. We shall give him a chance, and have the men
ready to follow in case they are required.... 23 August. —“The unexpected always happens.” How well
Disraeli knew life. Our bird when he found the cage open would not
fly, so all our subtle  arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we
have proved one thing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable
time. We shall in future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours
each day. I have given orders to the night attendant merely to shut
him in the padded room, when once he is quiet, until an hour before
sunrise. The poor soul’ s body will enjoy the relief even if his mind
cannot appreciate it. Hark! The unexpected again! I am called; the
patient has once more escaped. Later .—Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until the
attendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past
him and flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to
follow . Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we
found him in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me he became furious,  and had not the attendants
seized him in time, he would have tried to kill me. As we were
holding him a strange thing happened. He suddenly redoubled his
efforts, and then as suddenly grew calm. I looked round instinctively ,
but could see nothin g. Then I caught the patient’ s eye and followed
it, but could trace nothing as it looked into the moonlit sky except a
big bat, which was flapping its silent and ghostly way to the west. Bats usual ly wheel and flit about, but this one seemed to go straight
on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had some intention of its
own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and presently said:—
“You needn’ t tie me; I shall go quietly!” Without trouble we came
back to the house. I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and
shall not for get this night.... Lucy W estenra’ s Diary

lunch he looked quite grieved when he saw me, and I hadn’ t the
spirit to try to be cheerful. I wonder if I could sleep in mother ’s room
to-night. I shall make an excuse and try . 25 August .—Another bad night. Mother did not seem to take to
my propos al. She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears
to worry me. I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but
when the clock struck twelve it waked  me from a doze, so I must
have been  falling asleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at
the window , but I did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I
suppose I must then have fallen asleep . More bad dreams. I wish I
could remember them. This morning I am horribly weak. My face is
ghastly pale, and my throat pains me. It must be something wrong
with my lungs, for I don’t seem ever to get air enough. I shall try to
cheer up when Arthur comes, or else I know he will be miserable to

ourselves to be cheerful, we got, as some kind of reward for our
labours, some real cheerfulness amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra
went to lie down, and Lucy was left with me. We went into her
boudoir , and till we got there her gaiet y remained, for the servants
were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed, however ,
the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair with a
great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her high
spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to make a
diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:—
“‘I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.’  I reminded
her that a doctor ’s confidence was sacred, but that you were
grievously anxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once,
and settled  that matter in a word. ‘Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care for myself, but all for him!’  So I am quite free. “I could easily see that she is somewhat  bloodless, but I could not
see the usual anæmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to
test the quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff
a cord gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It
was a slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I
secured a few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The
qualitative analysis gives a quite norm al condition, and shows, I
should infer, in itself a vigorous state of health. In other physical
matters I was quite satisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as
there must  be a cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that
it must be something  mental. She complains of difficulty in breathing
satisfactorily at times, and of heavy , lethargic sleep, with dreams that
frighten her, but regarding which she can remember nothing. She
says that as a child she used to walk in her sleep, and that when in
Whitby the habit came back, and that once she walked out in the
night and went to East Cliff, where Miss Murray found her; but she
assures me that of late the habit has not returned. I am in doubt, and
so have done the best thing I know of; I have written to my old
friend and master , Professor Van Helsing, of Amsterdam, who knows
as much about obscu re diseases as any one in the world. I have asked
him to come over, and as you told me that all things were to be at
your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your relations
to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to your
wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for
her.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Van Helsing would, I know , do anything for me for a personal
reason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his
wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

philosopher and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced
scientists of his day; and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable
resolution, self-com mand, and toleration exalted from virtues to
blessings, and the kindliest and truest heart that beats—these form
his equipment for the noble work that he is doing for mankind—

sure.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"So I told him I would simply write  an account of our visit, just
as if I were doing a descriptive special article for The Daily
Telegraph . He seemed not to notice, but remarke d that the smuts in
London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a
student here. I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly
make it. In any case I am to have a letter . “Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I
first saw her, and certainly looked better . She had lost something of
the ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She
was very sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make
him feel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a
hard struggle for it. I believe Van Helsi ng saw it, too, for I saw the
quick look under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began
to chat of all things  except ourselves and diseases and with such an
infinite geniality that I could see poor Lucy’s pretense of animation
merge into reality . Then, without any seeming change, he brought the
conversation gently round to his visit, and suavely said:—
“‘My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you
are so much beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that
which I do not see. They told me you were down in the spirit, and
that you were of a ghastly pale. To them I say: “Pouf!”’  And he
snapped his fingers at me and went on: ‘But you and I shall show
them how wrong they are. How can he’—and he pointed at me with
the same look and gesture as that with which once he pointed me out
to his class, on, or rather after, a particu lar occasion which he never
fails to remind me of—‘know anything of a young ladies? He has his
madmans to play with, and to bring them back to happiness, and to
those that love them . It is much to do, and, oh, but there are rewards,
in that we can bestow such happiness. But the young ladies! He has
no wife nor daughter , and the young do not tell themselves to the
young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many sorrows
and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to
smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all
to ourselves.’  I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the
professor came to the window and called  me in. He looked grave, but
said: ‘I have made careful examination, but there is no functional
cause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has
been, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anæmic. I
have asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two
question, that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what
she will say. And yet there is cause;  there is always cause for
everything. I must go back home and think. You must send to me the
telegram every day; and if there be cause I shall come again. The
disease—for not to be all well is a disease—interest me, and the
sweet young dear, she interest me too. She charm me, and for her, if
not for you or disease, I come.’

alone. And so now, Art, you know all I know .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

Dr. Sewar d’s Diary .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"4 September .—Zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in
him. He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual
time. Just before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The
attendant knew the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a run, and were just in time, for at the
stroke of noon he became so violent that it took all their strength to
hold him. In about five minutes, however , he began to get more and
more quiet, and finally sank into a sort of melancholy , in which state
he has remained up to now. The attendant tells me that his screams
whilst in the paroxy sm were really appalling; I found my hands full
when I got in, attending to some of the other patients who were
frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite understand the effect, for the
sounds disturbed even me, though I was some distance away . It is
now after the dinner -hour of the asylum , and as yet my patient sits in
a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen, woe-begone look in his face,
which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly . I
cannot quite understand it. Later .—Another change in my patient. At five o’clock I looked in
on him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used
to be. He was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note
of his capture by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between
the ridges of padd ing. When he saw me, he came over and
apologised for his bad conduct, and asked me in a very humble,
cringing way to be led back to his own room and to have his note-
book again. I thought it well to humou r him: so he is back in his
room with the wind ow open. He has the sugar of his tea spread out
on the window-sill, and is reaping quite  a harvest of flies. He is not
now eatin g them, but putting them into a box, as of old, and is
already examining the corners of his room to find a spider . I tried to
get him to talk about the past few days, for any clue to his thoughts
would be of immense help to me; but he would not rise. For a
moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of far-away
voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:—
“All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now
unless I do it for myself!” Then suddenl y turning to me in a resolute
way, he said: “Doctor , won’ t you be very good to me and let me have
a little more sugar? I think it would be good for me.”
“And the flies?” I said.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"“Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like it.”
And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do
not argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a
man as, I suppose, any in the world.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I wish I could fathom his mind. Midnight. —Another change in him. I had been to see Miss
Westenra, whom I found much better , and had just returned, and was
standing at our own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I
heard him yelling. As his room is on this side of the house, I could6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 90/291hear it better than in the morning. It was a shock to me to turn from
the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid
lights and inky shadows and all the marvellous tints that come on
foul clouds even as on foul water , and to realise all the grim
sternness of my own cold stone building , with its wealth of breathing
misery , and my own desolate heart to endure it all. I reached him just
as the sun was going down, and from his window saw the red disc
sink. As it sank he became less and less frenzied; and just as it
dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an inert mass, on the
floor . It is wonderful, however , what intellectual recuperative power
lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and
looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to hold him, for I
was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight over to the
window and brushe d out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his fly-
box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut the
window , and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised
me, so I asked him: “Are you not going to keep flies any more?”
“No,” said he; “I am sick of all that rubbish!” He certainly is a
wonderfully interesting study . I wish I could get some glimpse of his
mind or of the cause  of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue
after all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high
noon and at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the
sun at periods whic h affects certain natures—as at times the moon
does others? We shall see.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

Mrs. Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy , and has
consulted me professionally about her. I took advantage of the
opportunity , and told her that my old master , Van Helsing, the great
specialist, was coming to stay with me, and that I would put her in
his charge conjointly with myself; so now we can come and go
without alarming her unduly , for a shock to her would mean sudden
death, and this, in Lucy’ s weak condition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in with difficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but,

Yours ever ,
“J    S      .”
Dr. Sewar d’s Diary . 7 September .—The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we
met at Liverpool Street was:—
“Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?”
“No,” I said. “I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss
Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.”
“Right, my friend,” he said, “quite right! Better he not know as
yet; perhaps he shall never know . I pray so; but if it be needed, then
he shall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You
deal with the madm en. All men are mad in some way or the other;
and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with
God’ s madmen, too—the rest of the world. You tell not your
madmen what you do nor why you do it; you tell them not what you
think. So you shall keep knowledge in its place, where it may rest—
where it may gathe r its kind around it and breed. You and I shall
keep as yet what we know here, and here.” He touched me on the
heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself the same way. “I
have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall unfold to you.”
“Why not now?” I asked. “It may do some good; we may arrive at
some decision.” He stopped and looked at me, and said:—
“My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has
ripened—while the milk of its mothe r-earth is in him, and the
sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the
husbandman he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands,
and blow away the green chaff, and say to you: ‘Look! he’s good
corn; he will make good crop when the time comes.’” I did not see
the application, and told him so. For reply he reached over and took6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 92/291my ear in his hand and pulled it playful ly, as he used long ago to do
at lectures , and said: “The good husbandman tell you so then because
he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the good
husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for the
children who play at husbandry , and not for those who take it as of
the work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my
corn, and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout
at all, there’s some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell.”
He broke off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went
on, and very gravely:—
“You were  always a careful student, and your case-book was ever
more full than the rest. You were only student then; now you are
master , and I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember , my
friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory , and we should not
trust the weaker . Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me
tell you that this case of our dear miss is one that may be—mind, I
say may be—of such interest to us and others that all the rest may not
make him kick the beam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of
it.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Nothing is too small. I counsel you, put down in record even your
doubts and surmise s.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see
how true you guess. We learn from failure, not from success!”
When I described Lucy’ s symptoms—the same as before, but
infinitely more marked—he looked very grave, but said nothing. He
took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs, “the
ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade,” as he once called, in
one of his lectures, the equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in, Mrs. Westen ra met us. She was alarmed,
but not nearly so much as I expected to find her. Nature in one of her
beneficent moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to
its own terrors. Here, in a case where any shock may prove fatal,
matters are so ordered that, from some cause or other , the things not
personal—even the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so
attached—do not seem to reach her. It is something like the way
Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some
insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would
otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered selfishness, then we
should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism, for
there may be deeper root for its causes than we have knowledge of. I used my knowledg e of this phase of spiritual pathology , and laid
down a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her
illness more than was absolutely required. She assented readily , so
readily that I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van
Helsing and I were shown up to Lucy’ s room. If I was shocked when
I saw her yesterday , I was horrified when I saw her to-day . She was
ghastly , chalkily pale; the red seemed to have gone even from her
lips and gums, and the bones of her face stood out prominently; her
breathing was painful to see or hear. Van Helsing’ s face grew set as
marble, and his eyeb rows conver ged till they almost touched over his
nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not seem to have strength to
speak, so for a while  we were all silent. Then Van Helsing beckoned
to me, and we went gently out of the room. The instant we had
closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to the next
door, whic h was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 93/291closed the door. “My God!” he said; “this is dreadful.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"There is no
time to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the
heart’ s action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at
once. Is it you or me?”
“I am younger and stronger , Professor . It must be me.”
“Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared.”
I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a
knock at the hall-door . When we reached the hall the maid had just
opened the door, and Arthur was steppin g quickly in. He rushed up to
me, saying in an eager whisper:—
“Jack, I was so anxio us. I read between the lines of your letter , and
have been  in an agony. The dad was better , so I ran down here to see
for myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful
to you, sir, for coming.” When first the Professor ’s eye had lit upon
him he had been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as
he took in his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young
manhood which seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to him gravely as he held out his hand:—
“Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that.” For he
suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. “You are
to help her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is
your best help.”
“What can I do?” asked Arthur hoarsely . “Tell me, and I shall do
it. My life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body
for her.” The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could
from old knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:—
“My young sir , I do not ask so much as that—not the last!”
“What shall I do?” There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril
quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
“Come!” he said.,"Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"“You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are
better than me, better than my friend John.” Arthur looked
bewildered, and the Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:
—
“Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she
must have or die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are
about to perform what we call transfusion of blood—to transfer from
full veins of one to the empty veins which pine for him. John was to
give his blood, as he is the more young and strong than me”—here
Arthur took my hand and wrung it hard in silence—“but, now you
are here, you are more good than us, old or young, who toil much in
the world of thought. Our nerves are not so calm and our blood not
so bright than yours!” Arthur turned to him and said:—
“If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would
understand——”
He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice. “Good boy!” said Van Helsing. “In the not-so-far -off you will be
happy that you have done all for her you love. Come now and be
silent. You shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must
go; and you must leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 94/291know how it is with her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of
this would be one.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Come!”
We all went up to Lucy’ s room. Arthur by direction remained
outside. Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She
was not asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her
eyes spoke  to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his
bag and laid them on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a
narcotic, and coming over to the bed, said cheerily:—
“Now , little miss, here is your medicine . Drink it off, like a good
child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes.” She had made
the ef fort with success. It astonish ed me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact,
marked the extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until
sleep bega n to flicker in her eyelids. At last, however , the narcotic
began to manifest its potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When
the Professor was satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade
him strip off his coat. Then he added: “You may take that one little
kiss while s I bring over the table. Friend John, help to me!” So
neither of us looked whilst he bent over her . Van Helsing turning to me, said:
“He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not
defibrinate it.”
Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing
performed the operation. As the transfu sion went on something like
life seeme d to come back to poor Lucy’s cheeks, and through
Arthur ’s growing pallor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to
shine. After a bit I began to grow anxious, for the loss of blood was
telling on Arthur , strong man as he was. It gave me an idea of what a
terrible strain Lucy’ s system must have under gone that what
weakened Arthur only partially restored her. But the Professor ’s face
was set, and he stood watch in hand and with his eyes fixed now on
the patien t and now on Arthur . I could hear my own heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: “Do not stir an instant.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.” When all was over I could see
how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his
arm to bring him away , when Van Helsing spoke without turning
round—the man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:—
“The brave lover , I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall
have presently .” And as he had now finished his operation, he
adjusted the pillow to the patient’ s head. As he did so the narrow
black velvet band which she seems always to wear round her throat,
buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her,
was dragged a little up, and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur
did not notice it, but I could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath
which is one of Van Helsing’ s ways of betraying emotion. He said
nothing at the moment, but turned to me, saying: “Now take down
our brave young lover , give him of the port wine, and let him lie
down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep much and eat
much, that he may be recruited of what  he has so given to his love. He must not stay here. Hold!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"a momen t. I may take it, sir, that you
are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways the
operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 95/291can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell
her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what
you have done. Good-bye.”
When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was
sleeping gently , but her breathing was stronger; I could see the
counterpane move as her breast heave d. By the bedside sat Van
Helsing, looking at her intently . The velvet band again covered the
red mark. I asked the Professor in a whisper:—
“What do you make of that mark on her throat?”
“What do you make of it?”
“I have not examined it yet,” I answered, and then and there
proceeded to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there
were two punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There
was no sign of disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking,
as if by some tritura tion. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or
whatever it was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood;
but I abandoned the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could
not be. The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with
the blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she
had before the transfusion. “Well?” said Van Helsing. “Well,” said I, “I can make nothing of it.” The Professor stood up. “I must go back to Amsterdam to-night,” he said. “There are books
and things there which I want. You must remain here all the night,
and you must not let your sight pass from her .”
“Shall I have a nurse?” I asked. “We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see
that she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep
all the night.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as
soon as possible. And then we may begin.”
“May begin?” I said. “What on earth do you mean?”
“We shall  see!” he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a
moment later and put his head inside the door and said with warning
finger held up:—
“Remember , she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall,
you shall not sleep easy hereafter!”
Dr. Sewar d’s Diary—continued. 8 September .—I sat up all night with Lucy . The opiate worked
itself off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a
different being from what she had been before the operation. Her
spirits even were good, and she was full of a happy vivacity , but I
could see evidences of the absolute prostration which she had
under gone. When I told Mrs. Westenr a that Dr. Van Helsing had
directed that I shou ld sit up with her she almost pooh-poohed the
idea, pointing out her daughter ’s renewed strength and excellent
spirits. I was firm, however , and made preparations for my long
vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the night I came in,
having in the meantime had supper , and took a seat by the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me gratefully
whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed sinking off
to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and shook6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 96/291it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort and with
shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she did not
want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:—
“You do not want to go to sleep?”
“No; I am afraid.”
“Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for .”
“Ah, not if you were like me—if sleep was to you a presage of
horror!”
“A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?”
“I don’t know; oh, I don’t know .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"And that is what is so terrible. All
this weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.”
“But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching
you, and I can promise that nothing will happen.”
“Ah, I can trust you!” I seized the opportunity , and said: “I
promise you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you
at once.”
“You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I
will sleep! ” And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief,
and sank back, asleep. All night long I watc hed by her. She never stirred, but slept on and
on in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health -giving sleep. Her lips were
slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a
pendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no
bad dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind. In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and
took myself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent
a short wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur , telling them of the
excellent result of the operation. My own work, with its manifold
arrears, took me all day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to
inquire about my zoöphagous patient. The report was good; he had
been quite quiet for the past day and night. A telegram came from
Van Helsing at Ams terdam whilst I was at dinner , suggesting that I
should be at Hillingham to-night, as it might be well to be at hand,
and stating that he was leaving by the night mail and would join me
early in the morning. 9 Septemb er.—I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to
Hillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my
brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral
exhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheer ful spirits. When she shook
hands with me she looked sharply in my face and said:—
“No sitting  up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well
again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who
will sit up with you.” I would not argue the point, but went and had
my suppe r. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming
presence, I made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of
the more than excellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and
showed me a room next her own, where a cozy fire was burning. “Now ,” she said, “you must stay here. I shall leave this door open
and my door too. You can lie on the sofa for I know that nothing
would induce any of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 97/291above the horizon. If I want anything I shall call out, and you can
come to me at once.” I could not but acquiesce, for I was “dog-
tired,” and could not have sat up had I tried. So, on her renewing her
promise to call me if she should want anything, I lay on the sofa, and
forgot all about everything. Lucy W estenra’ s Diary . 9 Septemb er.—I feel so happy to-night. I have been  so miserably
weak, that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine
after a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur
feels very, very close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about
me. I supp ose it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and
turn our inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and
strength give Love rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander
where he wills. I know where my thoug hts are.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"If Arthur only knew! My dear, my dear, your ears must tingle as you sleep, as mine do
waking. Oh, the blissful rest of last night! How I slept, with that dear,
good Dr. Seward watching me. And to-night I shall not fear to sleep,
since he is close at hand and within call. Thank everybody for being
so good to me! Thank God! Good-night, Arthur . Dr. Sewar d’s Diary . 10 September .—I was conscious of the Professor ’s hand on my
head, and started awake all in a second. That is one of the things that
we learn in an asylum, at any rate. “And how is our patient?”
“Well, when I left her , or rather when she left me,” I answered. “Come, let us see,” he said. And together we went into the room. The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently , whilst Van
Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed. As I raised  the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I
heard the Professor ’s low hiss of inspira tion, and knowing its rarity , a
deadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back,
and his exclamation of horror , “Got t in Himmel!” needed no
enforcement from his agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed
to the bed, and his iron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my
knees begin to tremble. There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy , more
horribly white and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white,
and the gums seeme d to have shrunken  back from the teeth, as we
sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing
raised his foot to stamp in anger , but the instinct of his life and all the
long years  of habit stood to him, and he put it down again softly . “Quick!” he said. “Bring the brandy .” I flew to the dining-room, and
returned with the decanter . He wetted the poor white lips with it, and
together we rubbed palm and wrist and heart. He felt her heart, and
after a few moments of agonising suspense said:—
“It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"All our work is
undone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I
have to call on you yourself this time, friend John.” As he spoke, he
was dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for
transfusion; I had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 98/291one; and so, without a moment’ s delay , we began the operation. After
a time—it did not seem a short time either , for the draining away of
one’s blood, no matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling
—Van Helsing held up a warning finger . “Do not stir,” he said, “but I
fear that with growing strength she may wake; and that would make
danger , oh, so much danger .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"But I shall precaution take. I shall give
hypodermic injection of morphia.” He proceeded then, swiftly and
deftly , to carry out his intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the
faint seemed to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a
feeling of personal pride that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal
back into the pallid cheeks and lips. No man knows, till he
experiences it, what it is to feel his own life-blood drawn away into
the veins of the woman he loves. The Professor watched me critically .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"“That will do,” he said. “Already?” I remonstrated. “You took a great deal more from Art.”
To which he smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:—
“He is her lover , her fiancé . You have work, much work, to do for
her and for others; and the present will suf fice.”
When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy , whilst I
applied digital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I
waited his leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-
and-by he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass
of wine for myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and
half whispered:—
“Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn
up unexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten
him and enjealous him, too. There must be none. So!”
When I came back he looked at me carefully , and then said:—
“You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your
sofa, and rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to
me.”
I followed  out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they
were. I had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my
strength.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the
amazement at what had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however ,
wondering over and over again how Lucy had made such a
retrograde movement, and how she could have been drained of so
much blood with no sign anywhere to show for it. I think I must have
continued my wonder in my dreams, for, sleeping and waking, my
thoughts always came back to the little punctures in her throat and
the ragged, exhausted appearance of their edges—tiny though they
were. Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly
well and strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me
in charge, with strict injunctions that I was not to leave her for a
moment. I could hear his voice in the hall, asking the way to the
nearest telegraph of fice. Lucy chatted with me freely , and seemed quite unconscious that
anything had happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any
change whatever , but said to me gratefully:—6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 99/291“We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you
really must now take care not to overwork yourself.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"You are looking
pale yourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that
you do!” As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only
momentarily , for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such
an unwonted drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor
as she turned imploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid
my finger on my lips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows. Van Helsi ng returne d in a couple of hours, and presently said to
me: “Now  you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make
yourself strong. I stay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss
myself. You and I must watch the case, and we must have none other
to know . I have grave reasons. No, do not ask them; think what you
will. Do not fear to think even the most not-probable. Good-night.”
In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either
of them might not sit up with Miss Lucy . They implored me to let
them; and when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing’ s wish that either he or
I should sit up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the
“foreign gentleman.” I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps
it is because I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on
Lucy’ s account, that their devotion was manifested; for over and
over again  have I seen similar instances of woman’ s kindness. I got
back here in time for a late dinner; went my rounds—all well; and
set this down whilst waiting for sleep.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"It is coming. 11 September .—This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found
Van Helsin g in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better . Shortly after
I had arriv ed, a big parcel from abroad  came for the Professor . He
opened it with much impressment—assumed, of course—and
showed a great bundle of white flowers. “These are for you, Miss Lucy ,” he said. “For me? Oh, Dr . Van Helsing!”
“Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines.”
Here Lucy made a wry face. “Nay , but they are not to take in a
decoction or in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so
charming nose, or I shall point out to my friend Arthur what woes he
may have to endure in seeing so much  beauty that he so loves so
much distort. Aha, my pretty miss, that bring the so nice nose all
straight again. This is medicinal, but you do not know how. I put him
in your window , I make pretty wreath, and hang him round your
neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the lotus flower , make
your troub le forgotten. It smell so like the waters of Lethe, and of
that fount ain of youth that the Conquistadores sought for in the
Floridas, and find him all too late.”
Whilst he was speak ing, Lucy had been examining the flowers and
smelling them. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-
laughter , and half-disgust:—
“Oh, Professor , I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why , these flowers are only common garlic.”
To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his
sternness, his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:—6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

"There is grim purpose in all I
do; and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake
of others if not for your own.” Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she
might well be, he went on more gently: “Oh, little miss, my dear, do
not fear me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you
in those so common flowers.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the wreath that you are to wear . But hush!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"no telling
to others that make so inquisitive questions. We must obey , and
silence is a part of obedience; and obed ience is to bring you strong
and well into loving arms that wait for you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall help me deck the room
with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem, where my friend
Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-ho uses all the year. I had to
telegraph yesterday , or they would not have been here.”
We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The
Professor ’s actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any
pharmacopœia that I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows
and latched them securely; next, taking  a handful of the flowers, he
rubbed them all over the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff
of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then
with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the door, above, below ,
and at each side, and round the firepl ace in the same way. It all
seemed grotesque to me, and presently I said:—
“Well, Professor , I know you always have a reason for what you
do, but this certainly  puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here,
or he would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil
spirit.”
“Perhaps I am!” he answered quietly as he began to make the
wreath which Lucy was to wear round her neck. We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and
when she was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic
round her neck. The last words he said to her were:—
“Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close,
do not to-night open the window or the door .”
“I promise ,” said Lucy , “and thank you both a thousand times for
all your kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with
such friends?”
As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing
said:—
“To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want—two nights of
travel, much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the
day to follow , and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in
the morning early you call for me, and we come together to see our
pretty miss, so much more strong for my ‘spell’  which I have work. Ho! ho!”
He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence
two nights before and with the banefu l result, felt awe and vague
terror . It must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it
to my friend, but I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

"I quite love that dear
Dr. Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these
flowers. He positively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he
must have been right, for I feel comfort from them already . Somehow , I do not dread being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep
without fear. I shall not mind any flapping outside the window . Oh,
the terrible struggle that I have had against sleep so often of late; the
pain of the sleepless ness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such
unknown horrors as it has for me! How blessed are some people,
whose lives have no fears, no dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing
that comes nightly , and brings nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I
am to-night, hoping for sleep, and lying like Ophelia in the play, with
“virgin crants and maiden strewments.” I never liked garlic before,
but to-night it is delightful! There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep
coming already . Good-night, everybody .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Dr. Sewar d’s Diary . 13 September .—Called at the Berk eley and found Van Helsing, as
usual, up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now . Let all be put down exactly . Van Helsing and I arrived at
Hillingham at eight o’clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright
sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the
completion of nature’ s annual work. The leaves were turning to all
kinds of beautiful colours, but had not yet begun to drop from the
trees. When we entered we met Mrs. Westenra coming out of the
morning room. She is always an early riser. She greeted us warmly
and said:—
“You will be glad to know that Lucy is better . The dear child is
still asleep . I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest
I should disturb her.” The Professor  smiled, and looked quite
jubilant. He rubbed his hands together , and said:—
“Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is
working,” to which she answered:—
“You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor . Lucy’ s state
this morning is due in part to me.”
“How you do mean, ma’am?” asked the Professor . “Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went
into her room. She was sleeping soundly—so soundly that even my
coming did not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There
were a lot of those horrible, strong-smelling flowers about
everywhere, and she had actually a bunch of them round her neck. I
feared that the heavy odour would be too much for the dear child in
her weak state, so I took them all away and opened a bit of the
window to let in a little fresh air. You will be pleased with her, I am
sure.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 102/291She move d off into her boudoir , wher e she usually breakfasted
early . As she had spoken, I watched the Professor ’s face, and saw it
turn ashen grey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst
the poor lady was present, for he knew her state and how
mischievous a shock would be; he actua lly smiled on her as he held
open the door for her to pass into her room. But the instant she had
disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and forcibly , into the dining-
room and closed the door . Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair , and then
beat his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a
chair , and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud,
dry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised his arms again, as though appealing to the whole
universe. “God! God! God!” he said. “What have we done, what has
this poor thing done , that we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst
us still, sent down from the pagan world of old, that such things must
be, and in such way? This poor mothe r, all unknowing, and all for
the best as she think, does such thing as lose her daughter body and
soul; and we must not tell her, we must not even warn her, or she die,
and then both die. Oh, how we are beset! How are all the powers of
the devils against us!” Suddenly he jumped to his feet. “Come,” he
said, “com e, we must see and act. Devils or no devils, or all the
devils at once, it matters not; we fight him all the same.” He went to
the hall-door for his bag; and together we went up to Lucy’ s room. Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards
the bed. This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with
the same awful, waxen pallor as befor e. He wore a look of stern
sadness and infinite pity . “As I expected,” he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his
which meant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door,
and then began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet
another operation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised
the necessity , and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with
a warning hand. “No!” he said. “To-day you must operate. I shall
provide. You are weakened already .” As he spoke he took off his coat
and rolled up his shirt-sleeve. Again the operation; again the narcot ic; again some return of
colour to the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested. Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she
must not remove anything from Lucy’ s room without consulting
him; that the flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing
of their odour was a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the
care of the case himself, saying that he would watch this night and
the next and would send me word when to come. After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright
and seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal. What does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit
of life amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain. Lucy W estenra’ s Diary .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 103/29117 September .—Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so
strong again that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed
through some long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the
beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I
have a dim half-rem embrance of long, anxious times of waiting and
fearing; darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to
make present distress more poignant: and then long spells of
oblivion, and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a
great press of water . Since, however , Dr. Van Helsing has been with
me, all this bad dreaming seems to have  passed away; the noises that
used to frighten me out of my wits—the flapping against the
windows, the distant voices which seemed so close to me, the harsh
sounds that came from I know not where and commanded me to do I
know not what—hav e all ceased. I go to bed now without any fear of
sleep.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

"Van Helsing is going away , as he has to be for a day in
Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left
alone. Thank God for mother ’s sake, and dear Arthur ’s, and for all
our friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change,
for last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I
found him asleep twice when I awoke ; but I did not fear to go to
sleep again, although the boughs or bats or something napped almost
angrily against the window-panes. “The Pall Mall Gazette,” 18 September . THE ESCAPED WOLF . PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER. Interview with the Keeper in the Zoölogical Gar dens. After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually
using the words “Pall Mall Gazette” as a sort of talisman, I managed
to find the keeper of the section of the Zoölogical Gardens in which
the wolf department is included. Thom as Bilder lives in one of the
cottages in the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just
sitting down to his tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are
hospitable folk, elderly , and without children, and if the specimen I
enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must
be pretty comfortable. The keeper woul d not enter on what he called
“business” until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then
when the table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:—
“Now , sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You’ll
excoose me refoosin’  to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I
gives the wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section

him into a talkative humour . “’Ittin’  of them over the ’ead with a pole is one way; scratchin’  of

that was ’ittin’  me over the ’ead; but the ’arf-quid made that all right. I weren’ t a-goin’  to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my
’owl as the wolves, and lions, and tigers  does. But, Lor’ love yer ’art,
now that the old ’ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an’
rinsed me out with her bloomin’  old teapot, and I’ve lit hup, you may
scratch my ears for all you’re worth, and won’ t git even a growl out
of me. Drive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin’  at,
that ’ere escaped wolf.”
“Exactly . I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it
happened; and when I know the facts I’ll get you to say what you
consider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will
end.”
“All right, guv’nor . This ’ere is about the ’ole story . That ’ere wolf
what we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from
Norway to Jamrach’ s, which we bough t off him four years ago. He
was a nice well-beh aved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I’m more surprised at ’im for wantin’  to get out nor any other animile
in the place. But, there, you can’ t trust wolves no more nor women.”
“Don’ t you mind him, sir!” broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery
laugh. “’E’s got mindin’ the animiles so long that blest if he ain’t like
a old wolf ’isself! But there ain’ t no ’arm in ’im.”
“Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin’  yesterday when I
first hear my disturbance. I was makin’  up a litter in the monkey-
house for a young puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin’
and ’owlin’  I kem away straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin’  like a
mad thing at the bars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn’ t much
people about that day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall,
thin chap, with a ’ook nose and a pointed beard, with a few white
hairs runnin’ through it. He had a ’ard, cold look and red eyes, and I
took a sort of mislike to him, for it seemed as if it was ’im as they
was hirritated at. He ’ad white kid gloves on ’is ’ands, and he
pointed out the animiles to me and says: ‘Keeper , these wolves seem
upset at something.’
“‘Maybe it’s you,’  says I, for I did not like the airs as he give
’isself. He didn’ t git angry , as I ’oped he would, but he smiled a kind
of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. ‘Oh no,
they wouldn’ t like me,’  ’e says. “‘Ow yes, they would,’  says I, a-imitatin’  of him. ‘They always
likes a bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you
’as a bagful.’
“Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin’
they lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke
his ears same as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he
didn’ t put in his hand and stroke the old wolf ’s ears too!6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

“‘Never mind,’  he says. ‘I’m used to ’em!’
“‘Are you in the business yourself?’  I says, tyking off my ’at, for a
man what trades in wolves, anceterer , is a good friend to keepers. “‘No,’  says he, ‘not exactly in the busine ss, but I ’ave made pets of
several.’  And with that he lifts his ’at as perlite as a lord, and walks
away . Old Bersicker kep’ a-lookin’  arter ’im till ’e was out of sight,
and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn’ t come hout the
’ole hevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the
wolves here all began a-’owling. There  warn’ t nothing for them to
’owl at. There warn’ t no one near, except some one that was
evidently a-callin’  a dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the
Park road. Once or twice I went out to see that all was right, and it
was, and then the ’owling stopped. Just before twelve o’clock I just
took a look round afore turnin’  in, an’, bust me, but when I kem
opposite to old Bersicker ’s cage I see the rails broken and twisted
about and the cage empty . And that’ s all I know for certing.”
“Did any one else see anything?”
“One of our gard’ners was a-comin’  ’ome about that time from a
’armony , when he sees a big grey dog comin’ out through the garding
’edges. At least, so he says, but I don’t give much for it myself, for if
he did ’e never said a word about it to his missis when ’e got ’ome,
and it was only after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we
had been up all night-a-huntin’  of the Park for Bersicker , that he
remembered seein’  anything. My own belief was that the ’armony
’ad got into his ’ead.”
“Now , Mr. Bilder , can you account in any way for the escape of
the wolf?”
“Well, sir,” he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty , “I think I
can; but I don’ t know as ’ow you’d be satisfied with the theory .”
“Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from
experience, can’t hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to
try?”
“Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that ’ere
wolf escaped—simply because he wanted to get out.”
From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the
joke I could see that it had done service before, and that the whole
explanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn’ t cope in badinage
with the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his
heart, so I said:—
“Now , Mr. Bilder , we’ll consider that first half-sovereign worked
off, and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you’ve told
me what you think will happen.”
“Right y’are, sir,” he said briskly . “Ye’ll excoose me, I know , for
a-chaf fin’ of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as
much as telling me to go on.”
“Well, I never!” said the old lady . “My opini on is this: that ’ere wolf is a-’idin’  of, somewheres. The
gard’ner wot didn’ t remember said he was a-gallopin’  northward
faster than a horse could go; but I don’t believe him, for, yer see, sir,

gets in packs and does be chivyin’  some thin’ that’s more afeared than
they is they can make a devil of a noise  and chop it up, whatever it
is. But, Lor’ bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not
half so clever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much
fight in ’im. This one ain’t been used to fightin’  or even to providin’
for hisself , and more like he’s somewhe re round the Park a-’idin’  an’

"Bilder ’s face doubled its
natural length with surprise. “God bless me!” he said. “If there ain’t old Bersicker come back
by ’isself!”
He went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding
it seemed to me. I have always thoug ht that a wild animal never
looks so well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is
between us; a personal experience has intensified rather than
diminished that idea. After all, however , there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder
nor his wife thought  any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The
animal itself was as peaceful and well- behaved as that father of all
picture-wolves—Red Riding Hood’ s quondam friend, whilst moving
her confidence in masquerade. The whol e scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and
pathos. The wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London
and set all the children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there
in a sort of penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of
vulpine prodigal son. Old Bilder exam ined him all over with most
tender solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:—
“There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of
trouble; didn’ t I say it all along? Here’ s his head all cut and full of
broken glass. ’E’s been a-gettin’  over some bloomin’  wall or other . It’s a shym e that people are allowed to top their walls with broken
bottles. This ’ere’ s what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker .”
He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of
meat that satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions
of the fatted calf, and went of f to report. I came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is
given to-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo. Dr.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

my books, which, through press of other  work and the many visits to
Lucy , had fallen sadly into arrear . Sudde nly the door was burst open,6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 107/291and in rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was
thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord
into the Superintendent’ s study is almost unknown. Without an
instant’ s pause he made straight at me. He had a dinner -knife in his
hand, and, as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table
between us. He was too quick and too strong for me, however; for
before I could get my balance he had struck at me and cut my left
wrist rathe r severely . Before he could strike again, however , I got in
my right and he was sprawling on his back on the floor . My wrist
bled freely , and quite a little pool trickle d on to the carpet. I saw that
my friend was not intent on further effort, and occupied myself
binding up my wrist, keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all
the time. When the attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention
to him, his employment positively sicke ned me. He was lying on his
belly on the floor licking up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen
from my wounded wrist. He was easily secured, and, to my surprise,
went with the attendants quite placidly , simply repeating over and
over again: “The blood is the life! The blood is the life!”
I cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much
of late for my physic al good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy’ s
illness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited and
weary , and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not
summoned me, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not
well do without it. Telegram, V an Helsing, Antwerp, to Sewar d, Carfax. (Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given; delivered late by

no one may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an
exact record of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of
weakness, and have barely strength to write, but it must be done if I
die in the doing. I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as
Dr. Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep. I was waked by the flapping at the window , which had begun after
that sleep- walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and
which now I know so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in the next room—as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 108/291—so that I might have called him. I tried to go to sleep, but could
not. Then there came to me the old fear of sleep, and I determined to
keep awak e. Pervers ely sleep would try to come then when I did not
want it; so, as I feared to be alone, I opened my door and called out:
“Is there anybody there?” There was no answer . I was afraid to wake
mother , and so closed my door again. Then outside in the shrubbery I
heard a sort of howl  like a dog’s, but more fierce and deeper . I went
to the window and looked out, but could see nothing, except a big
bat, which had evidently been buffeting its wings against the
window . So I went back to bed again, but determined not to go to
sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in; seeing by
my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She said to
me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:—
“I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were
all right.”
I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come
in and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me;
she did not take off her dressing gown,  for she said she would only
stay a while and then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my
arms, and I in hers,  the flapping and buffeting came to the window
again. She was startled and a little frightened, and cried out: “What is
that?” I tried to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet;
but I could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly . After a
while there was the low howl again out in the shrubbery , and shortly
after there  was a crash at the window , and a lot of broken glass was
hurled on the floor . The window blind blew back with the wind that
rushed in, and in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head
of a great, gaunt grey wolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and
struggled up into a sitting posture, and clutched wildly at anything
that would  help her. Amongst other things, she clutched the wreath
of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing insisted on my wearing round my
neck, and tore it away from me. For a second or two she sat up,
pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in
her throat; then she fell over—as if struck with lightning, and her
head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a moment or two. The
room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my eyes fixed on
the window , but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole myriad of
little speck s seemed to come blowing in through the broken window ,
and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers
describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to stir, but there
was some spell upon me, and dear mother ’s poor body , which
seemed to grow cold already—for her dear heart had ceased to beat
—weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while. The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered
consciousness again . Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the
dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our
shrubbery , seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was
dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of
the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back
to comfort me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too,
for I could hear their bare feet pattering  outside my door. I called to
them, and they came in, and when they saw what had happened, and
what it was that lay over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 109/291rushed in through the broken window , and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my dear mother , and laid her, covered up
with a sheet, on the bed after I had got up. They were all so
frightened and nervous that I directed them to go to the dining-room
and have each a glass of wine. The door flew open for an instant and
closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went in a body to the
dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear mother ’s
breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing
had told me, but I didn’t like to remove them, and, besides, I would
have some  of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that
the maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer , so I
went to the dining-room to look for them. My heart sank when  I saw what had happened. They all four lay
helpless on the floor , breathing heavily . The decanter of sherry was
on the table half full, but there was a queer , acrid smell about. I was
suspicious, and examined the decanter . It smelt of laudanum, and
looking on the sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother ’s
doctor uses for her—oh! did use—was empty .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

DR. SEWARD’S DIARY
18 September .—I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early . Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked
gently and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or
her mother , and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a
while, finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer . I cursed the laziness  of the servants that they should lie abed at such
an hour— for it was now ten o’clock—and so rang and knocked
again, but more impatiently , but still without response. Hitherto I had
blamed only the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which
seemed drawing tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to
which I had come, too late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of
delay , might mean hours of danger to Lucy , if she had had again one
of those frightful relapses; and I went round the house to try if I
could find by chance an entry anywhere. I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was
fastened and locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I
heard the rapid pit-p at of a swiftly driven horse’ s feet. They stopped
at the gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the
avenue. When he saw me, he gasped out:—
“Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you not get my telegram?”
I answered as quickl y and coherently as I could that I had only got
his telegra m early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in
coming here, and that I could not make any one in the house hear
me. He paused and raised his hat as he said solemnly:—
“Then I fear we are too late. God’ s will be done!” With his usual
recuperative energy, he went on: “Come. If there be no way open to
get in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now .”
We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen
window . The Profes sor took a small surgical saw from his case, and
handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window . I attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then with a long, thin knife we pushe d back the fastening of the
sashes and opened the window . I helped the Professor in, and
followed him. Ther e was no one in the kitchen or in the servants’
rooms, which were close at hand. We tried all the rooms as we went
along, and in the dining-room, dimly lit by rays of light through the
shutters, found four servant-women lying on the floor . There was no
need to think them dead, for their stertorous breathing and the acrid
smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at each other , and as we moved away he
said: “We can attend to them later.” Then we ascended to Lucy’ s
room. For an instant or two we paused at the door to listen, but there6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 111/291was no sound that we could hear. With white faces and trembling
hands, we opened the door gently , and entered the room. How shall  I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women,
Lucy and her mother . The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered
with a white sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the
draught through the broken window , showing the drawn, white face,
with a look of terro r fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy , with face
white and still more drawn. The flowers which had been round her
neck we found upon her mother ’s bosom, and her throat was bare,
showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before, but
looking horribly white and mangled. Without a word the Professor
bent over the bed, his head almost touching poor Lucy’ s breast; then
he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who listens, and leaping
to his feet, he cried out to me:—
“It is not yet too late! Quick!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"quick! Bring the brandy!”
I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and
taste it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I
found on the table. The maids were still breathing, but more
restlessly , and I fancied that the narcoti c was wearing off. I did not
stay to make sure,  but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the
brandy , as on another occasion, on her lips and gums and on her
wrists and the palms of her hands. He said to me:—
“I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those
maids. Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them  get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is
nearly as cold as that beside her. She will need be heated before we
can do anything more.”
I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the
women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently
affected her more strongly , so I lifted her on the sofa and let her
sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back
to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner . I was stern
with them, however , and would not let them talk. I told them that one
life was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would
sacrifice Miss Lucy . So, sobbing and crying, they went about their
way, half clad as they were, and prepared fire and water . Fortunately ,
the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of
hot water . We got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed
her in it. Whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at
the hall door. One of the maids ran off, hurried on some more
clothes, and opened it. Then she returned and whispered to us that
there was a gentlem an who had come with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he must wait, for we
could see no one now. She went away with the message, and,
engrossed with our work, I clean for got all about him. I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such
deadly earnest. I knew—as he knew—that it was a stand-up fight
with death , and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that
I did not understand, but with the sternest look that his face could
wear:—
“If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her
fade away  into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.” He6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 112/291went on with his work with, if possible , renewed and more frenzied
vigour . Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was
beginning to be of some effect. Lucy’ s heart beat a trifle more
audibly to the stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible
movement. Van Helsing’ s face almost beamed, and as we lifted her
from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:—
“The first gain is ours! Check to the King!”
We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been
prepared, and laid her in bed and forced  a few drops of brandy down
her throat. I noticed  that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief
round her throat. She was still unconsci ous, and was quite as bad as,
if not worse than, we had ever seen her . Van Helsin g called in one of the women , and told her to stay with
her and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then
beckoned me out of the room. “We must consult as to what is to be done,” he said as we
descended the stairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and
we passed in, he closing the door carefu lly behind him. The shutters
had been opened, but the blinds were already down, with that
obedience to the etiquette of death which the British woman of the
lower classes always rigidly observes. The room was, therefore,
dimly dark. It was, however , light enough for our purposes. Van
Helsing’ s sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity . He was evidently torturing his mind about something, so I waited for
an instant, and he spoke:—
“What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must
have anoth er transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl’s
life won’ t be worth an hour’s purchase. You are exhausted already; I
am exhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would
have courage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will
open his veins for her?”
“What’ s the matter with me, anyhow?”
The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones
brought relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey
Morris. Van Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face
softened and a glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: “Quincey
Morris!” and rushed towards him with outstretched hands. “What brought you here?” I cried as our hands met. “I guess Art is the cause.”
He handed me a telegram:—
“Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly
anxious. Cannot leave.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Father still in same condition. Send me word
how Lucy is. Do not delay .—H        .”
“I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only
to tell me what to do.”
Van Helsi ng strode forward, and took his hand, looking him
straight in the eyes as he said:—
“A brave man’ s blood is the best thing on this earth when a
woman is in trouble. You’re a man and no mistake. Well, the devil6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 113/291may work against us for all he’s worth, but God sends us men when
we want them.”
Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the
heart to go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock
and it told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went
into her veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as
on the other occasi ons. Her struggle back into life was something
frightful to see and hear. However , the action of both heart and lungs
improved, and Van Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of
morphia, as before, and with good effect. Her faint became a
profound slumber . The Professor watched whilst I went downstairs
with Quin cey Morris, and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the
cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down after having a
glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast. Then a
thought struck me, and I went back to the room where Lucy now
was. When  I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or two
of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was thinking
it over as he sat with his hand to his brow .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"There was a look of grim
satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved. He
handed me the paper saying only: “It dropped from Lucy’ s breast
when we carried her to the bath.”
When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor , and after a
pause asked him: “In God’ s name, what does it all mean? Was she, or
is she, mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?” I was so
bewildered that I did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put
out his hand and took the paper , saying:—
“Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"You shall
know and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now
what is it that you came to me to say?” This brought me back to fact,
and I was all myself again. “I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act
properly and wisely , there may be an inquest, and that paper would
have to be produced . I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for
if we had it would surely kill poor Lucy , if nothing else did. I know ,
and you know , and the other doctor who attended her knows, that
Mrs. Westenra had disease of the heart , and we can certify that she
died of it. Let us fill up the certificate  at once, and I shall take it
myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker .”
“Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Truly Miss Lucy , if
she be sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends
that love her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one
old man. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I love you all
the more for it! Now go.”
In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur
telling him that Mrs. Westenra was dead ; that Lucy also had been ill,
but was now going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with
her. I told him where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I
was going said:—
“When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all
to ourselves?” I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty
about the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 114/291come up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make
arrangements. When I got back Quincey was waiting for me.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I told him I would
see him as soon as I knew about Lucy , and went up to her room. She
was still sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from
his seat at her side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered
that he expected her to wake before long and was afraid of
forestalling nature. So I went down to Quincey and took him into the
breakfast-room, where the blinds were not drawn down, and which
was a little more cheerful, or rather less cheerless, than the other
rooms. When we were alone, he said to me:—
“Jack Seward, I don’t want to shove myself in anywhere where
I’ve no right to be; but this is no ordin ary case. You know I loved
that girl and wanted to marry her; but, although that’s all past and
gone, I can’t help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it
that’s wrong with her? The Dutchman—and a fine old fellow he is; I
can see that—said, that time you two came into the room, that you
must have another  transfusion of blood, and that both you and he
were exha usted. Now I know well that you medical men speak in
camera , and that a man must not expect to know what they consult
about in private. But this is no common matter , and, whatever it is, I
have done my part. Is not that so?”
“That’ s so,” I said, and he went on:—
“I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I
did to-day . Is not that so?”
“That’ s so.”
“And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago
down at his own place he looked quee r. I have not seen anything
pulled down so quick since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that
I was fond of go to grass all in a night. One of those big bats that
they call vampires had got at her in the night, and what with his
gorge and the vein left open, there wasn ’t enough blood in her to let
her stand up, and I had to put a bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if
you may tell me without betraying confidence, Arthur was the first,
is not that so?” As he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense regardi ng the woman he loved, and
his utter ignorance of the terrible myste ry which seemed to surround
her intensified his pain.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"His very heart was bleeding, and it took all
the manhood of him—and there was a royal lot of it, too—to keep
him from breaking down. I paused before answering, for I felt that I
must not betray anything which the Professor wished kept secret; but
already he knew so much, and guessed so much, that there could be
no reason for not answering, so I answered in the same phrase:
“That’ s so.”
“And how long has this been going on?”
“About ten days.”
“Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty
creature that we all love has had put into her veins within that time
the blood of four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn’ t
hold it.” Then, coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper:
“What took it out?”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 115/291I shook my head. “That,” I said, “is the crux. Van Helsing is
simply frantic about  it, and I am at my wits’  end. I can’t even hazard
a guess. There has been a series of little circumstances which have
thrown out all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall not occur again. Here we stay until all be well—or
ill.” Quincey held out his hand. “Count me in,” he said. “You and the
Dutchman will tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.”
When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy’s first movement was
to feel in her breast , and, to my surprise, produced the paper which
Van Helsi ng had given me to read. The careful Professor had
replaced it where it had come from, lest on waking she should be
alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van Helsing and on me too, and
gladdened. Then she looked around the room, and seeing where she
was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her poor thin hands
before her pale face. We both understood what that meant—that she
had realised to the full her mother ’s death; so we tried what we could
to comfort  her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but she was
very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for a
long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain
with her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk
she fell into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still
asleep she took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van
Helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her. All the same,
however , she went on with the action of tearing, as though the
material were still in her hands; finally she lifted her hands and
opened them as though scattering the fragments. Van Helsing seemed
surprised, and his brows gathered as if in thought, but he said
nothing. 19 September .—All last night she slept fitfully , being always
afraid to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The
Professor and I took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a
moment unattended . Quincey Morris said nothing about his
intention, but I knew that all night long he patrolled round and round
the house. When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor
Lucy’ s strength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little
nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At
times she slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in
her, between sleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger ,
although more haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open
mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus
looked positively longer and sharper than usual; when she woke the
softness of her eyes evidently changed the expression, for she looked
her own self, although a dying one. In the afternoon she asked for
Arthur , and we telegraphed for him. Quincey went off to meet him at
the station. When he arrived it was nearly six o’cloc k, and the sun was setting
full and warm, and the red light streame d in through the window and
gave more  colour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was
simply choking with emotion, and none of us could speak. In the
hours that had passed, the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition
that passed for it, had grown more frequent, so that the pauses when6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 116/291conversation was possible were shortened. Arthur ’s presence,
however , seemed to act as a stimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke
to him more brightly than she had done since we arrived. He too
pulled himself together , and spoke as cheerily as he could, so that the
best was made of everything. It was now nearly one o’clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting
with her. I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am
entering this on Lucy’ s phonograph. Until six o’clock they are to try
to rest. I fear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has
been too great; the poor child cannot rally . God help us all. Letter , Mina Harker to Lucy W estenra. (Unopened by her .)
“17 September . “My dearest Lucy ,—
“It seems an age since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote. You will pardon me, I know , for all my faults when you have read all
my budget of news. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we
arrived at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though
he had an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house,
where there were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we
dined together . After dinner Mr . Hawkins said:—
“‘My dears, I want to drink your health  and prosperity; and may
every blessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and
have, with love and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to
make your home here with me. I have left to me neither chick nor
child; all are gone, and in my will I have  left you everything.’  I cried,
Lucy dear, as Jonathan and the old man clasped hands. Our evening
was a very , very happy one. “So here we are, installed in this beau tiful old house, and from
both my bedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of
the cathedral close, with their great black stems standing out against
the old yellow stone of the cathedral  and I can hear the rooks
overhead cawing and cawing and chattering and gossiping all day,
after the manner of rooks—and humans. I am busy, I need not tell
you, arranging things and housekeeping. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins
are busy all day; for, now that Jonatha n is a partner , Mr. Hawkins
wants to tell him all about the clients. “How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to
town for a day or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so
much on my shoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is
beginning to put some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly
weakened by the long illness; even now he sometimes starts out of
his sleep in a sudden way and awakes all trembling until I can coax
him back to his usual placidity . However , thank God, these occasions
grow less frequent as the days go on, and they will in time pass away
altogether , I trust.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"And now I have told you my news, let me ask
yours. When are you to be married, and where, and who is to
perform the ceremo ny, and what are you to wear , and is it to be a
public or a private wedding? Tell me all about it, dear; tell me all
about everything, for there is nothing which interests you which will
not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to send his ‘respectful duty,’ but
I do not think that is good enough from the junior partner of the6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

"“20 September . “My dear Sir ,—
“In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the
conditions of everything left in my charge.... With regard to patient,
Renfield, there is more to say. He has had another outbreak, which
might have had a dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately
happened, was unattended with any unhappy results. This afternoon
a carrier ’s cart with two men made a call at the empty house whose
grounds abut on ours—the house to which, you will remember , the
patient twice ran away . The men stopped at our gate to ask the porter
their way, as they were strangers. I was myself looking out of the
study window , having a smoke after dinner , and saw one of them
come up to the house. As he passed the window of Renfield’ s room,
the patient began to rate him from within, and called him all the foul
names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a decent
fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to “shut up for a
foul-mouthed beggar ,” whereon our man accused him of robbing him
and wantin g to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he
were to swing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not
to notice, so he contented himself after looking the place over and
making up his mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by
saying: ‘Lor’ bless yer, sir, I wouldn’ t mind what was said to me in a
bloomin’  madhouse. I pity ye and the guv’nor for havin’  to live in the
house with a wild beast like that.’  Then he asked his way civilly
enough, and I told him where the gate of the empty house was; he
went away , followed by threats and curses and revilings from our
man. I went down to see if I could make out any cause for his anger ,
since he is usually such a well-behaved man, and except his violent
fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred. I found him, to my
astonishment, quite composed and most genial in his manner . I tried
to get him to talk of the incident, but he blandly asked me questions
as to what I meant, and led me to believe that he was completely
oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to say, however , only
another instance of his cunning, for within half an hour I heard of
him again. This time he had broken out through the window of his
room, and was running down the avenue . I called to the attendants to
follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent on some
mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which had
passed before coming down the road, having on it some great
wooden boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were
flushed in the face, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up
to him the patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the
cart, began  to knock his head against the ground. If I had not seized
him just at the mom ent I believe he would have killed the man there
and then. The other  fellow jumped down and struck him over the6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 118/291head with the butt-e nd of his heavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but
he did not seem to mind it, but seized him also, and struggled with
the three of us, pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens. You know
I am no light weight, and the others were both burly men. At first he
was silent in his fighting; but as we began to master him, and the
attendants were putting a strait-waistcoa t on him, he began to shout:
‘I’ll frustrate them! They shan’ t rob me! they shan’ t murder me by
inches! I’ll fight for my Lord and Master!’  and all sorts of similar
incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable difficulty that they
got him back to the house and put him in the padded room. One of
the attendants, Hardy , had a finger broke n. However , I set it all right;
and he is going on well. “The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for
damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Their threats were, however , mingled with some sort of indirect
apology for the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They
said that if it had not been for the way their strength had been spent
in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have
made short work of him. They gave as another reason for their defeat
the extraordinary state of drouth to which they had been reduced by
the dusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance
from the scene of their labours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather
more of the same, and with each a sovereign in hand, they made light
of the attack, and swore that they would encounter a worse madman
any day for the pleasure of meeting so ‘bloomin’  good a bloke’  as
your corre spondent. I took their names  and addresses, in case they
might be needed.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

“18 September . “My dearest Lucy ,—
“Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died very
suddenly . Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come
to so love him that it really seems as though we had lost a father . I
never knew either father or mother , so that the dear old man’ s death
is a real blow to me. Jonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that
he feels sorrow , deep sorrow , for the dear, good man who has
befriended him all his life, and now at the end has treated him like
his own son and left him a fortune which to people of our modest
bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice, but Jonathan
feels it on another account. He says the amount of responsibility
which it puts upon  him makes him nervous. He begins to doubt6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave shock that he
experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hard that a sweet,
simple, noble, strong nature such as his—a nature which enabled him
by our dear, good friend’ s aid to rise from clerk to master in a few
years—should be so injured that the very essence of its strength is
gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in the midst
of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one, for the
strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan
tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming
up to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr. Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his
father . As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief
mourner . I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few
minutes. For give me for troubling you. With all blessings,

Dr. Sewar d’s Diary . 20 September .—Only resolution and habit can let me make an
entry to-night. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the
world and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I
heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late
—Lucy’ s mother and Arthur ’s father , and now.... Let me get on with
my work. I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy . We wanted
Arthur to go to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I
told him that we should want him to help us during the day, and that
we must not all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer,
that he agreed to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. “Come, my
child,” he said; “com e with me. You are sick and weak, and have had
much sorrow and much mental pain, as well as that tax on your
strength that we know of. You must not be alone; for to be alone is to
be full of fears and alarms. Come to the drawing-room, where there
is a big fire, and there are two sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on
the other , and our sympathy will be comfort to each other , even
though we do not speak, and even if we sleep.” Arthur went off with
him, casting back a longing look on Lucy’ s face, which lay in her
pillow , almost white r than the lawn. She lay quite still, and I looked
round the room to see that all was as it should be. I could see that the
Professor had carried out in this room, as in the other , his purpose of
using the garlic; the whole of the window-sashes reeked with it, and
round Lucy’s neck, over the silk handkerchief which Van Helsing
made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertoro usly, and her face was at its
worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her teeth, in the
dim, unce rtain light, seemed longer and sharper than they had been
in the morning. In particular , by some trick of the light, the canine
teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her, and
presently she moved uneasily . At the same moment there came a sort
of dull flapping or buffeting at the window.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I went over to it softly ,
and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full
moonlight, and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat,6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 120/291which wheeled round—doubtless attracted by the light, although so
dim—and every now and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat, I found that Lucy had moved slightly ,
and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat. I replaced them
as well as I could, and sat watching her . Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had
prescribed. She took but a little, and that languidly . There did not
seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and
strength that had hitherto so marked her illness. It struck me as
curious that the mom ent she became conscious she pressed the garlic
flowers close to her. It was certainly odd that whenever she got into
that lethar gic state, with the stertorous breathing, she put the flowers
from her; but that when she waked she clutched them close. There
was no possibility of making any mista ke about this, for in the long
hours that followed,  she had many spells of sleeping and waking and
repeated both actions many times. At six o’clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then
fallen into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw
Lucy’ s face I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said
to me in a sharp whisper: “Draw up the blind; I want light!” Then he
bent down , and, with his face almost touching Lucy’ s, examined her
carefully . He removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief
from her throat. As he did so he started back, and I could hear his
ejaculation, “Mein Gott!” as it was smothered in his throat. I bent
over and looked, too, and as I noticed some queer chill came over
me. The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared. For fully five minut es Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his
face at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:—
“She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference,
mark me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor
boy, and let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have
promised him.”
I went to the dining -room and waked him. He was dazed for a
moment, but when he saw the sunlig ht streaming in through the
edges of the shutters he thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I
assured him that Lucy was still asleep, but told him as gently as I
could that both Van Helsing and I feared that the end was near. He
covered his face with his hands, and slid down on his knees by the
sofa, where he remained, perhaps a minute, with his head buried,
praying, whilst his shoulders shook with grief. I took him by the
hand and raised him up. “Come,” I said, “my dear old fellow ,
summon all your fortitude: it will be best and easiest for her .”
When we came into Lucy’ s room I could see that Van Helsing had,
with his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making
everything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy’ s
hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we
came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered
softly:—
“Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!” He was
stooping to kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. “No,” he
whispered, “not yet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 121/291So Arthur took her hand and knelt besid e her, and she looked her
best, with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit
her breast heaved softly, and her breath  came and went like a tired
child’ s. And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had
noticed in the night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth
opened, and the pale gums, drawn back , made the teeth look longer
and sharper than ever. In a sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious
way she opened her eyes, which were now dull and hard at once, and
said in a soft, voluptuous voice, such as I had never heard from her
lips:—
“Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!”
Arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing,
who, like me, had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and
catching him by the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a
fury of strength which I never thought he could have possessed, and
actually hurled him almost across the room. “Not for your life!” he said; “not for your living soul and hers!”
And he stood between them like a lion at bay . Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know
what to do or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize
him he realised the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting. I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy , as did Van Helsing, and we saw a
spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth
champed together . Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily . Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and
putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing’ s great brown
one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. “My true friend,” she said, in a
faint voice, but with untellable pathos, “My true friend, and his! Oh,
guard him, and give me peace!”
“I swear it!” he said solemnly , kneeling beside her and holding up
his hand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur , and
said to him: “Come,  my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on
the forehead, and only once.”
Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted. Lucy’ s eyes closed; and Van Helsing,  who had been watching
closely , took Arthur ’s arm, and drew him away . And then Lucy’ s breathing became stertorous again, and all at
once it ceased. “It is all over ,” said Van Helsing. “She is dead!”
I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room,
where he sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a
way that nearly broke me down to see. I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor
Lucy , and his face was sterner than ever. Some change had come
over her body . Death had given back part of her beauty , for her brow
and cheeks had recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips
had lost their deadly pallor . It was as if the blood, no longer needed

I stood beside Van Helsing, and said:—

He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:—
“Not so; alas!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

DR. SEWARD’S DIARY—continued. THE funeral was arrange d for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy
and her mother migh t be buried together . I attended to all the ghastly
formalities, and the urbane undertaker  proved that his staff were
afflicted—or blessed—with something of his own obsequious
suavity . Even the woman who performe d the last offices for the dead
remarked to me, in a confidential, brother -professional way, when
she had come out from the death-chamber:—
“She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It’s quite a privilege to
attend on her. It’s not too much to say that she will do credit to our
establishment!”
I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away . This was possible
from the disordered  state of things in the household. There were no
relatives at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend
at his father ’s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should
have been bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took
it upon ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking
over Lucy ’s papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he,
being a foreigner , might not be quite aware of English legal
requirements, and so might in ignorance make some unnecessary
trouble. He answered me:—
“I know; I know . You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor . But this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you
avoided the coroner . I have more than him to avoid. There may be
papers more—such as this.”
As he spoke he took from his pocke t-book the memorandum
which had been in Lucy’ s breast, and which she had torn in her
sleep. “When you find anything of the solicito r who is for the late Mrs. Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch
here in the room and in Miss Lucy’ s old room all night, and I myself
search for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into
the hands of strangers.”
I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had
found the name and address of Mrs. Westenra’ s solicitor and had
written to him. All the poor lady’ s papers were in order; explicit
directions regarding  the place of burial were given. I had hardly
sealed the letter , when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the
room, saying:—
“Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is
to you.”
“Have you got what you looked for?” I asked, to which he replied:
—
“I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and
find I have, all that there was—only some letters and a few6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 124/291memoranda, and a diary new begun. But I have them here, and we
shall for the present say nothing of them . I shall see that poor lad to-
morrow evening, and, with his sanction, I shall use some.”
When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:—
“And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep,
both you and I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have
much to do, but for the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!”
Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy . The undertaker
had certai nly done his work well, for the room was turned into a
small chapelle ardente . There was a wilderness of beautiful white
flowers, and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end
of the winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent
over and turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before
us, the tall wax cand les showing a sufficient light to note it well. All
Lucy’ s loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that
had passed, instead of leaving traces of “decay’ s effacing fingers,”
had but restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe
my eyes that I was looking at a corpse. The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had,
and there was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: “Remain
till I return,” and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild
garlic from  the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been
opened, and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the
bed. Then he took from his neck, inside his collar , a little gold
crucifix, and placed  it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its
place, and we came away . I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap
at the door , he entered, and at once began to speak:—
“To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-
mortem knives.”
“Must we make an autopsy?” I asked. “Yes and no.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell
you now, but not a word to another . I want to cut off her head and
take out her heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I
have seen with no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and
death that make the rest shudder . Oh, but I must not forget, my dear
friend John, that you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I
that shall operate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-
night, but for Arthur I must not; he will be free after his father ’s
funeral to-morrow , and he will want to see her—to see it. Then,
when she is coffined ready for the next day, you and I shall come
when all sleep. We shall unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our
operation: and then replace all, so that none know , save we alone.”
“But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor
body without need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem
and nothing to gain by it—no good to her, to us, to science, to human
knowledge—why do it? Without such it is monstrous.”
For answer he put his hand on my shoulder , and said, with infinite
tenderness:—
“Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding  heart; and I love you the
more because it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the
burden that you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 125/291that you shall know , and bless me for knowing, though they are not
pleasant things. John, my child, you have been my friend now many
years, and yet did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I
may err—I am but man; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these
causes that you send for me when the great trouble came?","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Yes! Were
you not amazed, nay horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his
love—though she was dying—and snatched him away by all my
strength? Yes! And yet you saw how she thanked me, with her so
beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so weak, and she kiss my rough
old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not hear me swear promise
to her , that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes! “Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for
many years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be
things so strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a
little, frien d John. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think;
and that is not perhaps well. And if I work—as work I shall, no
matter trust or no trust—without my friend trust in me, I work with
heavy heart and feel, oh! so lonely when  I want all help and courage
that may be!” He paused a moment and went on solemnly: “Friend
John, there  are strange and terrible days before us. Let us not be two,
but one, that so we work to a good end. Will you not have faith in
me?”
I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went
away , and watched him go into his room and close the door. As I
stood without moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the
passage—she had her back towards me, so did not see me—and go
into the room where  Lucy lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so
rare, and we are so grateful to those who show it unasked to those we
love. Here was a poor girl putting aside the terrors which she
naturally had of death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress
whom she loved, so that the poor clay might not be lonely till laid to
eternal rest.... I must have slept long and soundly , for it was broad daylight when
Van Helsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to
my bedside and said:—
“You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.”
“Why not?” I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had
greatly impressed me. “Because,” he said sternly , “it is too late—or too early . See!” Here
he held up the little golden crucifix. “This was stolen in the night.”
“How , stolen,” I asked in wonder , “since you have it now?”
“Because I get it back from the worth less wretch who stole it,
from the woman who robbed the dead and the living. Her
punishment will surely come, but not through me; she knew not
altogether what she did and thus unknow ing, she only stole. Now we
must wait.”
He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to
think of, a new puzzle to grapple with. The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came:
Mr. Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He
was very genial and very appreciative of what we had done, and took6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 126/291off our hands all cares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for some time expected sudden death from her heart,
and had put her affairs in absolute order; he informed us that, with
the exception of a certain entailed property of Lucy’ s father ’s which
now, in default of direct issue, went back to a distant branch of the
family , the whole estate, real and personal, was left absolutely to
Arthur Holmwood. When he had told us so much he went on:—
“Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary
disposition, and pointed out certain contingencies that might leave
her daughter either penniless or not so free as she should be to act
regarding a matrimonial alliance. Indee d, we pressed the matter so
far that we almost came into collision, for she asked us if we were or
were not prepared to carry out her wishes. Of course, we had then no
alternative but to accept. We were right in principle, and ninety-nine
times out of a hundred we should have proved, by the logic of
events, the accuracy of our judgment. Frankly , however , I must admit
that in this case any other form of disposition would have rendered
impossible the carrying out of her wishes. For by her predeceasing
her daugh ter the latter would have come into possession of the
property , and, even had she only survived her mother by five
minutes, her property would, in case there were no will—and a will
was a practical impo ssibility in such a case—have been treated at her
decease as under intestacy . In which case Lord Godalming, though
so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the
inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just
rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger . I assure
you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.”
He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing  at the one little part—in
which he was officially interested—of  so great a tragedy , was an
object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding. He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day
and see Lord Godal ming. His coming, however , had been a certain
comfort to us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread
hostile criticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five
o’clock, so a little before that time we visited the death-chamber . It
was so in very truth,  for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The
undertaker , true to his craft, had made the best display he could of
his goods, and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered
our spirits at once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be
adhered to, explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very
soon, it would be less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was
left of his fiancée  quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his
own stupi dity and exerted himself to restore things to the condition
in which we left them the night before , so that when Arthur came
such shocks to his feelings as we could avoid were saved. Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his
stalwart manhood seemed to have shrun k somewhat under the strain
of his much-tried emotions. He had, I knew , been very genuinely and
devotedly attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time,
was a bitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van
Helsing he was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that
there was some constraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too,
and motioned me to bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 127/291door of the room, as I felt he would like to be quite alone with her,
but he took my arm and led me in, saying huskily:—
“You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there
was no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don’t know
how to thank you for all you have done for her . I can’ t think yet....”
Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my
shoulders and laid his head on my breast, crying:—
“Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone
from me all at once,  and there is nothing in the wide world for me to
live for .”
I comforte d him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need
much expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over
the shoulder , a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a
man’ s heart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away , and then I
said softly to him:—
“Come and look at her .”
Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her
face. God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be
enhancing her loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat;
and as for Arthur , he fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with
doubt as with an ague. At last, after a long pause, he said to me in a
faint whisper:—
“Jack, is she really dead?”
I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest—for I
felt that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment
longer than I could help—that it often happened that after death
faces became softened and even resolve d into their youthful beauty;
that this was especially so when death  had been preceded by any
acute or prolonged suffering. It seemed  to quite do away with any
doubt, and, after kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at
her loving ly and long, he turned aside. I told him that that must be
good-bye, as the coffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took
her dead hand in his and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her
forehead. He came away , fondly lookin g back over his shoulder at
her as he came. I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had
said good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the
undertaker ’s men to proceed with the preparations and to screw up
the coffin. When he came out of the room again I told him of
Arthur ’s question, and he replied:—
“I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!”
We all dined togethe r, and I could see that poor Art was trying to
make the best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner -time;
but when we had lit our cigars he said—
“Lord——”; but Arthur interrupted him:—
“No, no, not that, for God’ s sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me,
sir: I did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is
so recent.”
The Professor answered very sweetly:—
“I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you
‘Mr.,’ and I have grown to love you—yes, my dear boy, to love you6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 128/291—as Arthur .”
Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man’ s warmly . “Call me what you will,” he said.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"“I hope I may always have the
title of a friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank
you for your goodne ss to my poor dear.” He paused a moment, and
went on: “I know that she understood your goodness even better than
I do; and if I was rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted
so—you remember ”—the Professor nodded—“you must forgive
me.”
He answered with a grave kindness:—
“I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such
violence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not—that you
cannot—trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may
be more times when  I shall want you to trust when you cannot—and
may not—and must not yet understand. But the time will come when
your trust shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall
understand as though the sunlight hims elf shone through. Then you
shall bless  me from first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of
others and for her dear sake to whom I swore to protect.”
“And, indeed, indeed, sir,” said Arthur warmly , “I shall in all ways
trust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you
are Jack’ s friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like.”
The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about
to speak, and finally said:—
“May I ask you something now?”
“Certainly .”
“You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?”
“No, poor dear; I never thought of it.”
“And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy’ s papers and
letters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity . I have a motive of which,
be sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took them
before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might
touch them —no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall
keep them, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep
them safe. No word  shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give
them back to you. It’s a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you
not, for Lucy’ s sake?”
Arthur spoke out heartily , like his old self:—
“Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying
this I am doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not
trouble you with questions till the time comes.”
The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:—
“And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be
all pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too—you most of
all, my dear boy—w ill have to pass through the bitter water before
we reach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and
do our duty , and all will be well!”
I slept on a sofa in Arthur ’s room that night. Van Helsing did not
go to bed at all. He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

lily and rose, a heavy , overpowering smell into the night. Mina Harker ’s Journal. 22 September .—In the train to Exeter . Jonathan sleeping. It seems only yester day that the last entry was made, and yet how

"Down it all goes. I am rusty in my
shorthand—see what unexpected prosperity does for us—so it may
be as well to freshen it up again with an exercise anyhow .... The servic e was very simple and very solemn. There were only
ourselves and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from
Exeter , his London  agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John
Paxton, the President of the Incorporate d Law Society . Jonathan and
I stood hand in hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was
gone from us.... We came back to town quietly , taking a ’bus to Hyde Park Corner . Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while,
so we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was
sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us
think of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down
Piccadilly . Jonathan  was holding me by the arm, the way he used to
in old days before I went to school. I felt it very improper , for you
can’t go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other
girls witho ut the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was
Jonathan, and he was my husband, and we didn’ t know anybody who
saw us—a nd we didn’ t care if they did—so on we walked. I was
looking at a very beautiful girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a
victoria outside Guiliano’ s, when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so
tight that he hurt me, and he said under his breath: “My God!” I am
always anxious about Jonathan, for I fear that some nervous fit may
upset him again; so I turned to him quickly , and asked him what it
was that disturbed him. He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in
terror and half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a
beaky nose and black moustache and pointed beard, who was also
observing the pretty girl. He was looking at her so hard that he did
not see either of us, and so I had a good view of him. His face was
not a good  face; it was hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white
teeth, that looked all the whiter because his lips were so red, were
pointed like an animal’s. Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was
afraid he would notice. I feared he might take it ill, he looked so
fierce and nasty . I asked Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he
answered, evidently thinking that I knew as much about it as he did:
“Do you see who it is?”
“No, dear,” I said; “I don’t know him; who is it?” His answer
seemed to shock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know
that it was to me, Mina, to whom he was speaking:—
“It is the man himself!”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

terrified; I do believ e that if he had not had me to lean on and to
support him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came
out of the shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then
drove off. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the
carriage moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and
hailed a hansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to
himself:—
“I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this
be so!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Oh, my God! my God!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"If I only knew! if I only knew!” He
was distre ssing hims elf so much that I feared to keep his mind on the
subject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew him
away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily . We walked a
little furth er, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was a hot day for autumn, and there  was a comfortable seat in a
shady place. After a few minutes’  staring at nothing, Jonathan’ s eyes
closed, and he went quietly into a sleep, with his head on my
shoulder . I thought it was the best thing  for him, so did not disturb
him. In about twenty minutes he woke up, and said to me quite
cheerfully:—
“Why , Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so
rude. Come, and we’ll have a cup of tea somewhere.” He had
evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger , as in his illness he had
forgotten all that this episode had reminded him of. I don’t like this
lapsing into forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to
the brain. I must not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than
good; but I must somehow learn the facts of his journey abroad. The
time is come, I fear, when I must open that parcel, and know what is
written. Oh, Jonatha n, you will, I know , forgive me if I do wrong, but
it is for your own dear sake. Later .—A sad home-coming in every way—the house empty of
the dear soul who was so good to us; Jonathan still pale and dizzy
under a slight relapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van
Helsing, whoever he may be:—

ago, and that Lucy died the day before  yesterday . They were both
buried to-day .”
Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! poor Lucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And poor, poor Arthur ,
to have lost such sweetness out of his life! God help us all to bear
our troubles.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

death as any of us; but he bore himself through it like a moral
Viking. If America can go on breeding  men like that, she will be a
power in the world indeed. Van Helsing  is lying down, having a rest

take him some time. Poor old fellow!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I fear that the strain of the past
week has broken down even his iron strength. All the time of the
burial he was, I could see, putting some  terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were standing beside Arthur , who, poor
fellow , was speaking  of his part in the operation where his blood had
been transfused to his Lucy’ s veins; I could see Van Helsing’ s face
grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was saying that he felt since
then as if they two had been really marr ied and that she was his wife
in the sight of God. None of us said a word of the other operations,
and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went away together to
the station , and Van Helsing and I came on here. The moment we
were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of hysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted that it
was only his sense  of humour asserting itself under very terrible
conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down the
blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried, till
he laughed again; and laughed and cried together , just as a woman
does. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the
circumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different
in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his
face grew grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why
at such a time. His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it
was logical and forceful and mysterious. He said:—
“Ah, you don’t comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am
not sad, though I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did
choke me. But no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the
laugh he come just the same. Keep it always with you that laughter
who knock at your door and say, ‘May I come in?’ is not the true
laughter . No! he is a king, and he come when and how he like. He
ask no person; he choose no time of suitability . He say, ‘I am here.’
Behold, in example  I grieve my heart out for that so sweet young
girl; I give my blood for her, though I am old and worn; I give my
time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other sufferers want that so she
may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very grave—laugh when the
clay from  the spade of the sexton drop upon her coffin and say
‘Thud! thud!’  to my heart, till it send back the blood from my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy—that dear boy, so of the age of
mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his hair
and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yet
when he say things  that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and
make my father -heart yearn to him as to no other man—not even to
you, friend John, for we are more level in experiences than father
and son—yet even at such moment King Laugh he come to me and
shout and bellow in my ear, ‘Here I am! here I am!’ till the blood
come danc e back and bring some of the sunshine that he carry with
him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it is a strange world, a sad world,
a world full of miseries, and woes, and troubles; and yet when King
Laugh come he make them all dance to the tune he play. Bleeding
hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard , and tears that burn as they
fall—all dance toget her to the music that he make with that smileless
mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that he is good to come,
and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn tight with
strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and, like the rain6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the sunshine, and
he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with our labour ,
what it may be.”
I did not like to wound him by pretendi ng not to see his idea; but,
as I did not yet unde rstand the cause of his laughter , I asked him. As
he answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different
tone:—
“Oh, it was the grim  irony of it all—this so lovely lady garlanded
with flowe rs, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered
if she were truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that
lonely churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the
mother who loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell
going ‘Toll! toll! toll!’  so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the
white garm ents of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the
time their eyes neve r on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. And all for what?","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"She is dead; so! Is it not?”
“Well, for the life of me, Professor ,” I said, “I can’t see anything to
laugh at in all that. Why , your explanat ion makes it a harder puzzle
than befor e. But even if the burial service was comic, what about
poor Art and his trouble? Why , his heart was simply breaking.”
“Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins
had made her truly his bride?”
“Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him.”
“Quite so. But there was a difficulty , friend John.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"If so that, then
what about the others?","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a
polyandrist, and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by
Church’ s law, though no wits, all gone—even I, who am faithful
husband to this now-no-wife, am bigamist.”
“I don’t see where the joke comes in there either!” I said; and I did
not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laid
his hand on my arm, and said:—
“Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to
others when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I
can trust. If you could have looked into my very heart then when I
want to laugh; if you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if
you could do so now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and
all that is to him—for he go far, far away from me, and for a long,
long time—maybe you would perhaps pity me the most of all.”
I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why . “Because I know!”
And now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness
will sit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy lies in the tomb of
her kin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from
teeming London; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over
Hampstead Hill, and where wild flowers grow of their own accord. So I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever begin
another . If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal with
different people and different themes; for here at the end, where the
romance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my
life-work, I say sadly and without hope,6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

“The W estminster Gazette,” 25 September . A HAMPSTEAD MYSTER Y. The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with
a series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what
was know n to the writers of headlines as “The Kensington Horror ,”
or “The Stabbing Woman,” or “The Woman in Black.” During the
past two or three days several cases have occurred of young children
straying from home or neglecting to return from their playing on the
Heath. In all these cases the children were too young to give any
properly intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of
their excu ses is that they had been with a “bloofer lady.” It has
always been late in the evening when they have been missed, and on
two occas ions the children have not been found until early in the
following morning. It is generally supposed in the neighbourhood
that, as the first child  missed gave as his reason for being away that a
“bloofer lady” had asked him to come for a walk, the others had
picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served. This is the more
natural as the favourite game of the little ones at present is luring
each other  away by wiles. A corresponde nt writes us that to see some
of the tiny tots pretending to be the “bloofer lady” is supremely
funny . Some of our caricaturists might, he says, take a lesson in the
irony of grotesque by comparing the reality and the picture. It is only
in accordance with general principles  of human nature that the
“bloofer lady” should be the popul ar rôle at these al fresco
performances. Our correspondent naïvely says that even Ellen Terry
could not be so winningly attractive as some of these grubby-faced
little children pretend—and even imagine themselves—to be. There is, however , possibly a serious side to the question, for some
of the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been
slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as
might be made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much
importance individually , would tend to show that whatever animal
inflicts them has a system or method of its own. The police of the
division have been instructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying
children, especially when very young, in and around Hampstead
Heath, and for any stray dog which may be about. “The W estminster Gazette,” 25 September . Extra Special. THE HAMPSTEAD HORROR. ANOTHER CHILD INJURED. The “Bloofer Lady .”
We have just receiv ed intelligence that another child, missed last
night, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at
the Shoote r’s Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, less
frequented than the other parts. It has the same tiny wound in the
throat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL
23 September .—Jonathan is better after a bad night. I am so glad
that he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the
terrible things; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed
down with the responsibility of his new position. I knew he would be
true to himself, and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising
to the height of his advancement and keeping pace in all ways with
the duties that come upon him. He will be away all day till late, for
he said he could not lunch at home. My household work is done, so I
shall take his foreign journal, and lock myself up in my room and
read it.... 24 September .—I hadn’t the heart to write last night; that terrible
record of Jonathan’ s upset me so. Poor dear! How he must have
suffered, whether it be true or only imagination. I wonder if there is
any truth in it at all. Did he get his brain fever , and then write all
those terrible things, or had he some cause for it all? I suppose I shall
never know, for I dare not open the subject to him.... And yet that
man we saw yesterday! He seemed quite certain of him.... Poor
fellow! I suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back
on some train of thought.... He believes it all himself. I remember
how on our weddin g-day he said: “Unl ess some solemn duty come
upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or
sane.” There seems to be through it all some thread of continuity .... That fearf ul Count was coming to Lond on.... If it should be, and he
came to London, with his teeming millio ns.... There may be a solemn
duty; and if it come we must not shrink from it.... I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriter this very hour and begin transcribing. Then
we shall be ready for other eyes if required. And if it be wanted;
then, perhaps, if I am ready , poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I
can speak for him and never let him be troubled or worried with it at
all. If ever Jonathan  quite gets over the nervousness he may want to
tell me of it all, and I can ask him quest ions and find out things, and
see how I may comfort him. Letter , Van Helsing to Mrs.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

MINA  HARKER’S JOURNAL. 25 September .—I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time
draws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect
that it will throw some light upon Jonathan’ s sad experience; and as
he attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all about
her. That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her
sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the
real truth now!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my
imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour . Of course  it is abou t Lucy . That habit came back to the poor dear,
and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost
forgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must
have told him of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I
knew all about it; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows,
so that he may unde rstand. I hope I did right in not saying anything
of it to Mrs. Westenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of
mine, were it even a negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy . I
hope, too, Dr. Van Helsing will not blame me; I have had so much
trouble and anxiety of late that I feel I cannot bear more just at
present. I suppose a cry does us all good at times—clears the air as other
rain does. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me,
and then Jonathan went away this morn ing to stay away from me a
whole day and night, the first time we have been parted since our
marriage. I do hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that
nothing will occur to upset him. It is two o’clock, and the doctor will
be here soon now. I shall say nothing of Jonathan’ s journal unless he
asks me. I am so glad I have type-wri tten out my own journal, so
that, in case he asks about Lucy , I can hand it to him; it will save
much questioning. Later .—He has come and gone.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Oh, what a strange meeting, and
how it all makes my head whirl round ! I feel like one in a dream. Can it be all possible, or even a part of it? If I had not read
Jonathan’ s journal first, I should never have accepted even a
possibility . Poor, poor, dear Jonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may not upset him again. I shall try to
save him from it; but it may be even a consolation and a help to him6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 137/291—terrible though it be and awful in its consequences—to know for
certain that his eyes and ears and brain did not deceive him, and that
it is all true. It may be that it is the doubt which haunts him; that
when the doubt is removed, no matter which—waking or dreaming
—may prove the truth, he will be more satisfied and better able to
bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a good man as well as a
clever one if he is Arthur ’s friend and Dr. Seward’ s, and if they
brought him all the way from Holland to look after Lucy . I feel from
having seen him that he is good and kind and of a noble nature. When he comes to-m orrow I shall ask him about Jonathan; and then,
please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good end. I
used to think I woul d like to practise interviewing; Jonathan’ s friend
on “The Exeter New s” told him that memory was everything in such
work—that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word
spoken, even if you had to refine some  of it afterwards. Here was a
rare interview; I shall try to record it verbatim . It was half-past two o’clock when the knock came. I took my
courage à deux mains  and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the
door, and announced “Dr . Van Helsing.”
I rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium
weight, strongly built, with his shoulder s set back over a broad, deep
chest and a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the
neck. The poise of the head strikes one at once as indicative of
thought and power; the head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large
behind the ears. The face, clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a
large, resolute, mobile mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but
with quick, sensitive nostrils, that seem  to broaden as the big, bushy
brows come down and the mouth tighten s. The forehead is broad and
fine, rising  at first almost straight and then sloping back above two
bumps or ridges wide apart; such a forehead that the reddish hair
cannot possibly tumble over it, but falls naturally back and to the
sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set widely apart, and are quick and
tender or stern with the man’ s moods. He said to me:—
“Mrs. Harker , is it not?” I bowed assent. “That was Miss Mina Murray?” Again I assented. “It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor
dear child  Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead
I come.”
“Sir,” I said, “you could have no better claim on me than that you
were a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra.” And I held out my hand. He took it and said tenderly:—
“Oh, Madam Mina,  I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl
must be good, but I had yet to learn——” He finished his speech
with a courtly bow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me
about, so he at once began:—
“I have read your letters to Miss Lucy . Forgive me, but I had to
begin to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that
you were with her at Whitby . She somet imes kept a diary—you need
not look surprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and
was in imitation of you—and in that diary she traces by inference
certain things to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 138/291saved her. In great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of
your so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember .”
“I can tell you, I think, Dr . Van Helsing, all about it.”
“Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not
always so with young ladies.”
“No, doctor , but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to
you if you like.”
“Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much
favour .” I could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit—I
suppose it is some of the taste of the original apple that remains still
in our mouths—so I handed him the shorthand diary . He took it with
a grateful bow , and said:—
“May I read it?”
“If you wish,” I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it,
and for an instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed. “Oh, you so clever woman!” he said. “I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a man of much thankfulne ss; but see, his wife have all
the good things. And will you not so much honour me and so help
me as to read it for me? Alas! I know  not the shorthand.” By this
time my little joke was over, and I was almost ashamed; so I took the
typewritten copy from my workbasket and handed it to him. “Forgive me,” I said: “I could not help it; but I had been thinking
that it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you
might not have time to wait—not on my account, but because I know
your time must be precious—I have written it out on the typewriter
for you.”
He took it and his eyes glistened. “You are so good,” he said. “And may I read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I
have read.”
“By all means,” I said, “read it over whilst I order lunch; and then
you can ask me questions whilst we eat.” He bowed and settled
himself in a chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in
the papers , whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he
might not be disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking
hurriedly up and down the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and took me by both hands. “Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, “how can I say what I owe to you? This pape r is as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am
dazzle, with so much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light
every time. But that you do not, cannot, comprehend.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Oh, but I am
grateful to you, you so clever woman. Madam”—he said this very
solemnly—“if ever Abraham Van Helsin g can do anything for you or
yours, I trust you will let me know . It will be pleasure and delight if I
may serve you as a friend; as a friend, but all I have ever learned, all
I can ever do, shall be for you and those you love. There are
darknesses in life, and there are lights; you are one of the lights. You
will have happy life and good life, and your husband will be blessed
in you.”
“But, doctor, you praise me too much, and—and you do not know
me.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 139/291“Not know you—I, who am old, and who have studied all my life
men and women; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all
that belon gs to him and all that follow  from him! And I have read

breathes out truth in every line. I, who have read your so sweet letter
to poor Lucy of your marriage and your trust, not know you! Oh,

me of him.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, and is he strong
and hearty?” I saw here an opening to ask him about Jonathan, so I
said:—
“He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins’ s death.” He interrupted:—
“Oh, yes, I know , I know . I have read your last two letters.” I went
on:—
“I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday
last he had a sort of shock.”
“A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What
kind of a shock was it?”
“He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible,
something which led to his brain fever .” And here the whole thing
seemed to overwhel m me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror
which he experienced, the whole fearful  mystery of his diary , and the
fear that has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held
up my hands to him, and implored him to make my husband well
again. He took my hands and raised me up, and made me sit on the
sofa, and sat by me; he held my hand in his, and said to me with, oh,
such infinite sweetness:—
“My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have
not had much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned
to here by my friend John Seward I have known so many good
people and seen such nobility that I feel more than ever—and it has
grown with my adva ncing years—the loneliness of my life. Believe,
me, then, that I come here full of respect for you, and you have given
me hope—hope, not in what I am seekin g of, but that there are good
women still left to make life happy—good women, whose lives and
whose truths may make good lesson for the children that are to be. I
am glad, glad, that I may here be of some use to you; for if your
husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my study and
experience. I promise you that I will gladly do all for him that I can
—all to make his life strong and manly , and your life a happy one. Now you must eat. You are overwrough t and perhaps over-anxious. Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he
like not where he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you
must eat and smile. You have told me all about Lucy , and so now we
shall not speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter to-night, for
I want to think much over what you have told me, and when I have
thought I will ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 140/291me of husband Jonathan’ s trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You
must eat now; afterwards you shall tell me all.”
After lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to
me:—
“And now tell me all about him.” When it came to speaking to this
great learn ed man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak
fool, and Jonathan a madman—that journal is all so strange—and I
hesitated to go on. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had
promised to help, and I trusted him, so I said:—
“Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must
not laugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a
sort of fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me
foolish that I have even half believed some very strange things.” He
reassured me by his manner as well as his words when he said:—
“Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter
regarding which I am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned
not to think little of any one’s belief, no matter how strange it be. I
have tried to keep an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of
life that could close it, but the strange things, the extraordinary
things, the things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane.”
“Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a
weight off my mind .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to
read. It is long, but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my
trouble and Jonathan’ s. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and
all that happened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for
yourself and judge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be
very kind and tell me what you think.”
“I promis e,” he said as I gave him the papers; “I shall in the
morning, so soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I
may.”
“Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to
lunch with us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train,
which will leave you at Paddington before eight.” He was surprised
at my knowledge of the trains off-hand,  but he does not know that I
have made  up all the trains to and from Exeter , so that I may help
Jonathan in case he is in a hurry . So he took the papers with him and went away , and I sit here

wrote down was true. It seems to have  made a new man of me. It
was the doubt as to the reality of the whole thing that knocked me
over. I felt impotent , and in the dark, and distrustful. But, now that I
know , I am not afraid, even of the Count. He has succeeded after all,
then, in his design in getting to London, and it was he I saw. He has
got younger , and how? Van Helsing is the man to unmask him and
hunt him out, if he is anything like what Mina says. We sat late, and
talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and I shall call at the hotel in a
few minutes and bring him over .... He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room
where he was, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder ,
and turned my face round to the light, and said, after a sharp
scrutiny:—
“But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a
shock.” It was so funny to hear my wife called “Madam Mina” by
this kindly , strong-faced old man. I smiled, and said:—
“I was ill, I have  had a shock; but you have cured me already .”
“And how?”
“By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then
everything took a hue of unreality , and I did not know what to trust,
even the evidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I
did not know what to do; and so had only to keep on working in
what had hitherto been the groove of my life. The groove ceased to
avail me, and I mistrusted myself. Doctor , you don’t know what it is6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 142/291to doubt everything, even yourself. No, you don’t; you couldn’ t with
eyebrows like yours.” He seemed pleased, and laughed as he said:—
“So! You are physio gnomist.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I learn more here with each hour. I
am with so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir,
you will pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your
wife.” I would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I
simply nodded and stood silent. “She is one of God’ s women, fashioned by His own hand to show
us men and other women that there is a heaven where we can enter ,
and that its light can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so
little an egoist—and  that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so
sceptical and selfish . And you, sir—I have read all the letters to poor
Miss Lucy , and some of them speak of you, so I know you since
some days from the knowing of others; but I have seen your true self
since last night. You will give me your hand, will you not? And let us
be friends for all our lives.”
We shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made
me quite choky . “And now,” he said, “may I ask you for some more help? I have a
great task to do, and at the beginning it is to know .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"You can help me
here. Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I may ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this
will do.”
“Look here, sir,” I said, “does what you have to do concern the
Count?”
“It does,” he said solemnly . “Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the 10:30 train,
you will not have time to read them; but I shall get the bundle of
papers. You can take them with you and read them in the train.”
After breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting he
said:—
“Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam
Mina too.”
“We shall both come when you will,” I said. I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the
previous night, and while we were talking at the carriage window ,
waiting for the train to start, he was turning them over. His eyes
suddenly seemed to catch somethin g in one of them, “The
Westminster Gazette ”—I knew it by the colour—and he grew quite
white. He read something intently , groaning to himself: “Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon ! so soon!” I do not think he remembered me at
the moment. Just then the whistle blew , and the train moved off. This
recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of the window and waved
his hand, calling out: “Love to Madam Mina; I shall write so soon as
ever I can.”
Dr. Sewar d’s Diary . 26 September .—Truly there is no such thing as finality . Not a
week since I said “Finis,” and yet here I am starting fresh again, or
rather going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no
cause to think of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as
sane as he ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business;6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 143/291and he had just started in the spider line also; so he had not been of
any trouble to me. I had a letter from Arthur , written on Sunday , and
from it I gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey
Morris is with him, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a
bubbling well of good spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from
him I hear that Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old
buoyancy; so as to them all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was
settling down to my work with the enthusiasm which I used to have
for it, so that I might fairly have said that the wound which poor
Lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised. Everything is, however ,
now reopened; and what is to be the end God only knows. I have an
idea that Van Helsin g thinks he knows, too, but he will only let out
enough at a time to whet curiosity . He went to Exeter yesterday , and
stayed there all night. To-day he came back, and almost bounded into
the room at about half-past five o’clock, and thrust last night’ s
“Westminster Gazette” into my hand. “What do you think of that?” he asked as he stood back and folded
his arms. I looked over the paper , for I really did not know what he meant;
but he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children
being decoyed away at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me,
until I reached a passage where it descri bed small punctured wounds
on their throats. An idea struck me, and I looked up. “W ell?” he said. “It is like poor Lucy’ s.”
“And what do you make of it?”
“Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that
injured her has injured them.” I did not quite understand his answer:
—
“That is true indirectly , but not directly .”
“How do you mean, Professor?” I asked . I was a little inclined to
take his seriousness lightly—for , after all, four days of rest and
freedom from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one’s
spirits—but when I saw his face, it sobered me. Never , even in the
midst of our despair about poor Lucy , had he looked more stern. “Tell me!”  I said. “I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to
think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture.”
“Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion
as to what  poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only
by events, but by me?”
“Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of
blood.”
“And how the blood lost or waste?” I shook my head. He stepped
over and sat down beside me, and went on:—
“You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is
bold; but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor
your ears hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of
account to you. Do you not think that there are things which you
cannot understand, and yet which are; that some people see things
that others cannot? But there are things old and new which must not
be contem plate by men’ s eyes, because they know—or think they
know—some things  which other men have told them. Ah, it is the6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 144/291fault of our science that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not,
then it says there is nothing to explain. But yet we see around us
every day the grow th of new beliefs, which think themselves new;
and which are yet but the old, which pretend to be young—like the
fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do not believe in
corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Nor in astral
bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in hypnotism
——”
“Yes,” I said. “Charcot has proved that pretty well.” He smiled as
he went on: “Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then
you understand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great
Charcot—alas that he is no more!—into  the very soul of the patient
that he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that you
simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion
be a blank? No?","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Then tell me—for I am student of the brain—how
you accept the hypn otism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell
you, my friend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science
which would have been deemed unholy by the very men who
discovered electrici ty—who would themselves not so long before
have been burned as wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that Methuselah lived nine hundred years, and ‘Old Parr’
one hundred and sixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy , with four men’ s
blood in her poor veins, could not live even one day? For, had she
live one more day, we could have save her. Do you know all the
mystery of life and death? Do you know the altogether of
comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the qualities of brutes
are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell me why, when other
spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived for centuries in
the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew , till, on
descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps? Can you
tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that
come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry
their veins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats
which hang on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as
like giant nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck,
because that it is hot, flit down on them, and then—and then in the
morning are found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?”
“Good God, Professor!” I said, starting  up. “Do you mean to tell
me that Lucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here
in London in the nineteenth century?” He waved his hand for silence,
and went on:—
“Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than
generations of men; why the elephant goes on and on till he have
seen dyna sties; and why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or
dog or other complaint? Can you tell me why men believe in all ages
and places that there are some few who live on always if they be
permit; that there are men and women who cannot die? We all know
—because science has vouched for the fact—that there have been
toads shut up in rocks for thousands of years, shut in one so small
hole that only hold him since the youth of the world. Can you tell me
how the Indian fakir can make himself to die and have been buried,
and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the corn reaped and
be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men come and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 145/291take away  the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian fakir, not
dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?” Here I
interrupted him. I was getting bewilde red; he so crowded on my
mind his list of nature’ s eccentricities and possible impossibilities
that my imagination was getting fired.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I had a dim idea that he was
teaching me some lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at
Amsterdam; but he used then to tell me the thing, so that I could
have the object of thought in mind all the time. But now I was
without this help, yet I wanted to follow him, so I said:—
“Professor , let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so
that I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going
in my mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one,
follows an idea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a
mist, jumping from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to
move on without knowing where I am going.”
“That is good image ,” he said. “Well, I shall tell you. My thesis is
this: I want you to believe.”
“To believe what?”
“To believe in thing s that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard
once of an American who so defined faith: ‘that faculty which
enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue.’  For one, I
follow that man. He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not
let a little bit of truth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock
does a railway truck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep
him, and we value him; but all the same we must not let him think
himself all the truth in the universe.”
“Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the
receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter . Do I read
your lesson aright?”
“Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Now
that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to
understand. You think then that those so small holes in the children’ s
throats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?”
“I suppose so.” He stood up and said solemnly:—
“Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
but alas!,"Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"no. It is
worse, far , far worse.”
“In God’ s name, Professor Van Helsin g, what do you mean?” I
cried. He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair , and placed
his elbows  on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:
—
“They were made by Miss Lucy!”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 146/291CHAPTER XV
DR. SEWARD’S DIARY—continued. FOR a while sheer anger  mastered me; it was as if he had during her
life struck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I
said to him:—
“Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?” He raised his head and looked at
me, and somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. “Would I were!” he said. “Madness were easy to bear compared with
truth like this. Oh, my friend, why, think you, did I go so far round,
why take so long to tell you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate
you and have hated you all my life? Was it because I wished to give
you pain? Was it that I wanted, now so late, revenge for that time
when you saved my life, and from a fearful death? Ah no!”
“Forgive me,” said I. He went on:—
“My friend , it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to
you, for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do
not expect  you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract
truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always
believed the ‘no’ of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a concrete
truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy . To-night I go to prove it.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Dare
you come with me?”
This stagg ered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth;
Byron excepted from the category , jealousy . “And prove the very truth he most abhorred.”
He saw my hesitation, and spoke:—
“The logic  is simple, no madman’ s logic this time, jumping from
tussock to tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be
relief; at worst it will not harm.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"If it be true! Ah, there is the dread;
yet very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come, I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see
that child in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where
the papers say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours
since you were in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see
his case, if he will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but
only that we wish to learn.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"And then——”
“And then?” He took a key from his pocket and held it up. “And
then we spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy
lies. This is the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man
to give to Arthur .” My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was
some fearful ordeal before us. I could  do nothing, however , so I
plucked up what heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as
the afternoon was passing.... We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food,
and altoge ther was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from
its throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 147/291similarity to those which had been on Lucy’ s throat. They were
smaller , and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent
to what he attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a
bite of some animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was
inclined to think that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on
the northern heights of London. “Out of so many harmless ones,” he
said, “there may be some wild specimen from the South of a more
malignant species. Some sailor may have brought one home, and it
managed to escape; or even from the Zoölogical Gardens a young
one may have got loose, or one be bred there from a vampire. These
things do occur , you know . Only ten days ago a wolf got out, and
was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a week after, the
children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath
and in every alley in the place until this ‘bloofer lady’  scare came
along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even this
poor little mite, when he woke up to-day , asked the nurse if he might
go away . When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he
wanted to play with the ‘bloofer lady .’”
“I hope,” said Van Helsing, “that when you are sending the child
home you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These
fancies to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain
out another night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I
suppose you will not let it away for some days?”
“Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not
healed.”
Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on,
and the sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw
how dark it was, he said:—
“There is no hurry .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek
somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way .”
We dined at “Jack Straw’ s Castle” along with a little crowd of
bicyclists and others who were genially  noisy . About ten o’clock we
started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps
made the darkness greater when we were once outside their
individual radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we
were to go, for he went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in
quite a mixup as to locality . As we went further , we met fewer and
fewer people, till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met
even the patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round. At
last we reached the wall of the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty—for it was very dark, and the whole place
seemed so strange to us—we found  the Westenra tomb. The
Professor took the key, opened the creaky door, and standing back,
politely , but quite unconsciously , motioned me to precede him. There
was a delicious irony in the offer, in the courtliness of giving
preference on such a ghastly occasion. My companion followed me
quickly , and cautiously drew the door to, after carefully ascertaining
that the lock was a falling, and not a spring, one. In the latter case we
should have been in a bad plight.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Then he fumbled in his bag, and
taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle, proceeded to make a
light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed with fresh
flowers, had looked grim and gruesome  enough; but now, some days
afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 148/291turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the
beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-
discoloured stone, and dust-encrusted mortar , and rusty , dank iron,
and tarnis hed brass, and clouded silver -plating gave back the feeble
glimmer of a candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than
could have been imagined. It conveyed  irresistibly the idea that life
—animal life—was not the only thing which could pass away . Van Helsing went about his work systematically . Holding his
candle so that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that
the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched
the metal, he made assurance of Lucy’ s coffin. Another search in his
bag, and he took out a turnscrew . “What are you going to do?” I asked. “To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.” Straightway he
began taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing
the casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It
seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to
have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually
took hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: “You shall see,” and
again fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw . Striking the
turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made
me wince, he made a small hole, which was, however , big enough to
admit the point of the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the
week-old corpse. We doctors, who have had to study our dangers,
have to become accustomed to such things, and I drew back towards
the door. But the Professor never stopped for a moment; he sawed
down a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin, and then
across, and down the other side. Taking the edge of the loose flange,
he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin, and holding up the
candle into the aperture, motioned to me to look. I drew near and looked. The cof fin was empty . It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable
shock, but Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than
ever of his ground, and so emboldened  to proceed in his task. “Are
you satisfied now , friend John?” he asked. I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within
me as I answered him:—
“I am satisfied that Lucy’ s body is not in that coffin; but that only
proves one thing.”
“And what is that, friend John?”
“That it is not there.”
“That is good logic,”  he said, “so far as it goes. But how do you—
how can you—account for it not being there?”
“Perhaps a body-snatcher ,” I suggested. “Some of the undertaker ’s
people may have stolen it.” I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it
was the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"“Ah well!” he said, “we must have more proof. Come with me.”
He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and
placed them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also
in the bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed
the door and locked it. He handed me the key, saying: “Will you6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 149/291keep it? You had better be assured.” I laughed—it was not a very
cheerful laugh, I am bound to say—as I motioned him to keep it. “A
key is nothing,” I said; “there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is
not difficult to pick a lock of that kind.” He said nothing, but put the
key in his pocket. Then he told me to watch at one side of the
churchyard whilst he would watch at the other . I took up my place
behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark figure move until the
intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight. It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a
distant clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was
chilled and unnerved , and angry with the Professor for taking me on
such an errand and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too
sleepy to be keenly observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my
trust so altogether I had a dreary , miserable time. Suddenly , as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a
white streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the
churchyard farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass
moved from the Professor ’s side of the ground, and hurriedly went
towards it. Then I too moved; but I had to go round headstones and
railed-of f tombs, and I stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast,
and somew here far off an early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a
line of scattered juniper -trees, which marked the pathway to the
church, a white, dim figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The
tomb itself was hidden by trees, and I could not see where the figure
disappeared. I heard the rustle of actual  movement where I had first
seen the white figur e, and coming over, found the Professor holding
in his arms a tiny child. When he saw me he held it out to me, and
said:—
“Are you satisfied now?”
“No,” I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive. “Do you not see the child?”
“Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?” I
asked. “We shall see,” said the Professor , and with one impulse we took
our way out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child. When we had got some little distance away , we went into a clump
of trees, and struck a match, and looked  at the child’ s throat. It was
without a scratch or scar of any kind. “Was I right?” I asked triumphantly . “We were just in time,” said the Professor thankfully . We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so
consulted about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should
have to give some account of our movements during the night; at
least, we should have had to make some statement as to how we had
come to find the child. So finally we decided that we would take it to
the Heath, and when we heard a police man coming, would leave it
where he could not fail to find it; we would then seek our way home
as quickly as we could. All fell out well. At the edge of Hampstead
Heath we heard a policeman’ s heavy tramp, and laying the child on
the pathwa y, we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his
lantern to and fro. We heard his excla mation of astonishment, and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 150/291then we went away silently . By good chance we got a cab near the
“Spaniards,” and drove to town. I cannot sleep, so I make this entry . But I must try to get a few
hours’  sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I
shall go with him on another expedition. 27 September .—It was two o’clock before we found a suitable
opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all
completed, and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken
themselves lazily away , when, looking carefully from behind a
clump of alder -trees , we saw the sexton lock the gate after him. We
knew then that we were safe till morn ing did we desire it; but the
Professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at
most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the reality of things, in which
any effort of imagination seemed out of place; and I realised
distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our
unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless. Outrageous as
it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead nearly a week
were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb
again, when we knew, from the eviden ce of our own eyesight, that
the coffin was empt y. I shrugged my shoulders, however , and rested
silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road, no
matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and
again courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so
gruesome as last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when
the sunshine streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy’ s coffin,
and I followed. He bent over and again forced back the leaden
flange; and then a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me. There lay Lucy , seemingly just as we had seen her the night before
her funera l. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever;
and I could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay
redder than before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom. “Is this a juggle?” I said to him. “Are you convinced now?” said the Professor in response, and as
he spoke he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder ,
pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth. “See,” he went on, “see, they are even sharper than before. With
this and this”—and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below
it—“the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend
John?” Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I could
not accept  such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an
attempt to argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:
—
“She may have been placed here since last night.”
“Indeed? That is so, and by whom?”
“I do not know . Some one has done it.”
“And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time
would not look so.” I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van
Helsing did not seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed
neither chagrin nor triumph. He was looking intently at the face of
the dead woman, raising the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 151/291once more  opening the lips and examining the teeth. Then he turned
to me and said:—
“Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here
is some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the
vampire when she was in a trance, sleep-walking—oh, you start; you
do not know that, friend John, but you shall know it all later—and in
trance could he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and
in trance she is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other . Usually when the Un-Dead sleep at home”—as he spoke he made a
comprehensive swee p of his arm to designate what to a vampire was
“home”—“their face show what they are, but this so sweet that was
when she not Un-Dead she go back to the nothings of the common
dead. Ther e is no malign there, see, and so it make hard that I must
kill her in her sleep.” This turned my blood cold, and it began to
dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing’ s theories; but if she
were really dead, what was there of terror in the idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in my face, for he
said almost joyously:—
“Ah, you believe now?”
I answered: “Do not press me too hard all at once.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I am willing to
accept. How will you do this bloody work?”
“I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall
drive a stake throug h her body .” It made me shudder to think of so
mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the
feeling was not so strong as I had expected.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I was, in fact, beginning
to shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van
Helsing called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all
subjective, or all objective? I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood
as if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag
with a snap, and said:—
“I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is
best. If I did simpl y follow my inclining I would do now, at this
moment, what is to be done; but there are other things to follow , and
things that are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not
know . This is simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of
time; and to act now would be to take danger from her for ever. But
then we may have to want Arthur , and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the wounds on Lucy’ s throat, and saw the wounds
so similar on the child’ s at the hospital ; if you, who saw the coffin
empty last night and full to-day with a woman who have not change
only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week, after she
die—if you know of this and know of the white figure last night that
brought the child to the churchyard, and yet of your own senses you
did not believe, how, then, can I expect Arthur , who know none of
those things, to believe? He doubted me when I took him from her
kiss when she was dying.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I know he has forgiven me because in
some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say good-
bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea
this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have
killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that
have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy
always. Yet he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

paint his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and
again, he will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved
was, after all, an Un-Dead. No!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I told him once, and since then I
learn much. Now , since I know it is all true, a hundred thousand
times more do I know that he must pass through the bitter waters to
reach the sweet. He, poor fellow , must have one hour that will make
the very face of heaven grow black to him; then we can act for good
all round and send him peace. My mind  is made up.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Let us go. You
return home for to-night to your asylum, and see that all be well. As
for me, I shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own
way. To-morrow night you will come to me to the Berkeley Hotel at
ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too, and also that so
fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later we shall all
have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly and there dine,
for I must be back here before the sun set.”
So we locked the tomb and came away , and got over the wall of
the church yard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to
Piccadilly . Note left by V an Helsing in his portmanteau, Berkeley Hotel dir ected

“27 September . “Friend John,—
“I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch in
that church yard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy , shall not
leave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager . Therefore I shall fix some things she like not—garlic and a crucifix
—and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead, and
will heed. Moreover , these are only to prevent her coming out; they
may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is
desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it
may be. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the
sunrise, and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For
Miss Lucy  or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is
there that she is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb
and find shelter . He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and
from the way that all along he have fooled us when he played with us
for Miss Lucy’ s life, and we lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are
strong. He have always the strength in his hand of twenty men; even
we four who gave our strength to Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf and I know not what. So if it be
that he come thither on this night he shall find me; but none other
shall—until it be too late. But it may be that he will not attempt the
place. There is no reason why he should; his hunting ground is more
full of game than the churchyard where the Un-Dead woman sleep,
and the one old man watch. “Therefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this,
the diaries of Harke r and the rest, and read them, and then find this
great Un-D ead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a
stake through it, so that the world may rest from him. “If it be so, farewell.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

Dr. Sewar d’s Diary . 28 September .—It is wonderful what a good night’ s sleep will do
for one. Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing’ s
monstrous ideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as
outrages on commo n sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I
wonder if his mind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely
there must be some  rational explanatio n of all these mysterious
things. Is it possible that the Professor can have done it himself? He
is so abno rmally clever that if he went off his head he would carry
out his intent with regard to some fixed idea in a wonderful way. I
am loath to think it, and indeed it would be almost as great a marvel
as the other to find that Van Helsing was mad; but anyhow I shall
watch him carefully . I may get some light on the mystery . 29 September , morning.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
".... Last night, at a little before ten o’clock,
Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing’ s room; he told us all that
he wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur , as if
all our wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped
we would all come  with him too, “for,” he said, “there is a grave
duty to be done there. You were doubt less surprised at my letter?”
This query was directly addressed to Lord Godalming. “I was.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble
around my house of late that I could do without any more.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I have
been curious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over;
but the more we talked, the more puzzl ed we got, till now I can say
for myself that I’m about up a tree as to any meaning about
anything.”
“Me too,” said Quincey Morris laconically . “Oh,” said the Professor , “then you are nearer the beginning, both
of you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before
he can even get so far as to begin.”
It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting
frame of mind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other
two, he said with intense gravity:—
“I want your permis sion to do what I think good this night. It is, I
know , much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do
you will know , and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that
you promise me in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be
angry with me for a time—I must not disguise from myself the
possibility that such may be—you shall not blame yourselves for
anything.”
“That’ s frank anyhow ,” broke in Quin cey. “I’ll answer for the
Professor . I don’t quite see his drift, but I swear he’s honest; and
that’s good enough for me.”
“I thank you, sir,” said Van Helsing proudly . “I have done myself
the hono ur of counting you one trusting friend, and such
endorsement is dear to me.” He held out a hand, which Quincey
took. Then Arthur spoke out:—6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 154/291“Dr. Van Helsing, I don’t quite like to ‘buy a pig in a poke,’  as
they say in Scotland, and if it be anythi ng in which my honour as a
gentleman or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make
such a promise. If you can assure me that what you intend does not
violate either of these two, then I give my consent at once; though
for the life of me, I cannot understand what you are driving at.”
“I accept your limita tion,” said Van Helsing, “and all I ask of you
is that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will
first consi der it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your
reservations.”
“Agreed!” said Arthur; “that is only fair. And now that the
pourparlers  are over , may I ask what it is we are to do?”
“I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the
churchyard at Kingstead.”
Arthur ’s face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:—
“Where poor Lucy is buried?” The Professor bowed. Arthur went
on: “And when there?”
“To enter the tomb!” Arthur stood up. “Professor , are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me, I see that you are in earnest.” He sat down again, but I
could see that he sat firmly and proudly , as one who is on his dignity . There was silence until he asked again:—
“And when in the tomb?”
“To open the cof fin.”
“This is too much!” he said, angrily rising again. “I am willing to
be patien t in all things that are reasonable; but in this—this
desecration of the grave—of one who— —” He fairly choked with
indignation. The Professor looked pityingly at him. “If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend,” he said, “God
knows I would. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or
later, and for ever , the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!”
Arthur looked up with set white face and said:—
“Take care, sir , take care!”
“Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?” said Van
Helsing. “And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I go on?”
“That’ s fair enough,” broke in Morris. After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an ef fort:—
“Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong
to her . But if she be not dead——”
Arthur jumped to his feet. “Good God!” he cried. “What do you mean? Has there been any
mistake; has she been buried alive?” He groaned in anguish that not
even hope could soften. “I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no
further than to say that she might be Un-Dead.”
“Un-Dead! Not alive!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare,
or what is it?”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 155/291“There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by
age they may solve  only in part. Believe me, we are now on the
verge of one.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"But I have not done. May I cut off the head of dead
Miss Lucy?”
“Heavens and earth, no!” cried Arthur in a storm of passion. “Not
for the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body . Dr. Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that
you should torture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you
should want to cast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad to
speak such things, or am I mad to listen  to them? Don’ t dare to think
more of such a desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything
you do. I have a duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and,
by God, I shall do it!”
Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated,
and said, gravely and sternly:—
“My Lord  Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a
duty to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask
you now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if
when later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its
fulfilment even than I am, then—then I shall do my duty, whatever it
may seem  to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship’ s wishes I
shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when
and where you will.” His voice broke a little, and he went on with a
voice full of pity:—
“But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long
life of acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which
sometimes did wring my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as
now. Believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind
towards me, one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour,
for I woul d do what a man can to save you from sorrow . Just think. For why should I give myself so much of labour and so much of
sorrow? I have come here from my own land to do what I can of
good; at the first to please my friend John, and then to help a sweet
young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her—I am ashamed to
say so much, but I say it in kindness—I gave what you gave; the
blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her lover , but
only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights and days—
before death, after death; and if my death can do her good even now,
when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely .” He said this
with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected by it. He took the old man’ s hand and said in a broken voice:—
“Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I canno t understand; but at least I
shall go with you and wait.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

DR. SEWARD’S DIARY—continued
IT was just a quarter before twelve o’clock when we got into the
churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional
gleams of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that
scudded across the sky. We all kept somehow close together , with
Van Helsing slightly in front as he led the way. When we had come
close to the tomb I looked well at Arthur , for I feared that the
proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset
him; but he bore himself well. I took it that the very mystery of the
proceeding was in some way a counteractant to his grief. The
Professor unlocked the door, and seeing  a natural hesitation amongst
us for various reason s, solved the difficulty by entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed  the door. He then lit a dark
lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped forward
hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:—
“You were  with me here yesterday . Was the body of Miss Lucy in
that cof fin?”
“It was.” The Professor turned to the rest saying:—
“You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.”
He took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he
stepped forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden
coffin, or, at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in
the lead, the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly
fell away again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was
still silent. Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all
looked in and recoiled. The cof fin was empty! For severa l minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken
by Quincey Morris:—
“Professor , I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn’ t
ask such a thing ordinarily—I wouldn’ t so dishonour you as to imply
a doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or
dishonour . Is this your doing?”
“I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed
nor touche d her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend
Seward and I came here—with good purpose, believe me. I opened
that coffin, which was then sealed up, and we found it, as now,
empty . We then waited, and saw something white come through the
trees. The next day we came here in day-time, and she lay there. Did
she not, friend John?”
“Yes.”
“That night we were just in time. One more so small child was
missing, and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 157/291can move. I waited  here all the night till the sun rose, but I saw
nothing. It was most probable that it was because I had laid over the
clamps of those doors garlic, which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and
other thing s which they shun. Last night there was no exodus, so to-
night before the sundown I took away  my garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty . But bear with me.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"So far there
is much that is strange. Wait you with me outside, unseen and
unheard, and things  much stranger are yet to be. So”—here he shut
the dark slide of his lantern—“now to the outside.” He opened the
door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the door behind
him. Oh!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of
that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the
passing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds
crossing and passing—like the gladness and sorrow of a man’ s life;
how sweet it was to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death
and decay; how humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond
the hill, and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a
great city. Each in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur
was silent, and was, I could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the
inner meaning of the mystery . I was myself tolerably patient, and
half inclined again to throw aside doubt  and to accept Van Helsing’ s
conclusions. Quincey Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man
who accepts all things, and accepts them  in the spirit of cool bravery ,
with hazard of all he has to stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut
himself a good-sized  plug of tobacco and began to chew . As to Van
Helsing, he was employed in a definite way. First he took from his
bag a mass of what looked like thin, wafer -like biscuit, which was
carefully rolled up in a white napkin; next he took out a double-
handful of some whitish stuff, like dough or putty . He crumbled the
wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands. This he
then took, and rolling it into thin strips , began to lay them into the
crevices between the door and its setting in the tomb. I was
somewhat puzzled at this, and being close, asked him what it was
that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near also, as they too
were curious. He answered:—
“I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter .”
“And is that stuff you have put there  going to do it?” asked
Quincey . “Great Scott! Is this a game?”
“It is.”
“What is that which you are using?” This time the question was by
Arthur . Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:—
“The Host . I brought it from Amsterdam . I have an Indulgence.” It
was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt
individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the
Professor ’s, a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred
of things, it was impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took
the places assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the
sight of any one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur . I
had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching
horror; and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs,
felt my heart sink within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white;
never did cypress, or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 158/291funereal gloom; never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously;
never did bough creak so mysteriously; and never did the far-away
howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night. There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then
from the Professor a keen “S-s-s-s!” He pointed; and far down the
avenue of yews we saw a white figure advance—a dim white figure,
which held something dark at its breas t. The figure stopped, and at
the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving
clouds and showed in startling prominence a dark-haired woman,
dressed in the cerements of the grave. We could not see the face, for
it was bent down over what we saw to be a fair-haired child. There
was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a child gives in sleep, or a
dog as it lies before  the fire and dreams. We were starting forward,
but the Professor ’s warning hand, seen by us as he stood behind a
yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the white figure
moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see clearly ,
and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice, and I
could hear the gasp of Arthur , as we recognised the features of Lucy
Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was
turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty , and the purity to voluptuous
wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture,
we all advanced too; the four of us range d in a line before the door of
the tomb. Van Helsi ng raised his lanter n and drew the slide; by the
concentrated light that fell on Lucy’ s face we could see that the lips
were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over
her chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe. We shuddered with horror . I could see by the tremulous light that
even Van Helsing’ s iron nerve had failed . Arthur was next to me, and
if I had not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen. When Lucy—I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it
bore her shape—saw  us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a
cat gives when taken  unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy’ s
eyes in form and colour; but Lucy’ s eyes unclean and full of hell-
fire, instead of the pure, gentle orbs we knew . At that moment the
remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be
killed, I could have done it with savage delight. As she looked, her
eyes blaze d with unholy light, and the face became wreathed with a
voluptuous smile. Oh, God, how it made  me shudder to see it! With a
careless motion, she flung to the ground, callous as a devil, the child
that up to now she had clutched strenuo usly to her breast, growling
over it as a dog growls over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and
lay there moaning. There was a cold-b loodedness in the act which
wrung a groan from Arthur; when she advanced to him with
outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in
his hands. She still advanced, however , and with a languorous, voluptuous
grace, said:—
“Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"My
arms are hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together . Come, my
husband, come!”
There was something diabolically sweet in her tones—something
of the tingling of glass when struck—which rang through the brains
even of us who heard the words address ed to another . As for Arthur ,6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 159/291he seemed under a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened
wide his arms. She was leaping for them , when Van Helsing sprang
forward and held between them his little golden crucifix. She
recoiled from it, and, with a suddenly distorted face, full of rage,
dashed past him as if to enter the tomb. When within a foot or two of the door, however , she stopped, as if
arrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was
shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had
now no quiver from Van Helsing’ s iron nerves. Never did I see such
baffled malice on a face; and never , I trust, shall such ever be seen
again by mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes
seemed to throw out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as
though the folds of the flesh were the coils of Medusa’ s snakes, and
the lovely, blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the
passion masks of the Greeks and Japane se. If ever a face meant death
—if looks could kill—we saw it at that moment. And so for full half a minute, which  seemed an eternity , she
remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her
means of entry . Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:—
“Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?”
Arthur threw himse lf on his knees, and hid his face in his hands,
as he answered:—
“Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like
this ever any more;” and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I
simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could
hear the click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down;
coming close to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some
of the sacred emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in
horrified amazement as we saw, when  he stood back, the woman,
with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own, pass in
through the interstice where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the Professor calmly
restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door . When this was done, he lifted the child and said:
“Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow . There
is a funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton
lock the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like
this of to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-
morrow night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police
will find him, as on the other night; and then to home.” Coming
close to Arthur , he said:—
“My frien d Arthur , you have had a sore trial; but after, when you
look back , you will see how it was necessary . You are now in the
bitter wate rs, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God,
have passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not
mourn overmuch. Till then I shall not ask you to for give me.”
Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer
each other on the way. We had left the child in safety , and were tired;
so we all slept with more or less reality of sleep. 6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 160/29129 September , night. —A little before twelve o’clock we three—
Arthur , Quincey Morris, and myself—called for the Professor . It was
odd to notice that by common consen t we had all put on black
clothes. Of course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning,
but the rest of us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by
half-past one, and strolled about, keeping out of official observation,
so that when the gravediggers had completed their task and the
sexton under the belief that every one had gone, had locked the gate,
we had the place all to ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little
black bag, had with him a long leather one, something like a
cricketing bag; it was manifestly of fair weight. When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die
out up the road, we silently , and as if by ordered intention, followed
the Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered,
closing it behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he
lit, and also two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by
melting their own ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light
sufficient to work by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy’ s coffin
we all looked—Arthur trembling like an aspen—and saw that the
body lay there in all its death-beauty . But there was no love in my
own heart, nothing but loathing for the foul Thing which had taken
Lucy’ s shape without her soul. I could see even Arthur ’s face grow
hard as he looked. Presently he said to Van Helsing:—
“Is this really Lucy’ s body , or only a demon in her shape?”
“It is her body , and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her
as she was, and is.”
She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed
teeth, the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth—which it made one
shudder to see—the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance,
seeming like a devil ish mockery of Lucy’ s sweet purity . Van Helsing,
with his usual methodicalness, began taking the various contents
from his bag and placing them ready for use. First he took out a
soldering iron and some plumbing solde r, and then a small oil-lamp,
which gave out, when lit in a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at
fierce heat with a blue flame; then his operating knives, which he
placed to hand; and last a round woode n stake, some two and a half
or three inches thick and about three feet long. One end of it was
hardened by charrin g in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer , such as in households is used
in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To me, a doctor ’s
preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing, but
the effect of these things on both Arthu r and Quincey was to cause
them a sort of consternation. They both, however , kept their courage,
and remained silent and quiet.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"When all was ready , Van Helsing said:—
“Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore
and experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the
powers of the Un-D ead. When they become such, there comes with
the change the curse  of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on
age after age addin g new victims and multiplying the evils of the
world; for all that die from the preyin g of the Un-Dead becomes
themselves Un-Dead , and prey on their kind. And so the circle goes
on ever widening, like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 161/291water . Friend Arthu r, if you had met that kiss which you know of
before poor Lucy die; or again, last night when you open your arms
to her, you would  in time, when you had died, have become
nosferatu , as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would all time make
more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror . The career
of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those children whose
blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if she live on,
Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her power
over them  they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that so
wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny wounds
of the throats disappear , and they go back to their plays unknowing
ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when this now
Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor lady
whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by
night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she
shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will
be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free. To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better
right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night
when sleep is not: ‘It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it was
the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would
herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?’  Tell me if there be
such a one amongst us?”
We all looked at Arthur . He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite
kindness which suggested that his shou ld be the hand which would
restore Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy , memory; he stepped
forward and said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was
as pale as snow:—
“My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me what I am to do, and I shall not falter!” Van Helsing laid a
hand on his shoulder , and said:—
“Brave lad! A moment’ s courage, and it is done. This stake must
be driven through her. It will be a fearfu l ordeal—be not deceived in
that—but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more
than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emer ge as
though you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have
begun. Only think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that
we pray for you all the time.”
“Go on,” said Arthur hoarsely . “Tell me what I am to do.”
“Take this stake in your left hand, ready  to place the point over the
heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer
for the dead—I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others
shall follo w—strike in God’ s name, that so all may be well with the
dead that we love and that the Un-Dead pass away .”
Arthur took the stake and the hammer , and when once his mind
was set on action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van
Helsing opened his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I
followed as well as we could. Arthur placed the point over the heart,
and as I looked I could see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck
with all his might. The Thing  in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling
screech came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 162/291and twisted in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed
together till the lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a
crimson foam. But Arthur never faltered. He looked like a figure of
Thor as his untrembling arm rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper
the mercy-bearing stake, whilst the blood from the pierced heart
welled and spurted up around it. His face was set, and high duty
seemed to shine through it; the sight of it gave us courage so that our
voices seemed to ring through the little vault. And then the writhin g and quivering of the body became less, and
the teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver . Finally it lay still.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"The terrible task was over . The hamm er fell from Arthur ’s hand. He reeled and would have
fallen had we not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from
his forehead, and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been
an awful strain on him; and had he not been forced to his task by
more than human considerations he could never have gone through
with it. For a few minutes we were so taken up with him that we did
not look towards the coffin. When we did, however , a murmur of
startled surprise ran from one to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly
that Arthur rose, for he had been seated on the ground, and came and
looked too; and then a glad, strange light broke over his face and
dispelled altogether the gloom of horror that lay upon it. There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so
dreaded and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was
yielded as a privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we
had seen her in her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and
purity . True that there were there, as we had seen them in life, the
traces of care and pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for
they mark ed her truth to what we knew . One and all we felt that the
holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted face and form was
only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that was to reign for
ever. Van Helsin g came and laid his hand on Arthur ’s shoulder , and said
to him:—
“And now , Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not for given?”
The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man’ s
hand in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:—
“Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her
soul again, and me peace.” He put his hands on the Professor ’s
shoulder , and laying  his head on his breast, cried for a while silently ,
whilst we stood unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing
said to him:—
“And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you
will, as she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a
grinning devil now—not any more a foul Thing for all eternity . No
longer she is the devil’ s Un-Dead. She is God’ s true dead, whose
soul is with Him!”
Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out
of the tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving
the point of it in the body . Then we cut off the head and filled the
mouth with garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 163/291coffin-lid, and gathering up our belong ings, came away . When the
Professor locked the door he gave the key to Arthur . Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone , and the birds sang, and it
seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was
gladness and mirth and peace everyw here, for we were at rest
ourselves on one account, and we were  glad, though it was with a
tempered joy . Before we moved away Van Helsing said:—
“Now , my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most
harrowing to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out
the author of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues
which we can follow ; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is
danger in it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to
believe, all of us—is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do we not promise to go on to the bitter end?”
Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then
said the Professor as we moved of f:—
“Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at
seven of the clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two
that you know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show
and our plans unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I
have much  to consult about, and you can help me. To-night I leave
for Amsterdam, but shall return to-mor row night. And then begins
our great quest.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"But first I shall have much to say, so that you may
know what is to do and to dread. Then our promise shall be made to
each other anew; for there is a terrible task before us, and once our
feet are on the ploughshare we must not draw back.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

DR. SEWARD’S DIARY—continued
WHEN we arriv ed at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a
telegram waiting for him:—
“Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Important news.—
M    H      .”
The Professor was delighted. “Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina,”
he said, “pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She
must go to your house, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her en route, so that she may be prepared.”
When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told
me of a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a
typewritten copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker ’s diary at Whitby . “Take these,” he said, “and study them  well. When I have returned
you will be master of all the facts, and we can then better enter on
our inquisition. Keep them safe, for there is in them much of
treasure. You will need all your faith, even you who have had such
an experience as that of to-day . What is here told,” he laid his hand
heavily and gravely on the packet of papers as he spoke, “may be the
beginning of the end to you and me and many another; or it may
sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk the earth. Read all, I pray
you, with the open mind; and if you can add in any way to the story
here told do so, for it is all-important. You have kept diary of all
these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we shall go through
all these together when we meet.” He then made ready for his
departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. I took my
way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before the
train came in. The crow d melted away , after the bustling fashion common to
arrival platforms; and I was beginning  to feel uneasy , lest I might
miss my guest, when  a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to
me, and, after a quick glance, said: “Dr . Seward, is it not?”
“And you are Mrs. Harker!” I answered at once; whereupon she
held out her hand. “I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but——” She
stopped suddenly , and a quick blush overspread her face. The blush  that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at
ease, for it was a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which
included a typewriter , and we took the Under ground to Fenchurch
Street, after I had sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-
room and bedroom prepared at once for Mrs. Harker .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"In due time we arrived. She knew , of course, that the place was a
lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a
shudder when we entered. She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my
study , as she had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 165/291phonograph diary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance
of looking at the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they
lie open before me. I must get her interested in something, so that I
may have an opportunity of reading them. She does not know how
precious time is, or what a task we have in hand. I must be careful
not to frighten her . Here she is! Mina Harker ’s Journal. 29 September .—After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward’ s study . At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard
him talkin g with some one. As, howev er, he had pressed me to be
quick, I knocked at the door, and on his calling out, “Come in,” I
entered. To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite
alone, and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from
the description to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was
much interested. “I hope I did not keep you waiting,” I said; “but I stayed at the
door as I heard you talking, and thoug ht there was some one with
you.”
“Oh,” he replied with a smile, “I was only entering my diary .”
“Your diary?” I asked him in surprise. “Yes,” he answered . “I keep it in this.” As he spoke he laid his
hand on the phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:
—
“Why , this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?”
“Certainly ,” he replied with alacrity , and stood up to put it in train
for speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his
face. “The fact is,” he began awkwardly , “I only keep my diary in it;
and as it is entirely—almost entirely—about my cases, it may be
awkward—that is, I mean——” He stopped, and I tried to help him
out of his embarrassment:—
“You helped to atten d dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she
died; for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very,
very dear to me.”
To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:
—
“Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!”
“Why not?” I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming
over me. Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to
invent an excuse. At length he stammered out:—
“You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the
diary .” Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and
he said with unconscious simplicity , in a different voice, and with the
naïveté of a child: “That’ s quite true, upon my honour . Honest
Indian!” I could not but smile, at which he grimaced. “I gave myself
away that time!” he said. “But do you know that, although I have
kept the diary for months past, it neve r once struck me how I was
going to find any particular part of it in case I wanted to look it up?”
By this time my mind was made up that the diary of a doctor who6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 166/291attended Lucy might have something to add to the sum of our
knowledge of that terrible Being, and I said boldly:—
“Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on
my typewriter .” He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:—
“No! no!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"no! For all the world, I wouldn’ t let you know that
terrible story!”
Then it was terribl e; my intuition was right! For a moment I
thought, and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for
something or some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of
typewriting on the table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and,
without his thinking, followed their direction. As they saw the parcel
he realised my meaning. “You do not know me,” I said. “When you have read those papers
—my own diary and my husband’ s also, which I have typed—you
will know me bette r. I have not faltered in giving every thought of
my own heart in this cause; but, of course, you do not know me—
yet; and I must not expect you to trust me so far .”
He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right
about him. He stood up and opened a large drawer , in which were
arranged in order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered
with dark wax, and said:—
“You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know
you. But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known
you long ago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you
too. May I make the only atonement in my power? Take the
cylinders and hear them—the first half-dozen of them are personal to
me, and they will not horrify you; then you will know me better . Dinner will by then be ready . In the meantime I shall read over some
of these documents, and shall be bette r able to understand certain
things.” He carried the phonograph himself up to my sitting-room
and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something pleasant, I am
sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true love episode of which
I know one side already .... Dr. Sewar d’s Diary . 29 September .—I was so absorb ed in that wonderf ul diary of
Jonathan Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on
without thinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to
announce dinner , so I said: “She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an
hour,” and I went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker ’s
diary , when she came in. She looked sweetly pretty , but very sad, and
her eyes were flushe d with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had cause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them
was denied me; and now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened
with recen t tears, went straight to my heart. So I said as gently as I
could:—
“I greatly fear I have distressed you.”
“Oh, no, not distres sed me,” she replied, “but I have been more
touched than I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine,
but it is cruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your
heart. It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must
hear them  spoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 167/291copied out the words on my typewriter , and none other need now
hear your heart beat, as I did.”
“No one need ever know , shall ever know,” I said in a low voice. She laid her hand on mine and said very gravely:—
“Ah, but they must!”
“Must! But why?” I asked. “Because it is a part of the terrible story , a part of poor dear Lucy’ s
death and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have
before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the
knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the
cylinders which you gave me contained  more than you intended me
to know; but I can see that there are in your record many lights to
this dark mystery . You will let me help, will you not? I know all up
to a certai n point; and I see already , though your diary only took me
to 7 September , how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible
doom was being wrought out. Jonathan and I have been working day
and night since Professor Van Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby
to get more informa tion, and he will be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us; working together and with
absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than if some of us were in
the dark.”  She looked at me so appealingly , and at the same time
manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing, that I gave in
at once to her wish es. “You shall,” I said, “do as you like in the
matter . God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terrible things yet to
learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to poor Lucy’ s
death, you will not be content, I know , to remain in the dark. Nay, the
end—the very end—may give you a gleam of peace. Come, there is
dinner . We must keep one another stron g for what is before us; we
have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learn
the rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask—if there be
anything which you do not understand, though it was apparent to us
who were present.”
Mina Harker ’s Journal. 29 September .—After dinner I came with Dr.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Seward to his study . He brought back the phonograph from  my room, and I took my
typewriter . He placed me in a comfort able chair , and arranged the
phonograph so that I could touch it without getting up, and showed
me how to stop it in case I should want to pause. Then he very
thoughtfully took a chair , with his back  to me, so that I might be as
free as possible, and began to read. I put the forked metal to my ears
and listened. When the terrible story of Lucy’ s death, and—and all that
followed, was done, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I
am not of a fainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he
jumped up with a horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-
bottle from a cupb oard, gave me some brandy , which in a few
minutes somewhat restored me. My brain was all in a whirl, and only
that there came through all the multitud e of horrors, the holy ray of
light that my dear, dear Lucy was at last at peace, I do not think I
could have borne it without making a scene. It is all so wild, and
mysterious, and strange that if I had not known Jonathan’ s
experience in Transylvania I could not have believed. As it was, I6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 168/291didn’ t know what to believe, and so got out of my difficulty by
attending to something else. I took the cover off my typewriter , and
said to Dr . Seward:—
“Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van
Helsing when he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come
on here when he arrives in London from Whitby . In this matter dates
are everything, and I think that if we get all our material ready , and
have every item put in chronological  order , we shall have done
much. You tell me that Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming
too. Let us be able to tell him when they come.” He accordingly set
the phonograph at a slow pace, and I began to typewrite from the
beginning of the seventh cylinder . I used manifold, and so took three
copies of the diary , just as I had done with all the rest. It was late
when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about his work of going his
round of the patients; when he had finished he came back and sat
near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely whilst I worked. How good  and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of good men—
even if there are monsters in it. Before I left him I remem bered what
Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor ’s perturbation at reading
something in an evening paper at the station at Exeter; so, seeing that
Dr. Sewar d keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the files of “The
Westminster Gazette ” and “The Pall Mall Gazette,” and took them to
my room. I remember how much “The Dailygraph” and “The
Whitby Gazette,” of which I had made cuttings, helped us to
understand the terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed,
so I shall look through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I
shall get some new light. I am not sleepy , and the work will help to
keep me quiet. Dr. Sewar d’s Diary . 30 September .—Mr . Harker arrived at nine o’clock. He had got his
wife’ s wire just before starting. He is uncommonly clever , if one can
judge from  his face, and full of energy. If this journal be true—and
judging by one’s own wonderful experiences, it must be—he is also
a man of great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time
was a remarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I
was prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the
quiet, business-like gentleman who came here to-day . Later .—After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own
room, and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter . They are hard at it.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together
in chronol ogical order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has
got the letters betwe en the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the
carriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his
wife’ s typescript of my diary . I wonder what they make out of it.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Here it is.... Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be

we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Stop;
that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again collating6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the meantime I should
see Renfie ld, as hitherto he has been a sort of index to the coming
and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet, but when I get at the
dates I suppose I shall.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"What a good thing that Mrs. Harker put my
cylinders into type! We never could have found the dates
otherwise.... I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded,
smiling benignly . At the moment he seem ed as sane as any one I ever
saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of subjects, all of which
he treated naturally . He then, of his own accord, spoke of going
home, a subject he has never mentioned to my knowledge during his
sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite confidently of getting his
dischar ge at once. I believe that, had I not had the chat with Harker
and read the letters and the dates of his outbursts, I should have been
prepared to sign for him after a brief time of observation. As it is, I
am darkly  suspicious. All those outbrea ks were in some way linked
with the proximity of the Count. What then does this absolute
content mean? Can it be that his instinct is satisfied as to the
vampire’ s ultimate triumph? Stay; he is himself zoöphagous, and in
his wild ravings outside the chapel door of the deserted house he
always spoke of “master.” This all seems confirmation of our idea. However , after a while I came away; my friend is just a little too
sane at present to make it safe to probe him too deep with questions.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"He might begin to think, and then—! So I came away . I mistrust
these quiet moods of his; so I have given the attendant a hint to look

"—When I received Mr. Billington’ s courteous message that he would give me any
information in his power I thought it best to go down to Whitby and
make, on the spot, such inquiries as I wanted. It was now my object
to trace that horrid cargo of the Count’ s to its place in London. Later ,
we may be able to deal with it. Billington junior , a nice lad, met me
at the station, and brought me to his father ’s house, where they had
decided that I must stay the night. They are hospitable, with true
Yorkshire hospitality: give a guest every thing, and leave him free to
do as he likes. They all knew that I was busy, and that my stay was
short, and Mr. Billington had ready in his office all the papers
concerning the consignment of boxes. It gave me almost a turn to see
again one of the letters which I had seen on the Count’ s table before I
knew of his diabolical plans. Everything had been carefully thought
out, and done system atically and with precision. He seemed to have
been prepa red for every obstacle which  might be placed by accident
in the way of his intentions being  carried out. To use an
Americanism, he had “taken no chances ,” and the absolute accuracy
with whic h his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the logical
result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it: “Fifty cases
of commo n earth, to be used for exper imental purposes.” Also the
copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of these I
got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could give
me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 170/291officers and the harbour-master . They had all something to say of the
strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local
tradition; but no one could add to the simple description “Fifty cases
of common earth.” I then saw the station-master , who kindly put me
in commu nication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add
except that the boxes were “main and mortal heavy ,” and that
shifting them was dry work. One of them  added that it was hard lines
that there wasn’ t any gentleman “such-like as yourself, squire,” to
show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form;
another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that
even the time whic h had elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care before leaving to lift, for ever and
adequately , this source of reproach. 30 September .—The station-master was good enough to give me a
line to his old companion the station-master at King’ s Cross, so that
when I arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the
arrival of the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with
the proper  officials,  and I saw that their tally was correct with the
original invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst
had been here limite d; a noble use of them had, however , been made,
and again I was compelled to deal with the result in an ex post facto
manner . From thence I went on to Carter Paterson’ s central office, where I
met with the utmost  courtesy . They looked up the transaction in their
day-book and letter -book, and at once telephoned to their King’ s
Cross office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the
teaming were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them
over, sending also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers
connected with the delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I
found the tally agreeing exactly; the carriers’  men were able to
supplement the paucity of the written  words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected almost solely with the dusty
nature of the job, and of the consequent thirst engendered in the
operators. On my affording an opportunity , through the medium of
the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a later period, this
beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:—
“That ’ere ’ouse, guv’nor , is the rumm iest I ever was in. Blyme!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"but it ain’t been touched sence a hundre d years. There was dust that
thick in the place that you might have slep’ on it without ’urtin’  of
yer bones; an’ the place was that neglected that yer might ’ave
smelled ole Jerusalem in it. But the ole chapel—that took the cike,
that did! Me and my mate, we thort we wouldn’ t never git out quick
enough. Lor’, I wouldn’t take less nor a quid a moment to stay there
arter dark.”
Having been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew
what I know , he would, I think, have raised his terms. Of one thing I am now satisfied: that all the boxes  which arrived
at Whitby from Varna in the Demeter  were safely deposited in the
old chapel at Carfax . There should be fifty of them there, unless any
have since been removed—as from Dr . Seward’ s diary I fear .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

"Later .—Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the
papers into order . Mina Harker ’s Journal
30 September .—I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain
myself. It is, I supp ose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I
have had: that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound
might act detrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby
with as brave a face as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The
effort has, however , done him good.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"He was never so resolute, never
so strong, never so full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as
that dear, good Professor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he
improves under strain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back
full of life and hope and determination; we have got everything in
order for to-night. I feel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose
one ought to pity any thing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it:
this Thing is not human—not even beast. To read Dr. Seward’ s
account of poor Lucy’ s death, and what followed, is enough to dry
up the springs of pity in one’ s heart. Later .—Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we
expected. Dr. Seward was out on busin ess, and had taken Jonathan
with him, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for it
brought back all poor dear Lucy’ s hopes of only a few months ago. Of course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van Helsi ng, too, has been quite “blowing my trumpet,” as Mr. Morris expressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I
know all about the proposals they made to Lucy . They did not quite
know what to say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my
knowledge; so they had to keep on neutral subjects. However , I
thought the matter over, and came to the conclusion that the best
thing I could do would be to post them in affairs right up to date.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I
knew from  Dr. Seward’ s diary that they had been at Lucy’ s death—
her real death—and that I need not fear to betray any secret before
the time. So I told them, as well as I could, that I had read all the
papers and diaries, and that my husband and I, having typewritten
them, had just finished putting them in order . I gave them each a
copy to read in the library . When Lord Godalming got his and turned
it over—it does make a pretty good pile—he said:—
“Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?”
I nodded, and he went on:—
“I don’t quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and
kind, and have been  working so earnes tly and so energetically , that
all I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I
have had one lesson  already in accepting facts that should make a
man humb le to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved
my poor Lucy—” Here he turned away and covered his face with his
hands. I could hear the tears in his voice.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Mr. Morris, with instinctive
delicacy , just laid a hand for a moment on his shoulder , and then6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 172/291walked quietly out of the room. I suppose there is something in
woman’ s nature that makes a man free to break down before her and
express his feelings on the tender or emotional side without feeling it
derogatory to his manhood; for when Lord Godalming found himself
alone with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and
openly . I sat down beside him and took his hand. I hope he didn’ t
think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it afterwards he
never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I know  he never
will—he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I could see that
his heart was breaking:—
“I loved dear Lucy , and I know what she was to you, and what you
were to her. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will
you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what
sorrows you have had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If
sympathy and pity can help in your affliction, won’ t you let me be of
some little service—for Lucy’ s sake?”
In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It
seemed to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence
found a vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open
hands, beat his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood
up and then sat down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I
felt an infinite pity for him, and opened  my arms unthinkingly . With
a sob he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child,
whilst he shook with emotion. We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise
above smaller matters when the mother -spirit is invoked; I felt this
big sorrowing man’ s head resting on me, as though it were that of the
baby that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as
though he were my own child. I never thought at the time how
strange it all was. After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an
apology , though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that
for days and nights past—weary days and sleepless nights—he had
been unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time
of sorrow . There was no woman whose  sympathy could be given to
him, or with whom , owing to the terrible circumstance with which
his sorrow was surrounded, he could speak freely . “I know now how
I suffered,” he said, as he dried his eyes, “but I do not know even yet
—and none other can ever know—how much your sweet sympathy
has been to me to-day . I shall know better in time; and believe me
that, thoug h I am not ungrateful now, my gratitude will grow with
my understanding. You will let me be like a brother , will you not, for
all our lives—for dear Lucy’ s sake?”
“For dear Lucy’ s sake,” I said as we clasped hands. “Ay, and for
your own sake,” he added, “for if a man’s esteem and gratitude are
ever worth the winning, you have won mine to-day . If ever the future
should bring to you a time when you need a man’ s help, believe me,
you will not call in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come
to you to break the sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come,
promise me that you will let me know .” He was so earnest, and his
sorrow was so fresh, that I felt it would comfort him, so I said:—
“I promise.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

window .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"He turned as he heard my footsteps. “How is Art?” he said. Then notic ing my red eyes, he went on: “Ah, I see you have been
comforting him. Poor old fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman
can help a man when he is in trouble of the heart; and he had no one
to comfort him.”
He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I
saw the manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he
would realise how much I knew; so I said to him:—
“I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let
me be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need
it? You will know , later on, why I speak.” He saw that I was in
earnest, and stoopin g, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed
it. It seemed but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and
impulsively I bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes,
and there was a momentary choking in his throat; he said quite
calmly:—
“Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so
long as ever you live!” Then he went into the study to his friend. “Little girl!”—the very words he had used to Lucy , and oh, but he
proved himself a friend!6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

DR. SEWARD’S DIARY
30 September .—I got home at five o’clock, and found that
Godalming and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied
the transcript of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his
wonderful wife had made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned
from his visit to the carriers’  men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had
written to me.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Mrs. Harker gave us a cup of tea, and I can honestly
say that, for the first time since I have lived in it, this old house
seemed like home . When we had finished, Mrs. Harker said:—
“Dr. Sewa rd, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr. Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your
diary interests me so much!” She looked so appealing and so pretty
that I could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I
should; so I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the
man that a lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered:
“Why?”
“She is going throug h the house, and wants to see every one in it,”
I answered. “Oh, very well,” he said; “let her come in, by all means;
but just wait a minute till I tidy up the place.” His method of tidying
was pecul iar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the
boxes before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or
was jealou s of, some interference. When he had got through his
disgusting task, he said cheerfully: “Let the lady come in,” and sat
down on the edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids
raised so that he could see her as she entered. For a moment I
thought that he might have some homicidal intent; I remembered
how quiet  he had been just before he attacked me in my own study ,
and I took care to stand where I could seize him at once if he
attempted to make a spring at her. She came into the room with an
easy gracefulness which would at once command the respect of any
lunatic—for easines s is one of the qualities mad people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly , and held out her hand. “Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,” said she. “You see, I know you, for
Dr. Seward has told me of you.” He made no immediate reply , but
eyed her all over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave
way to one of wond er, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense
astonishment, he said:—
“You’re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry , are you? You
can’t be, you know , for she’s dead.” Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as
she replied:—
“Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married
before I ever saw Dr . Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker .”
“Then what are you doing here?”
“My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr . Seward.”
“Then don’ t stay .”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 175/291“But why not?” I thought that this style of conversation might not
be pleasant to Mrs. Harker , any more than it was to me, so I joined
in:—
“How did you know I wanted to marry any one?” His reply was
simply contemptuous, given in a pause  in which he turned his eyes
from Mrs. Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:—
“What an asinine question!”
“I don’t see that at all, Mr. Renfield,” said Mrs. Harker , at once
championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and
respect as he had shown contempt to me:—
“You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker , that when a man is
so loved and honour ed as our host is, everything regarding him is of
interest in our little community . Dr. Seward is loved not only by his
household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some
of them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and
effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I
cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates
lean towards the errors of non causa  and ignoratio elenchi .” I
positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my
own pet lunatic—the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met
with—talking elemental philosophy , and with the manner of a
polished gentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker ’s presence which
had touched some chord in his memory . If this new phase was
spontaneous, or in any way due to her unconscious influence, she
must have some rare gift or power . We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was
seemingly quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me
questioningly as she began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was
again astonished, for he addressed himself to the question with the
impartiality of the completest sanity; he even took himself as an
example when he mentioned certain things. “Why , I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Indeed, it was no wonder that my friend s were alarmed, and insisted
on my being put under control. I used to fancy that life was a
positive and perpetual entity , and that by consuming a multitude of
live things , no matter how low in the scale of creation, one might
indefinitely prolong  life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I
actually tried to take human life. The doctor here will bear me out
that on one occas ion I tried to kill him for the purpose of
strengthening my vital powers by the assimilation with my own body
of his life through the medium of his blood—relying, of course, upon
the Scriptu ral phrase, ‘For the blood is the life.’ Though, indeed, the
vendor of a certain nostrum has vulgarised the truism to the very
point of contempt. Isn’t that true, doctor?” I nodded assent, for I was
so amazed  that I hardly knew what to either think or say; it was hard
to imagine that I had seen him eat up his spiders and flies not five
minutes before. Looking at my watch, I saw that I should go to the
station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs. Harker that it was time to
leave.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"She came at once, after saying pleasantly to Mr. Renfield:
“Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often, under auspices
pleasanter to yourself,” to which, to my astonishment, he replied:—6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 176/291“Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face
again.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"May He bless and keep you!”
When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys
behind me. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since
Lucy first took ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than
he has been for many a long day . Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness
of a boy . He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:—
“Ah, frien d John, how goes all? Well?","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"So! I have been busy, for I
come here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I
have much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine
husband? And Arthu r and my friend Quincey , they are with you, too? Good!”
As I drove  to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how
my own diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker ’s
suggestion; at which the Professor interrupted me:—
“Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man’ s brain—a brain
that a man should have were he much gifted—and a woman’ s heart. The good God fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He
made that so good combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has
made that woman of help to us; after to-night she must not have to
do with this so terrible affair. It is not good that she run a risk so
great. We men are determined—nay , are we not pledged?—to
destroy this monster; but it is no part for a woman. Even if she be not
harmed, her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors; and
hereafter she may suffer—both in waking, from her nerves, and in
sleep, from her dreams. And, besides, she is young woman and not
so long married; there may be other things to think of some time, if
not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she must consult with
us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and we go alone.” I
agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we had found in
his absenc e: that the house which Drac ula had bought was the very
next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed to
come on him.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"“Oh that we had known it before!” he said, “for then
we might have reach ed him in time to save poor Lucy . However , ‘the
milk that is spilt cries not out afterward s,’ as you say. We shall not
think of that, but go on our way to the end.” Then he fell into a
silence that lasted till we entered my own gateway . Before we went
to prepare for dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:—
“I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your
husband have put up in exact order all things that have been, up to
this moment.”
“Not up to this moment, Professor ,” she said impulsively , “but up
to this morning.”
“But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all
the little things have  made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one
who has told is the worse for it.”
Mrs. Hark er began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets,
she said:—
“Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"It
is my record of to-day . I too have seen the need of putting down at
present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 177/291what is personal. Must it go in?” The Professor read it over gravely ,
and handed it back, saying:—
“It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It
can but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your
friends, more honour you—as well as more esteem and love.” She
took it back with another blush and a bright smile. And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are
complete and in order. The Professor took away one copy to study
after dinner , and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o’clock. The rest of us have already read everything; so when we meet in the
study we shall all be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan
of battle with this terrible and mysterious enemy . Mina Harker ’s Journal. 30 September .—When we met in Dr. Seward’ s study two hours
after dinner , which had been at six o’clock, we unconsciously formed
a sort of board or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of
the table, to which Dr. Seward motion ed him as he came into the
room. He made me sit next to him on his right, and asked me to act
as secretary; Jonathan sat next to me. Opposite us were Lord
Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris—Lord Godalming being
next the Professor , and Dr. Seward in the centre. The Professor said:
—
“I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts
that are in these papers.” We all expressed assent, and he went on:—
“Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of
enemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to you
something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for
me.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our
measure according. “There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that
they exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy
experience, the teachings and the records of the past give proof
enough for sane peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were
it not that through long years I have train myself to keep an open
mind, I could not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on
my ear. ‘See!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"see! I prove; I prove.’  Alas! Had I known at the first
what now I know— nay, had I even guess at him—one so precious
life had been spared  to many of us who did love her. But that is gone;
and we must so work, that other poor souls perish not, whilst we can
save. The nosferatu  do not die like the bee when he sting once. He is
only stron ger; and being stronger , have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is amongst us is of himself so strong in person
as twenty men; he is of cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be
the growth of ages; he have still the aids of necromancy , which is, as
his etymology imply , the divination by the dead, and all the dead that
he can come nigh to are for him at command; he is brute, and more
than brute; he is devil in callous, and the heart of him is not; he can,
within limitations, appear at will when, and where, and in any of the
forms that are to him; he can, within his range, direct the elements;
the storm, the fog, the thunder; he can command all the meaner
things: the rat, and the owl, and the bat—the moth, and the fox, and
the wolf; he can grow and become small; and he can at times vanish6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 178/291and come unknown. How then are we to begin our strike to destroy
him? How  shall we find his where; and having found it, how can we
destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible task that we
undertake, and there may be consequenc e to make the brave shudder . For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then where
end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not mere
life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward
become foul things of the night like him—without heart or
conscience, preying  on the bodies and the souls of those we love
best. To us for ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open
them to us again? We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the
face of God’ s sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for
man. But we are face to face with duty; and in such case must we
shrink? For me, I say, no; but then I am old, and life, with his
sunshine, his fair places, his song of birds, his music and his love, lie
far behind. You others are young. Some have seen sorrow; but there
are fair days yet in store. What say you?”
Whilst he was speak ing, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh
so much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming
him when I saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its
touch—so strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man’ s hand can
speak for itself; it does not even need a woman’ s love to hear its
music. When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my
eyes, and I in his; there was no need for speaking between us. “I answer for Mina and myself,” he said. “Count me in, Profe ssor,” said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as
usual. “I am with you,” said Lord Godalming, “for Lucy’ s sake, if for no
other reason.”
Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after
laying his golden crucifix on the table,  held out his hand on either
side. I took his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan
held my right with his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as
we all took hands our solemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy
cold, but it did not even occur to me to draw back. We resumed our
places, and Dr. Van Helsing went on with a sort of cheerfulness
which showed that the serious work had begun. It was to be taken as
gravely , and in as businesslike a way, as any other transaction of life:
—
“Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are
not withou t strength. We have on our side power of combination—a
power denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we
are free to act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are
ours equally . In fact, so far as our power s extend, they are unfettered,
and we are free to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an
end to achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"“Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are
restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the
limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular . “All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do
not at the first appea r much, when the matter is one of life and death6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 179/291—nay of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in
the first place because we have to be—no other means is at our
control—and secondly , because, after all, these things—tradition and
superstition—are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for
others—though not, alas! for us—on them? A year ago which of us
would have received such a possibility , in the midst of our scientific,
sceptical, matter -of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a
belief that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that
the vampir e, and the belief in his limitat ions and his cure, rest for the
moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known
everywhere that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he
flourish in Germany all over, in France, in India, even in the
Chernosese; and in China, so far from us in all ways, there even is
he, and the peoples fear him at this day. He have follow the wake of
the berserker Icelander , the devil-begott en Hun, the Slav, the Saxon,
the Magya r. So far, then, we have all we may act upon; and let me
tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified by what we have
seen in our own so unhappy experience. The vampire live on, and
cannot die by mere passing of the time;  he can flourish when that he
can fatten  on the blood of the living. Even more, we have seen
amongst us that he can even grow younger; that his vital faculties
grow strenuous, and seem as though they refresh themselves when
his specia l pabulum is plenty . But he cannot flourish without this
diet; he eat not as others. Even friend Jonathan, who lived with him
for weeks, did never see him to eat, never! He throws no shadow; he
make in the mirror no reflect, as again Jonathan observe. He has the
strength of many of his hand—witness again Jonathan when he shut
the door against the wolfs, and when he help him from the diligence
too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather from the ship
arrival in Whitby , when he tear open the dog; he can be as bat, as
Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby , and as friend John
saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw
him at the window of Miss Lucy . He can come in mist which he
create—that noble ship’ s captain proved him of this; but, from what
we know , the distance he can make this mist is limited, and it can
only be round himself. He come on moonlight rays as elemental dust
—as again  Jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of Dracula. He
become so small—we ourselves saw Miss Lucy , ere she was at
peace, slip through a hairbreadth space  at the tomb door. He can,
when once he find his way, come out from anything or into anything,
no matter how close  it be bound or even fused up with fire—solder
you call it. He can see in the dark—no small power this, in a world
which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me through. He
can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even more
prisoner than the slave of the galley , than the madman in his cell. He
cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey
some of nature’ s laws—why we know not. He may not enter
anywhere at the first, unless there be some one of the household who
bid him to come; though afterwards he can come as he please. His
power ceases, as does that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times can he have limite d freedom. If he be not at the
place whither he is bound, he can only change himself at noon or at
exact sunrise or sunset. These things are we told, and in this record
of ours we have proof by inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 180/291will within his limit , when he have his earth-home, his coffin-home,
his hell-home, the place unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the
grave of the suicide at Whitby; still at other time he can only change
when the time come. It is said, too, that he can only pass running
water at the slack or the flood of the tide. Then there are things
which so afflict him that he has no powe r, as the garlic that we know
of; and as for things sacred, as this symbol, my crucifix, that was
amongst us even now when we resolve, to them he is nothing, but in
their prese nce he take his place far off and silent with respect. There
are others, too, whic h I shall tell you of, lest in our seeking we may
need them . The branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he
move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that
he be true dead; and as for the stake through him, we know already
of its peace; or the cut-of f head that giveth rest. We have seen it with
our eyes. “Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can
confine him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know . But he is clever . I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth
University , to make his record; and, from all the means that are, he
tell me of what he has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode
Dracula who won his name against the Turk, over the great river on
the very frontier of Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common
man; for in that time, and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the
cleverest and the most cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of
the ‘land beyond the forest.’  That mighty brain and that iron
resolution went with him to his grave, and are even now arrayed
against us. The Draculas were, says Arminius, a great and noble race,
though now and again were scions who were held by their coevals to
have had dealings with the Evil One. They learned his secrets in the
Scholomance, amon gst the mountains over Lake Hermanstadt, where
the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the records are such
words as ‘stregoica’—witch, ‘ordog,’  and ‘pokol’—Satan and hell;
and in one manuscript this very Dracula is spoken of as ‘wampyr ,’
which we all understand too well. There have been from the loins of
this very one great men and good women, and their graves make
sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"For it is not the
least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in all good; in
soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.”
Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the
window , and he now got up quietly , and went out of the room. There
was a little pause, and then the Professor went on:—
“And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data,
and we must proceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the
inquiry of Jonathan that from the castle  to Whitby came fifty boxes
of earth, all of which were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at
least some  of these boxes have been removed. It seems to me, that
our first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the
house beyond that wall where we look to-day; or whether any more
have been removed. If the latter , we must trace——”
Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the
house came the sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was
shattered with a bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the
embrasure, struck the far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 181/291coward, for I shrieked out. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord
Godalming flew over to the window and threw up the sash. As he did
so we heard Mr . Morris’ s voice without:—
“Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you
about it.” A minute later he came in and said:—
“It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs. Harker , most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly . But the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big
bat and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the
damned brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I
went out to have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings,
whenever I have seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.”
“Did you hit it?” asked Dr .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Van Helsing. “I don’t know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.”
Without saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to
resume his statement:—
“We must  trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready , we
must either capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to
speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it. Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the
hours of noon and sunset, and so engag e with him when he is at his
most weak. “And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be
well. You are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-
night, you no more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our
hope, and we shall act all the more free that you are not in the
danger , such as we are.”
All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem
to me good that they should brave dang er and, perhaps, lessen their
safety—strength being the best safety— through care of me; but their
minds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to
swallow , I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of
me. Mr. Morris resumed the discussion:—
“As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house
right now. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part
may save another victim.”
I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action
came so close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that
if I appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even
leave me out of their counsels altogether . They have now gone off to
Carfax, with means to get into the house. Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman
can sleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and
pretend to sleep, lest Jonathan have adde d anxiety about me when he
returns. Dr. Sewar d’s Diary . 1 October , 4 a. m.—Just as we were about to leave the house, an
urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would
see him at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 182/291to me. I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in
the morning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:—
“He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager . I
don’t know but what, if you don’t see him soon, he will have one of
his violen t fits.” I knew the man woul d not have said this without
some cause, so I said: “All right; I’ll go now”; and I asked the others
to wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my “patient.”
“Take me with you, friend John,” said the Professor . “His case in
your diary  interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again
on our case. I should much like to see him, and especial when his
mind is disturbed.”
“May I come also?” asked Lord Godalming. “Me too?” said Quincey Morris. “May I come?” said Harker . I
nodded, and we all went down the passage together . We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more
rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There
was an unusual unde rstanding of himself, which was unlike anything
I had ever met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his
reasons would prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into
the room, but none of the others at first said anything. His request
was that I would at once release him from the asylum and send him
home. This he backed up with arguments regarding his complete
recovery , and adduced his own existin g sanity . “I appeal to your
friends,” he said, “they will, perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on
my case. By the way, you have not introduced me.” I was so much
astonished, that the oddness of introducing a madman in an asylum
did not strike me at the moment; and, besides, there was a certain
dignity in the man’ s manner , so much of the habit of equality , that I
at once made the introduction: “Lord Godalming; Professor Van
Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr. Renfield.” He shook
hands with each of them, saying in turn:—
“Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the
Windham; I grieve to know , by your holding the title, that he is no
more. He was a man loved and honoure d by all who knew him; and
in his youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch,
much patronised on Derby night. Mr.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Morris, you should be proud of
your great  state. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which
may have far-reaching effects hereaft er, when the Pole and the
Tropics may hold alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of
Treaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlar gement, when the
Monroe doctrine takes its true place as a political fable. What shall
any man say of his pleasure at meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no
apology for dropping all forms of conventional prefix. When an
individual has revolutionised therapeutics by his discovery of the
continuous evolution of brain-matter , conventional forms are
unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to one of a class. You,
gentlemen, who by nationality , by heredity, or by the possession of
natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective places in the moving
world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at least the majority of
men who are in full possession of their liberties. And I am sure that
you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as well as scientist,
will deem  it a moral duty to deal with me as one to be considered as6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 183/291under exceptional circumstances.” He made this last appeal with a
courtly air of conviction which was not without its own charm. I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the
conviction, despite my knowledge of the man’ s character and history ,
that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to
tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity , and would see about the
necessary formalitie s for his release in the morning. I thought it
better to wait, however , before making  so grave a statement, for of
old I knew  the sudden changes to whic h this particular patient was
liable. So I contente d myself with making a general statement that he
appeared to be improving very rapidly ; that I would have a longer
chat with him in the morning, and would then see what I could do in
the direction of meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him,
for he said quickly:—
“But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I
desire to go at once—here—now—this very hour—this very
moment, if I may. Time presses, and in our implied agreement with
the old scytheman it is of the essence of the contract. I am sure it is
only necessary to put before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so momento us a wish, to ensure its
fulfilment.” He looked at me keenly , and seeing the negative in my
face, turned to the others, and scrutinised them closely . Not meeting
any suf ficient response, he went on:—
“Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?”
“You have,” I said frankly , but at the same time, as I felt, brutally . There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:—
“Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me
ask for this concessi on—boon, privilege, what you will. I am content
to implore in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake
of others. I am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but
you may , I assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound
and unself ish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you
look, sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments
which anim ate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best
and truest of your friends.” Again he looked at us all keenly . I had a
growing conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual
method was but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so
determined to let him go on a little longer, knowing from experience
that he would, like all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van
Helsing was gazing at him with a look of utmost intensity , his bushy
eyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone which did not surprise me at the time,
but only when I thought of it afterw ards—for it was as of one
addressing an equal:—
“Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free
to-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me—a
stranger , without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open
mind—Dr . Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own
responsibility , the privilege you seek.” He shook his head sadly , and
with a look of poignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:—
“Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim  the privilege of reason in
the highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 184/291reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt,
since you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very
defect. If you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest
course, how can we perform the duty which you yourself put upon
us? Be wise, and help us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve
your wish.” He still shook his head as he said:—
“Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is
complete, and if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment;
but I am not my own master in the matter . I can only ask you to trust
me. If I am refuse d, the responsibility does not rest with me.” I
thought it was now time to end the scene, which was becoming too
comically grave, so I went towards the door , simply saying:—
“Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night.”
As, howev er, I got near the door, a new change came over the
patient. He moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I
feared that he was about to make another homicidal attack. My fears,
however , were groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly ,
and made his petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very
excess of his emoti on was militating against him, by restoring us
more to our old relations, he became still more demonstrative. I
glanced at Van Helsing, and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes;
so I became a little more fixed in my manner , if not more stern, and
motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing. I had previously
seen something of the same constantly  growing excitement in him
when he had to make some request of which at the time he had
thought much, such, for instance, as when he wanted a cat; and I was
prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this
occasion. My expectation was not realised, for, when he found that
his appeal would not be successful, he got into quite a frantic
condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up his hands,
wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a torrent of
entreaty , with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his whole face
and form expressive of the deepest emotion:—
“Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me
out of this house at once. Send me away  how you will and where you
will; send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me
in a strait-waistcoat,  manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let
me go out of this. You don’t know what you do by keeping me here. I am speaking from  the depths of my heart—of my very soul. You
don’t know whom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I may not tell. By all you hold sacred—by all you hold dear—by
your love that is lost—by your hope that lives—for the sake of the
Almighty , take me out of this and save my soul from guilt! Can’ t you
hear me, man?","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Can’t you understand? Will you never learn? Don’ t
you know  that I am sane and earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a
mad fit, but a sane man fighting for his soul? Oh, hear me!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!”
I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and
so would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up. “Come,” I said sternly, “no more of this; we have had quite
enough already . Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly .”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 185/291He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several
moments. Then, without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down
on the side of the bed. The collapse had come, as on former
occasion, just as I had expected. When I was leaving the room, last of our party , he said to me in a
quiet, well-bred voice:—
“You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind,
later on, that I did what I could to convince you to-night.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL
1 October , 5 a. m.—I went with the party to the search with an
easy mind , for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and
well. I am so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do
the work. Somehow , it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful
business at all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her
energy and brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in
such a way that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is
finished, and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I
think, all a little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we
came away from his room we were silent till we got back to the
study . Then Mr .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Morris said to Dr . Seward:—
“Say , Jack, if that man wasn’ t attempting a bluff, he is about the
sanest lunatic I ever saw. I’m not sure, but I believe that he had some
serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a
chance.” Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing
added:—
“Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I’m glad
of it, for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that
last hysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn,
and in our present  task we must take no chance, as my friend
Quincey would say.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
All is best as they are.” Dr.,"Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Seward seemed to
answer them both in a dreamy kind of way:—
“I don’t know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an
ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but
he seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I
am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can’t forget
how he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to
tear my throat out with his teeth. Besid es, he called the Count ‘lord
and master,’ and he may want to get out to help him in some
diabolical way. That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his
own kind to help him, so I suppose he isn’t above trying to use a
respectable lunatic. He certainly did seem earnest, though. I only
hope we have done  what is best. These things, in conjunction with
the wild work we have in hand, help to unnerve a man.” The
Professor stepped over, and laying his hand on his shoulder , said in
his grave, kindly way:—
“Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very
sad and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else
have we to hope for, except the pity of the good God?” Lord
Godalming had slipped away for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver whistle, as he remarked:—
“That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I’ve got an antidote
on call.” Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house,
taking care to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the
moonlight shone out. When we got to the porch the Professor opened6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 187/291his bag and took out a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting
them into four little groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:—
“My friends, we are going into a terrible danger , and we need arms
of many kinds. Our enemy is not merely  spiritual. Remember that he
has the strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our
windpipes are of the common kind—and therefore breakable or
crushable—his are not amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or
a body of men more  strong in all than him, can at certain times hold
him; but they cannot hurt him as we can be hurt by him. We must,
therefore, guard ourselves from his touch. Keep this near your
heart”—as he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it out to
me, I being nearest to him—“put these flowers round your neck”—
here he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic blossoms—“for
other enem ies more mundane, this revolver and this knife; and for
aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can fasten to your
breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this, which we must not
desecrate needless.”  This was a portion of Sacred Wafer, which he
put in an envelope  and handed to me. Each of the others was
similarly equipped. “Now ,” he said, “friend John, where are the
skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break
house by the window , as before at Miss Lucy’ s.”
Dr. Seward tried one or two skelet on keys, his mechanical
dexterity as a surgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got
one to suit; after a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and,
with a rusty clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty
hinges creaked, and it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the
image conveyed to me in Dr. Seward’ s diary of the opening of Miss
Westenra’ s tomb; I fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the
others, for with one accord they shrank back. The Professor was the
first to move forward, and stepped into the open door . “In manus tuas, Dom ine!” he said, crossing himself as he passed
over the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we
should have lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from
the road. The Profes sor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be
able to open it from  within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our lamps and proceeded on our search. The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the
rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great
shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there
was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so
powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that
terrible experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common
to us all, for I noticed that the others kept looking over their
shoulders at every sound and every new shadow , just as I felt myself
doing. The whole  place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly
inches deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on
holding down my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust
was cracked. The walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the
corners were masses of spider ’s webs, whereon the dust had gathered
till they looked like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them
partly down. On a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys, with a
time-yellowed label  on each. They had been used several times, for6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 188/291on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of dust, similar
to that exposed when the Professor lifted them. He turned to me and
said:—
“You know this place, Jonathan.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"You have copied maps of it, and
you know it at least more than we do. Which is the way to the
chapel?” I had an idea of its direction, though on my former visit I
had not been able to get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a
few wrong turnings found myself oppos ite a low, arched oaken door,
ribbed with iron bands. “This is the spot,” said the Professor as he
turned his lamp on a small map of the house, copied from the file of
my original correspondence regarding the purchase.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"With a little
trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the door. We were
prepared for some unpleasantness, for as we were opening the door a
faint, malo dorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps, but none of
us ever expected such an odour as we encountered. None of the
others had met the Count at all at close quarters, and when I had seen
him he was either in the fasting stage of his existence in his rooms
or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in a ruined building open
to the air; but here the place was small and close, and the long disuse
had made the air stagnant and foul. There was an earthy smell, as of
some dry miasma, which came through the fouler air. But as to the
odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not alone that it was
composed of all the ills of mortality and with the pungent, acrid
smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had become itself
corrupt. Faugh!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"it sickens me to think of it. Every breath exhaled by
that monster seemed to have clung to the place and intensified its
loathsomeness. Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought
our enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high
and terribl e purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength
which rose above  merely physical considerations. After the
involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one
and all set about our work as though that loathsome place were a
garden of roses. We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor
saying as we began:—
“The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must
then exam ine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot
get some clue as to what has become of the rest.” A glance was
sufficient to show how many remained, for the great earth chests
were bulky , and there was no mistaking them. There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a
fright, for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the
vaulted door into the dark passage beyo nd, I looked too, and for an
instant my heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the
shadow , I seemed to see the high lights of the Count’ s evil face, the
ridge of the nose, the red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor . It was
only for a moment, for, as Lord Godalm ing said, “I thought I saw a
face, but it was only the shadows,” and resumed his inquiry , I turned
my lamp in the direction, and stepped into the passage. There was no
sign of any one; and as there were no corners, no doors, no aperture
of any kind, but only the solid walls of the passage, there could be no6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 189/291hiding-place even for him. I took it that fear had helped imagination,
and said nothing. A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a
corner , which he was examining. We all followed his movements
with our eyes, for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on
us, and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence, which twinkled
like stars. We all instinctively drew back. The whole place was
becoming alive with rats. For a moment or two we stood appalled , all save Lord Godalming,
who was seemingly prepared for such an emer gency . Rushing over to
the great iron-bound  oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described
from the outside, and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in
the lock, drew the huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking
his little silver whistle from his pocket,  he blew a low, shrill call. It
was answ ered from behind Dr. Seward ’s house by the yelping of
dogs, and after abou t a minute three terriers came dashing round the
corner of the house . Unconsciously we had all moved towards the
door, and as we moved I noticed that the dust had been much
disturbed: the boxes which had been taken out had been brought this
way. But even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats
had vastly increased. They seemed to swarm over the place all at
once, till the lamplight, shining on their moving dark bodies and
glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look like a bank of earth set
with firefl ies. The dogs dashed on, but at the threshold suddenly
stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting their noses,
began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were multiplying
in thousands, and we moved out. Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in,
placed him on the floor . The instant his feet touched the ground he
seemed to recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of
a score, the other dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same
manner , had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished. With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed,
for the dogs frisked  about and barked merrily as they made sudden
darts at their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and
tossed them in the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our
spirits rise. Whether it was the purifying  of the deadly atmosphere by
the opening of the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by
finding ourselves in the open I know not; but most certainly the
shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe, and the occasion
of our coming lost something of its grim  significance, though we did
not slacke n a whit in our resolution. We closed the outer door and
barred and locked it, and bringing the dogs with us, began our search
of the house. We found nothing throughout except dust in
extraordinary proportions, and all untouched save for my own
footsteps when I had made my first visit. Never once did the dogs
exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when we returned to
the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbit-hunting
in a summer wood. The morning was quickening in the east when we emer ged from
the front.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

his pocket when he had done. “So far,” he said, “our night has been eminently successful.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"No
harm has come to us such as I feared  might be and yet we have
ascertained how many boxes are missin g. More than all do I rejoice
that this, our first—and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous—
step has been accom plished without the bringing thereinto our most
sweet Madam Mina or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts
with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she might never
forget. One lesson, too, we have learned , if it be allowable to argue a
particulari : that the brute beasts which are to the Count’ s command
are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power; for look,
these rats that would come to his call, just as from his castle top he
summon the wolves to your going and to that poor mother ’s cry,
though they come to him, they run pell-m ell from the so little dogs of
my friend  Arthur . We have other matters before us, other dangers,
other fears; and that monster—he has not used his power over the
brute world for the only or the last time to-night. So be it that he has
gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity to cry ‘check’  in
some ways in this chess game, which we play for the stake of human
souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand, and we
have reaso n to be content with our first night’ s work. It may be
ordained that we have many nights and days to follow , if full of peril;
but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.”
The house  was silent when we got back, save for some poor
creature who was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a
low, moan ing sound  from Renfield’ s room. The poor wretch was
doubtless torturing himself, after the manner of the insane, with
needless thoughts of pain. I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep,
breathing so softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks
paler than usual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am
truly thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even
of our deliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I did
not think so at first, but I know better now.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Therefore I am glad that
it is settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear;
and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if
once she suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our
work is to be a sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can
tell her that all is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the
nether world. I daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence
after such confidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow
I shall keep dark over to-night’ s doings, and shall refuse to speak of
anything that has happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb
her. 1 October , later.—I suppo se it was natural that we shou ld have all
overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no
rest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept
till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or
three times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that
for a few seconds she did not recognize  me, but looked at me with a
sort of blank terror , as one looks who has been waked out of a bad6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

later in the day. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been
removed, and if it be that several were taken in any of these removals
we may be able to trace them all. Such will, of course, immensely
simplify our labour , and the sooner the matter is attended to the
better .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

"Dr. Sewar d’s Diary . 1 October .—It was towards noon when I was awakened by the
Professor walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful
than usual, and it is quite evident that last night’ s work has helped to
take some of the brooding weight off his mind. After going over the
adventure of the night he suddenly said:—
“Your patient intere sts me much. May it be that with you I visit
him this morning? Or if that you are too occupy , I can go alone if it
may be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk
philosophy , and reason so sound.” I had some work to do which
pressed, so I told him that if he would go alone I would be glad, as
then I should not have to keep him waiting; so I called an attendant
and gave him the necessary instructions. Before the Professor left the
room I cautioned him against getting any false impression from my
patient. “But,” he answered, “I want him to talk of himself and of his
delusion as to consuming live things. He said to Madam Mina, as I
see in your diary of yesterday , that he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?”
“Excuse me,” I said, “but the answer is here.” I laid my hand on
the type-w ritten matter . “When our sane and learned lunatic made
that very statement of how he used to consum e life, his mouth was
actually nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just
before Mrs. Harker entered the room.” Van Helsing smiled in turn. “Good!” he said. “Your memory is true, friend John. I should have
remembered. And yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory
which makes mental disease such a fascinating study . Perhaps I may
gain more  knowled ge out of the folly of this madman than I shall
from the teaching of the most wise. Who knows?” I went on with my
work, and before long was through that in hand. It seemed that the
time had been very short indeed, but there was Van Helsing back in
the study . “Do I interrupt?” he asked politely as he stood at the door . “Not at all,” I answered. “Come in. My work is finished, and I am
free. I can go with you now , if you like. “It is needless; I have seen him!”
“Well?”
“I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was
short. Whe n I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre,
with his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen
discontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a
measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever . “Don’ t you know me?” I asked. His answer was not reassuring: “I
know you well enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you
would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed Dutchmen!” Not a word more would he say,
but sat in his implac able sullenness as indifferent to me as though I
had not been in the room at all. Thus departed for this time my6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 192/291chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I
may, and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul
Madam Mina. Friend John, it does rejoic e me unspeakable that she is
no more to be paine d, no more to be worried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, it is better so.”
“I agree with you with all my heart,” I answered earnestly , for I
did not want him to weaken in this matter . “Mrs. Harker is better out
of it. Thin gs are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and
who have been in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for
a woman, and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would
in time infallibly have wrecked her .”
So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker;
Quincey and Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-
boxes. I shall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night. Mina Harker ’s Journal. 1 October.—It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-
day; after Jonathan’ s full confidence for so many years, to see him
manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This
morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday , and though
Jonathan was late too, he was the earlie r. He spoke to me before he
went out, never more sweetly or tender ly, but he never mentioned a
word of what had happened in the visit to the Count’ s house. And yet
he must have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I
suppose it must have distressed him even more than it did me. They
all agreed that it was best that I should not be drawn further into this
awful work, and I acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything
from me! And now I am crying like a silly fool, when I know  it
comes from my husband’ s great love and from the good, good
wishes of those other strong men. That has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all;
and lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I
kept anyth ing from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he
has feared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of
my heart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad and
low-spirited to-day .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible
excitement. Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because
they told me to. I didn’ t feel sleepy , and I did feel full of devouring
anxiety . I kept thinking over everything that has been ever since
Jonathan came to see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible
tragedy , with fate pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does seems, no matter how right it may be, to
bring on the very thing which is most to be deplored. If I hadn’ t gone
to Whitby, perhaps poor dear Lucy woul d be with us now. She hadn’ t
taken to visiting the churchyard till I came, and if she hadn’ t come
there in the day-time with me she wouldn’ t have walked there in her
sleep; and if she hadn’t gone there at night and asleep, that monster
couldn’ t have destroyed her as he did. Oh, why did I ever go to
Whitby? There now, crying again!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I wonder what has come over me
to-day . I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew that I had been
crying twice in one morning—I, who never cried on my own
account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear—the dear6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 193/291fellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do
feel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessons
that we poor women have to learn.... I can’t quite remem ber how I fell asleep last night. I remember
hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds,
like praying on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield’ s room,
which is somewhere under this. And then there was silence over
everything, silence so profound that it startled me, and I got up and
looked out of the window . All was dark and silent, the black shadows
thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of their
own. Not a thing seemed to be stirring,  but all to be grim and fixed
as death or fate; so that a thin streak of white mist, that crept with
almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house,
seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of its own. I think that the
digression of my thoughts must have done me good, for when I got
back to bed I found  a lethar gy creeping over me. I lay a while, but
could not quite sleep, so I got out and looked out of the window
again. The mist was spreading, and was now close up to the house,
so that I could see it lying thick agains t the wall, as though it were
stealing up to the windows. The poor man was more loud than ever,
and though I could not distinguish a word he said, I could in some
way recog nise in his tones some passionate entreaty on his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the
attendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept
into bed, and pulled  the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in
my ears. I was not then a bit sleepy , at least so I thought; but I must
have fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything
until the morning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an
effort and a little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan
who was bending over me. My dream was very peculiar , and was
almost typical of the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or
continued in, dreams. I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet,
and my hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could
proceed at the usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then
it began to dawn upon me that the air was heavy , and dank, and cold. I put back the clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that
all was dim around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but
turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which
had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it
occurred to me that I had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to make certain on the point, but some leaden
lethar gy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will. I lay still and
endured; that was all. I closed my eyes, but could still see through
my eyelids. (It is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us, and how
conveniently we can imagine.) The mist grew thicker and thicker and
I could see now how it came in, for I could see it like smoke—or
with the white energy of boiling water—pouring in, not through the
window , but through the joinings of the door. It got thicker and
thicker , till it seemed as if it became concentrated into a sort of pillar
of cloud in the room, through the top of which I could see the light of
the gas shining like a red eye. Things began to whirl through my
brain just as the cloudy column was now whirling in the room, and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 194/291through it all came the scriptural words “a pillar of cloud by day and
of fire by night.” Was it indeed some such spiritual guidance that was
coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was composed of both the
day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the red eye, which at
the though t got a new fascination for me; till, as I looked, the fire
divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red
eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering
when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary’ s Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus
that Jonathan had seen those awful women growing into reality
through the whirling  mist in the moonlight, and in my dream I must
have fainted, for all became black darkness. The last conscious effort
which imagination made was to show me a livid white face bending
over me out of the mist. I must be careful of such dreams, for they
would unseat one’s reason if there were too much of them. I would
get Dr.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Van Helsing  or Dr. Seward to prescribe something for me
which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm them. Such a
dream at the present time would become woven into their fears for
me. To-night I shall  strive hard to sleep naturally . If I do not, I shall
to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that cannot
hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night’ s sleep. Last night
tired me more than if I had not slept at all.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"2 October 10 p. m.—Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must
have slept soundly , for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed;
but the sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and
spiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he
was very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade
God bless me. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I
think of him. This is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be miserable if he knew  I had been crying. He and
the others were out till dinner -time, and they all came in tired. I did
what I could to brigh ten them up, and I suppose that the effort did me
good, for I forgot how tired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed,
and all went off to smoke together , as they said, but I knew that they
wanted to tell each other of what had occurred to each during the
day; I could see from Jonathan’ s manner that he had something
important to communicate. I was not so sleepy as I should have
been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to give me a little
opiate of some kind,  as I had not slept well the night before. He very
kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to me, telling
me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I have taken
it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope I have not
done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear comes:
that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the power of
waking. I might want it.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL
1 October , evening. —I found Thomas Snelling in his house at
Bethnal Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember
anything. The very prospect of beer which my expected coming had
opened to him had proved too much, and he had begun too early on
his expected debauch. I learned, however , from his wife, who
seemed a decent, poor soul, that he was only the assistant to Smollet,
who of the two mates was the responsible person. So off I drove to
Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph Smollet at home and in his
shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a saucer . He is a decent,
intelligent fellow , distinctly a good, reliable type of workman, and
with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all about the incident
of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog’s-eared notebook, which he
produced from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of his
trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick, half-
obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There
were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left
at 197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six
which he deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey . If then the Count
meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these
places were chosen as the first of delivery , so that later he might
distribute more fully. The systematic manner in which this was done
made me think that he could not mean to confine himself to two
sides of London. He was now fixed on the far east of the northern
shore, on the east of the southern shore,  and on the south. The north
and west were surely never meant to be left out of his diabolical
scheme—let alone the City itself and the very heart of fashionable
London in the south-west and west. I went back to Smollet, and
asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken from
Carfax. He replied:—
“Well, guv’nor , you’ve treated me wery ’an’some”—I had given
him half a sovereign—“an’  I’ll tell yer all I know . I heard a man by
the name of Bloxam say four nights ago in the ’Are an’ ’Ounds, in
Pincher ’s Alley , as ’ow he an’ his mate  ’ad ’ad a rare dusty job in a
old ’ouse at Purfect. There ain’t a-man y such jobs as this ’ere, an’
I’m thinkin’  that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut.” I asked
if he could tell me where to find him. I told him that if he could get
me the address it would be worth another half-sovereign to him. So
he gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up, saying that he was
going to begin the search then and there . At the door he stopped, and
said:—
“Look ’ere, guv’nor , there ain’t no sense in me a-keepin’  you ’ere. I may find Sam soon, or I mayn’ t; but anyhow he ain’t like to be in a
way to tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the
booze. If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer
address on it, I’ll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

ye won’ t ketch ’im; for Sam gets off main early , never mind the
booze the night afore.”
This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny
to buy an envelope  and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and
when Smollet had again faithfully promised to post the address when
found, I took my way to home. We’re on the track anyhow .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I am tired
to-night, and want sleep. Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too
pale; her eyes look as though she had been crying. Poor dear, I’ve no
doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly
anxious about me and the others. But it is best as it is. It is better to
be disappointed and worried in such a way now than to have her
nerve broken. The doctors were quite right to insist on her being kept
out of this dreadful business. I must be firm, for on me this particular
burden of silence must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with
her under any circum stances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after
all, for she herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not
spoken of the Count or his doings ever since we told her of our

enclosed, on which was written with a carpenter ’s pencil in a
sprawling hand:—

I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked
heavy and sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to
wake her, but that, when I should return from this new search, I
would arrange for her going back to Exeter . I think she would be
happier in our own home, with her daily  tasks to interest her, than in
being here amongst us and in ignorance. I only saw Dr.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

to Walworth and found, with some difficulty , Potter ’s Court. Mr. Smollet’ s spelling misled me, as I asked for Poter ’s Court instead of
Potter ’s Court. However , when I had found the court, I had no
difficulty in discovering Corcoran’ s lodging-house. When I asked the
man who came to the door for the “depite,” he shook his head, and
said: “I dunno ’im. There ain’t no such a person ’ere; I never ’eard of
’im in all my bloomin’  days. Don’ t believe there ain’t nobody of that
kind livin’  ere or anywheres.” I took out Smollet’ s letter , and as I
read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name of
the court might guide me. “What are you?” I asked.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"“I’m the depity ,” he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right
track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put
the deput y’s knowledge at my dispos al, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who had slept off the remains  of his beer on the previous
night at Corcoran’ s, had left for his work at Poplar at five o’clock
that morn ing. He could not tell me where the place of work was
situated, but he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a “new-
fangled ware’us”; and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 197/291It was twelve o’clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a
building, and this I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were
having their dinner . One of these suggested that there was being
erected at Cross Angel Street a new “cold storage” building; and as
this suited  the condition of a “new-fangled ware’us,” I at once drove
to it. An interview with a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman,
both of whom were appeased with the coin of the realm, put me on
the track of Bloxam ; he was sent for on my suggesting that I was
willing to pay his day’s wages to his foreman for the privilege of
asking him a few questions on a private matter . He was a smart
enough fellow, though rough of speec h and bearing. When I had
promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told
me that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in
Piccadilly , and had taken from this house to the latter nine great
boxes—“main heavy  ones”—with a horse and cart hired by him for
this purpo se. I asked him if he could tell me the number of the house
in Piccadilly , to which he replied:—
“Well, guv’nor, I forgits the number , but it was only a few doors
from a big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It
was a dusty old ’ouse, too, though nothin’ to the dustiness of the
’ouse we tooked the bloomin’  boxes from.”
“How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?”
“There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin’  in the ’ouse
at Purfleet. He ’elpe d me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse me, but he was the strongest chap  I ever struck, an’ him a old
feller , with a white  moustache, one that thin you would think he
couldn’ t throw a shadder .”
How this phrase thrilled through me! “Why , ’e took up ’is end o’ the boxes like they was pounds of tea,
and me a-puf fin’ an’ a-blowin’  afore I could up-end mine anyhow—
an’ I’m no chicken, neither .”
“How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?” I asked. “He was there too. He must ’a’ started off and got there afore me,
for when I rung of the bell he kem an’ opened the door ’isself an’
’elped me to carry the boxes into the ’all.”
“The whole nine?” I asked. “Yus; there was five in the first load an’ four in the second. It was
main dry work, an’ I don’t so well remember ’ow I got ’ome.” I
interrupted him:—
“Were the boxes left in the hall?”
“Yus; it was a big ’all, an’ there was nothin’  else in it.” I made one
more attempt to further matters:—
“You didn’ t have any key?”
“Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door
’isself an’ shut it again when I druv off. I don’t remember the last
time—but that was the beer .”
“And you can’ t remember the number of the house?”
“No, sir. But ye needn’t have no difficulty about that.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"It’s a ’igh

know them steps, ’avin’  ’ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers

of them by the shou lder and was like to throw ’im down the steps,
till the lot of them  went away cussin ’.” I thought that with this
description I could find the house, so, having paid my friend for his
information, I started off for Piccadilly . I had gained a new painful
experience; the Count could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes
himself. If so, time was precious; for, now that he had achieved a
certain amount of distribution, he could, by choosing his own time,
complete the task unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I dischar ged my
cab, and walked westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came
across the house described, and was satisfied that this was the next of
the lairs arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had
been long untenante d. The windows were encrusted with dust, and
the shutters were up. All the framewor k was black with time, and
from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away . It was evident that
up to lately there had been a large notice-board in front of the
balcony; it had, however , been roughly torn away , the uprights which
had supported it still remaining. Behind the rails of the balcony I saw
there were some loose boards, whose raw edges looked white. I
would have given a good deal to have been able to see the notice-
board intact, as it would, perhaps, have given some clue to the
ownership of the house. I remembe red my experience of the
investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not but feel that if I
could find the former owner there might be some means discovered
of gaining access to the house. There was at prese nt nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly
side, and nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if
anything could be gathered from this quarter . The mews were active,
the Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two
of the grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me
anything about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it
had lately been taken, but he couldn’ t say from whom. He told me,
however , that up to very lately there had been a notice-board of “For
Sale” up, and that perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy , the house
agents, could tell me something, as he thought he remembered seeing
the name of that firm on the board. I did not wish to seem too eager ,
or to let my informa nt know or guess too much, so, thanking him in
the usual manner , I strolled away . It was now growing dusk, and the
autumn night was closing in, so I did not lose any time. Having
learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy from a directory at
the Berkeley , I was soon at their of fice in Sackville Street. The gentleman who saw me was particu larly suave in manner , but
uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the
Piccadilly house—which throughout our interview he called a
“mansion”—was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought
wider , and paused a few seconds before replying:—
“It is sold, sir .”
“Pardon me,” I said, with equal politen ess, “but I have a special
reason for wishing to know who purchased it.”
Again he paused longer , and raised his eyebrows still more. “It is
sold, sir ,” was again his laconic reply . “Surely ,” I said, “you do not mind letting me know so much.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 199/291“But I do mind,” he answered. “The affairs of their clients are
absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy .” This was
manifestly a prig of the first water , and there was no use arguing with
him. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:—
“Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of
their confidence. I am myself a professional man.” Here I handed
him my card. “In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act
on the part of Lord  Godalming, who wishes to know something of
the property which was, he understood, lately for sale.” These words
put a dif ferent complexion on af fairs. He said:—
“I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker , and especially
would I like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small
matter of renting some chambers for him when he was the
Honourable Arthur Holmwood. If you will let me have his lordship’ s
address I will consu lt the House on the subject, and will, in any case,
communicate with his lordship by to-night’ s post. It will be a
pleasure if we can so far deviate from our rules as to give the
required information to his lordship.”
I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy , so I
thanked him, gave the address at Dr. Seward’ s and came away .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"It was
now dark, and I was tired and hungry . I got a cup of tea at the
Aërated Bread Company and came down to Purfleet by the next
train. I found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale,
but she made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my
heart to think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused
her inquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking
on at our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our
confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of
keeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more
reconciled; or else the very subject seems to have become repugnant
to her, for when any accidental allusion is made she actually
shudders. I am glad we made our resol ution in time, as with such a
feeling as this, our growing knowledge would be torture to her . I could not tell the others of the day’s discovery till we were alone;
so after dinner—foll owed by a little music to save appearances even
amongst ourselves—I took Mina to her room and left her to go to
bed. The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and
clung to me as though she would detain me; but there was much to
be talked of and I came away . Thank God, the ceasing of telling
things has made no dif ference between us.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the
fire in the study . In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply
read it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my
own information; when I had finished Van Helsing said:—
“This has been a great day’s work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we
are on the track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that
house, then our work is near the end. But if there be some missing,
we must search until we find them. Then shall we make our final
coup , and hunt the wretch to his real death.” We all sat silent awhile
and all at once Mr . Morris spoke:—
“Say! how are we going to get into that house?”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 200/291“We got into the other ,” answered Lord Godalming quickly . “But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had
night and a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different
thing to commit burglary in Piccadilly , either by day or night. I
confess I don’t see how we are going to get in unless that agency
duck can find us a key of some sort; perhaps we shall know when
you get his letter in the morning.” Lord Godalming’ s brows
contracted, and he stood up and walked about the room. By-and-by
he stopped and said, turning from one to another of us:—
“Quincey’ s head is level. This burglary business is getting serious;
we got off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand—
unless we can find the Count’ s key basket.”
As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be
at least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from
Mitchell’ s, we decided not to take any active step before breakfast
time. For a good while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in
its various  lights and bearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this
diary right up to the moment.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

"Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular . Her
forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks
even in her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard

will be herself at home in Exeter . Oh, but I am sleepy!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
Dr.,"Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Sewar d’s Diary . 1 October .—I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods
change so rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as
they always mean something more than his own well-being, they
form a more than interesting study . This morning, when I went to see
him after his repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man
commanding destiny . He was, in fact, commanding destiny—
subjectively . He did not really care for any of the things of mere
earth; he was in the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses
and wants  of us poor mortals. I thought I would improve the
occasion and learn something, so I asked him:—
“What about the flies these times?” He smiled on me in quite a
superior sort of way—such a smile as would have become the face of
Malvolio—as he answered me:—
“The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical
of the aërial powers  of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well
when they typified the soul as a butterfly!”
I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically , so I said
quickly:—
“Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?” His madness foiled his
reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head
with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:—
“Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want.” Here he
brightened up; “I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all
right; I have all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor , if you
wish to study zoöphagy!”
This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:—6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 201/291“Then you comman d life; you are a god, I suppose?” He smiled
with an inef fably benign superiority . “Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of
the Deity . I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things
purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied
spiritually!” This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall
Enoch’ s appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt
that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:—
“And why with Enoch?”
“Because he walked with God.” I could not see the analogy , but
did not like to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:—
“So you don’t care about life and you don’t want souls. Why not?”
I put my question quickly and somew hat sternly , on purpose to
disconcert him. The effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously
relapsed into his old servile manner , bent low before me, and
actually fawned upon me as he replied:—
“I don’t want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don’t.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I couldn’ t use
them if I had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn’ t
eat them or——” He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look
spread over his face, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water . “And doctor , as to life, what is it after all? When you’ve got all you
require, and you know that you will never want, that is all. I have
friends—good friends—like you, Dr. Seward”; this was said with a
leer of inexpressible cunning. “I know  that I shall never lack the
means of life!”
I think that through  the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some
antagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such
as he—a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present
it was useless to speak to him. He was sulky , and so I came away . Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinar ily I would not have come
without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him
that I would gladly  make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have
anything to help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues;
and so are Lord Godalming and Quincey . Van Helsing sits in my
study poring over the record prepared by the Harkers; he seems to
think that by accurate knowledge of all details he will light upon
some clue. He does not wish to be disturbed in the work, without
cause. I would have taken him with me to see the patient, only I
thought that after his last repulse he might not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield might not speak so freely
before a third person as when he and I were alone. I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a
pose which is genera lly indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I came in, he said at once, as though the question had been
waiting on his lips:—
“What about souls?” It was evident then that my surmise had been
correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the
lunatic. I determined to have the matter out.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"“What about them
yourself?” I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all
round him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some
inspiration for an answer .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 202/291“I don’t want any souls!” he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The
matter seemed preyi ng on his mind, and so I determined to use it—to
“be cruel only to be kind.” So I said:—
“You like life, and you want life?”
“Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn’ t worry about that!”
“But,” I asked, “how  are we to get the life without getting the soul
also?” This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:—
“A nice time you’ll have some time when you’re flying out there,
with the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats
buzzing and twittering and miauing all round you. You’ve got their
lives, you know , and you must put up with their souls!” Something
seemed to affect his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears
and shut his eyes, screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does
when his face is being soaped. There was something pathetic in it
that touch ed me; it also gave me a lesson, for it seemed that before
me was a child—only a child, though the features were worn, and the
stubble on the jaws was white. It was evident that he was under going
some process of mental disturbance, and, knowing how his past
moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself, I thought
I would enter into his mind as well as I could and go with him. The
first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him, speaking pretty
loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:—
“Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?” He
seemed to wake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he
replied:—
“Not much! flies are poor things, after all!” After a pause he
added, “But I don’ t want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.”
“Or spiders?” I went on. “Blow spiders! What’ s the use of spider s? There isn’t anything in
them to eat or”—h e stopped suddenly , as though reminded of a
forbidden topic. “So, so!” I thought to myself, “this is the second time he has
suddenly stopped at the word ‘drink’; what does it mean?” Renfield
seemed himself aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as
though to distract my attention from it:—
“I don’t take any stock at all in such matters. ‘Rats and mice and
such small deer,’ as Shakespeare has it, ‘chicken-feed of the larder ’
they might be called . I’m past all that sort of nonsense. You might as
well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try
to interest  me about the lesser carnivo ra, when I know of what is
before me.”
“I see,” I said. “You want big things that you can make your teeth
meet in? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?”
“What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!” He was getting too
wide awake, so I thought I would press  him hard. “I wonder ,” I said
reflectively , “what an elephant’ s soul is like!”
The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his
high-horse and became a child again. “I don’t want an elephant’ s soul, or any soul at all!” he said. For a
few moments he sat despondently . Suddenly he jumped to his feet,
with his eyes blazing  and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 203/291“To hell with you and your souls!” he shouted. “Why do you plague
me about souls? Haven’ t I got enough to worry , and pain, and
distract me already , without thinking of souls!” He looked so hostile
that I thought he was in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my
whistle. The instant,  however , that I did so he became calm, and said
apologetically:—
“Forgive me, Docto r; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I
am so worried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only
knew the problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you
would pity, and tolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a
strait-waistcoat. I want to think and I cannot think freely when my
body is confined. I am sure you will understand!” He had evidently
self-control; so when the attendants came I told them not to mind,
and they withdrew . Renfield watched them go; when the door was
closed he said, with considerable dignity and sweetness:—
“Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe
me that I am very, very grateful to you!” I thought it well to leave
him in this mood, and so I came away . There is certainly something
to ponder over in this man’ s state. Several points seem to make what
the American interviewer calls “a story ,” if one could only get them
in proper order . Here they are:—
Will not mention “drinking.”
Fears the thought of being burdened with the “soul” of anything. Has no dread of wanting “life” in the future. Despises the meaner forms of life altogether , though he dreads
being haunted by their souls. Logically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some
kind that he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the
consequence—the burden of a soul. Then it is a human life he looks
to! And the assurance—? Merciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new
scheme of terror afoot! Later .—I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my
suspicion. He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over
for a while asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to
the door we heard the lunatic within singing gaily , as he used to do in
the time which now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw
with amazement that he had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies,
lethar gic with the autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We
tried to make him talk of the subject of our previous conversation,
but he would not attend. He went on with his singing, just as though
we had not been present. He had got a scrap of paper and was
folding it into a note-book. We had to come away as ignorant as we
went in. His is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night. Letter , Mitchell, Sons and Candy to Lor d Godalming. “1 October . “My Lord,6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

Dr. Sewar d’s Diary . 2 October.—I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him
to make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield’ s
room, and gave him instructions that if there should be anything
strange he was to call me. After dinne r, when we had all gathered
round the fire in the study—Mrs. Harker having gone to bed—we
discussed the attempts and discoveries of the day. Harker was the
only one who had any result, and we are in great hopes that his clue
may be an important one. Before going to bed I went round to the patient’ s room and looked
in through  the observation trap. He was sleeping soundly , and his
heart rose and fell with regular respiration. This morn ing the man on duty reporte d to me that a little after
midnight he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat
loudly . I asked him if that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There was something about his manne r so suspicious that I asked
him point blank if he had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted
to having “dozed” for a while. It is too bad that men cannot be
trusted unless they are watched. To-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey
are looking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to
have horses always in readiness, for when we get the information
which we seek there will be no time to lose. We must sterilise all the
imported earth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the
Count at his weakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is
off to the British Museum looking up some authorities on ancient
medicine. The old physicians took account of things which their
followers do not accept, and the Professor is searching for witch and
demon cures which may be useful to us later . I sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to

DR. SEWARD’S DIARY
3 October .—Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as
well as I can remember it, since last I made an entry . Not a detail that
I can recall must be for gotten; in all calmness I must proceed. When I came to Renfield’ s room I found him lying on the floor on
his left side in a glittering pool of blood . When I went to move him,
it became  at once apparent that he had received some terrible
injuries; there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the
parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity . As the face was
exposed I could see that it was horribly bruised, as though it had
been beate n against the floor—indeed it was from the face wounds
that the pool of blood originated. The attendant who was kneeling
beside the body said to me as we turned him over:—
“I think, sir, his back  is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and
the whole  side of his face are paralyse d.” How such a thing could
have happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed
quite bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:—
“I can’t understand the two things. He could mark his face like
that by beating his own head on the floor . I saw a young woman do it
once at the Eversfiel d Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he might have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if
he got in an awkwa rd kink. But for the life of me I can’t imagine
how the two things occurred. If his back was broke, he couldn’ t beat
his head; and if his face was like that before the fall out of bed, there
would be marks of it.” I said to him:—
“Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want him without an instant’ s delay .” The man ran off, and within a
few minutes the Professor , in his dressing gown and slippers,
appeared. When he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at
him a moment, and then turned to me. I think he recognised my
thought in my eyes, for he said very quietly, manifestly for the ears
of the attendant:—
“Ah, a sad acciden t! He will need very careful watching, and
much attention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress
myself. If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.”
The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see
that he had suffered  some terrible injury . Van Helsing returned with
extraordinary celerity , bearing with him a surgical case. He had
evidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost
before he looked at the patient, he whispered to me:—
“Send the attendant away . We must be alone with him when he
becomes conscious, after the operation.” So I said:—
“I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can
at present.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"You had better go your round, and Dr.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Van Helsing will
operate. Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual
anywhere.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 207/291The man withdrew , and we went into a strict examination of the
patient. The wounds  of the face was superficial; the real injury was a
depressed fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor
area. The Professor thought a moment and said:—
“We must  reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions,
as far as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible
nature of his injury . The whole moto r area seems affected. The
suffusion of the brain will increase quickly , so we must trephine at
once or it may be too late.” As he was speaking there was a soft
tapping at the door. I went over and opened it and found in the
corridor without, Arthur and Quincey in pajamas and slippers: the
former spoke:—
“I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an
accident. So I woke  Quincey or rather called for him as he was not
asleep. Things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound
sleep for any of us these times. I’ve been thinking that to-morrow
night will not see things as they have been. We’ll have to look back
—and forward a little more than we have done. May we come in?” I
nodded, and held the door open till they had entered; then I closed it
again. When Quincey saw the attitude and state of the patient, and
noted the horrible pool on the floor , he said softly:—
“My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!” I told
him briefly , and added that we expected he would recover
consciousness after the operation—for a short time, at all events. He
went at once and sat down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming
beside him; we all watched in patience. “We shall  wait,” said Van Helsing, “just long enough to fix the
best spot for trephin ing, so that we may most quickly and perfectly
remove the blood clot; for it is evident that the hæmorrhage is
increasing.”
The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful
slowness. I had a horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van
Helsing’ s face I gathered that he felt some fear or apprehension as to
what was to come. I dreaded the words that Renfield might speak. I
was positively afraid to think; but the conviction of what was coming
was on me, as I have read of men who have heard the death-watch. The poor man’ s breathing came in uncertain gasps. Each instant he
seemed as though he would open his eyes and speak; but then would
follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he would relapse into a
more fixed  insensib ility. Inured as I was to sick beds and death, this
suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost hear the beating of
my own heart; and the blood surging through my temples sounded
like blows from a hammer . The silence finally became agonising. I
looked at my comp anions, one after another , and saw from their
flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead some
dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect it. At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was
sinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the
Professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set
as he spoke:—6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 208/291“There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I
have been  thinking so, as I stood here.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"It may be there is a soul at
stake! We shall operate just above the ear .”
Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments
the breathi ng continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so
prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest. Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare. This was continued for a few moments ; then it softened into a glad
surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved
convulsively , and as he did so, said:—
“I’ll be quiet, Doctor . Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I
have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot
move. What’ s wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts
dreadfully .” He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his
eyes seem ed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van
Helsing said in a quiet grave tone:—
“Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield.” As he heard the voice his face
brightened, through its mutilation, and he said:—
“That is Dr. Van Helsing.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"How good it is of you to be here. Give
me some water , my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I
dreamed”—he stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to
Quincey—“The brandy—it is in my study—quick!” He flew and
returned with a glass, the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water . We moistened the parched lips, and the patient quickly revived. It
seemed, however , that his poor injured brain had been working in the
interval, for, when he was quite conscious, he looked at me
piercingly with an agonised confusion which I shall never forget, and
said:—
“I must not deceiv e myself; it was no dream, but all a grim
reality .” Then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of
the two figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:—
“If I were not sure already , I would know from them.” For an
instant his eyes closed—not with pain or sleep but voluntarily , as
though he were bringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened
them he said, hurriedly , and with more energy than he had yet
displayed:—
“Quick, Doctor , quick. I am dying!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I feel that I have but a few
minutes; and then I must go back to death—or worse! Wet my lips
with brand y again. I have something that I must say before I die; or
before my poor crushed brain dies anyhow . Thank you! It was that
night after you left me, when I implor ed you to let me go away . I
couldn’ t speak then, for I felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane
then, except in that way, as I am now. I was in an agony of despair
for a long time after you left me; it seem ed hours. Then there came a
sudden peace to me. My brain seemed to become cool again, and I
realised where I was. I heard the dogs bark behind our house, but not
where He was!” As he spoke, Van Helsing’s eyes never blinked, but
his hand came out and met mine and gripped it hard. He did not,
however , betray himself; he nodded slightly and said: “Go on,” in a
low voice. Renfield proceeded:—
“He came  up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often
before; but he was solid then—not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 209/291like a man’s when angry . He was laugh ing with his red mouth; the
sharp white teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look
back over the belt of trees, to where the dogs were barking. I
wouldn’ t ask him to come in at first, though I knew he wanted to—
just as he had wanted all along. Then he began promising me things
—not in words but by doing them.” He was interrupted by a word
from the Professor:—
“How?”
“By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when
the sun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on
their wings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones
on their backs.” Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me
unconsciously:—
“The Acher ontia Aitetr opos of the Sphinges —what you call the
‘Death’ s-head Moth’?” The patient went on without stopping. “Then he began to whisper: ‘Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,
millions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats
too. All lives! all red blood, with years  of life in it; and not merely
buzzing flies!’  I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could
do. Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He beckoned me to the window . I got up and looked out, and He
raised his hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A
dark mass spread over the grass, coming  on like the shape of a flame
of fire; and then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could
see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red—
like His, only smaller . He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and
I thought he seemed  to be saying: ‘All these lives will I give you, ay,
and many more and greater , through countless ages, if you will fall
down and worship me!’ And then a red cloud, like the colour of
blood, seemed to close over my eyes; and before I knew what I was
doing, I found myself opening the sash and saying to Him: ‘Come in,
Lord and Master!’  The rats were all gone, but He slid into the room
through the sash, though it was only open an inch wide—just as the
Moon herself has often come in through the tiniest crack and has
stood before me in all her size and splendour .”
His voice was weaker, so I moistened  his lips with the brandy
again, and he contin ued; but it seemed  as though his memory had
gone on working in the interval for his story was further advanced. I
was about to call him back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered
to me: “Let him go on. Do not interrupt him; he cannot go back, and
maybe could not proceed at all if once he lost the thread of his
thought.” He proceeded:—
“All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me
anything, not even a blow-fly , and when the moon got up I was
pretty angry with him. When he slid in through the window , though
it was shut, and did not even knock, I got mad with him. He sneered
at me, and his white face looked out of the mist with his red eyes
gleaming, and he went on as though he owned the whole place, and I
was no one. He didn’t even smell the same as he went by me. I
couldn’ t hold him.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I thought that, somehow , Mrs. Harker had come
into the room.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 210/291The two men sitting  on the bed stood up and came over, standing
behind him so that he could not see them, but where they could hear
better . They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered;
his face, however , grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on
without noticing:—
“When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn’ t
the same; it was like tea after the teapot had been watered.” Here we
all moved, but no one said a word; he went on:—
“I didn’ t know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn’ t look
the same. I don’t care for the pale people; I like them with lots of
blood in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn’ t think
of it at the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it
made me mad to know that He had been taking the life out of her.” I
could feel that the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise
still. “So when He came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist
stealing in, and I grabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have
unnatural strength; and as I knew I was a madman—at times anyhow
—I resolved to use my power . Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to
come out of the mist to struggle with me. I held tight; and I thought I
was going to win, for I didn’ t mean Him to take any more of her life,
till I saw His eyes. They burned into me, and my strength became
like water . He slipped through it, and when I tried to cling to Him,
He raised me up and flung me down. There was a red cloud before
me, and a noise like thunder , and the mist seemed to steal away
under the door.” His voice was becomin g fainter and his breath more
stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively . “We know  the worst now,” he said. “He is here, and we know his
purpose. It may not be too late. Let us be armed—the same as we
were the other night, but lose no time; there is not an instant to
spare.” There was no need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into
words—we shared them in common. We all hurried and took from
our rooms the same things that we had when we entered the Count’ s
house. The Professor had his ready , and as we met in the corridor he
pointed to them significantly as he said:—
“They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy
business is over. Be wise also, my friends.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"It is no common enemy
that we deal with. Alas!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"alas! that that dear Madam Mina should
suffer!” He stopped ; his voice was breaking, and I do not know if
rage or terror predominated in my own heart. Outside the Harkers’  door we paused. Art and Quincey held back,
and the latter said:—
“Should we disturb her?”
“We must, ” said Van Helsing grimly . “If the door be locked, I shall
break it in.”
“May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a
lady’ s room!”
Van Helsi ng said solemnly , “You are always right; but this is life
and death. All cham bers are alike to the doctor; and even were they
not they are all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the
handle, if the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down
and shove; and you too, my friends. Now!”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 211/291He turned  the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We
threw ourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost
fell headlo ng into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I
saw acros s him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw appalled me.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back
of my neck, and my heart seemed to stand still. The moonlight was so bright that throu gh the thick yellow blind
the room was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay
Jonathan Harker , his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in
a stupor. Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was
the white- clad figur e of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man,
clad in black. His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we
all recogn ised the Count—in every way, even to the scar on his
forehead. With his left hand he held both Mrs. Harker ’s hands,
keeping them away with her arms at full tension; his right hand
gripped her by the back of the neck, forcing her face down on his
bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin
stream trickled down the man’ s bare breast which was shown by his
torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to
a child forcing a kitten’ s nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to
drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his face, and the
hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap into it. His
eyes flame d red with devilish passion; the great nostrils of the white
aquiline nose opened wide and quivere d at the edge; and the white
sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,
champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which
threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height,
he turned and sprang  at us. But by this time the Professor had gained
his feet, and was holding towards him the envelope which contained
the Sacred  Wafer. The Count suddenly  stopped, just as poor Lucy
had done outside the tomb, and cower ed back. Further and further
back he cowered, as we, lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The
moonlight suddenly  failed, as a great black cloud sailed across the
sky; and when the gaslight sprang up under Quincey’ s match, we
saw nothing but a faint vapour . This, as we looked, trailed under the
door, which with the recoil from its bursting open, had swung back
to its old position.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Van Helsing, Art, and I moved forward to Mrs. Harker , who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given
a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it seems to me
now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a few seconds
she lay in her helpl ess attitude and disarray . Her face was ghastly ,
with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her
lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of
blood; her eyes were mad with terror . Then she put before her face
her poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark
of the Count’ s terrible grip, and from  behind them came a low
desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick
expression of an endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and
drew the coverlet gently over her body , whilst Art, after looking at
her face for an instant despairingly , ran out of the room. Van Helsing
whispered to me:—
“Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can
produce. We can do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few
moments till she recovers herself; I must wake him!” He dipped the6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 212/291end of a towel in cold water and with it began to flick him on the
face, his wife all the while holding her face between her hands and
sobbing in a way that was heart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind,
and looked out of the window . There was much moonshine; and as I
looked I could see Quincey Morris run across the lawn and hide
himself in the shadow of a great yew-tree. It puzzled me to think
why he was doing this; but at the instant I heard Harker ’s quick
exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness, and turned to the
bed. On his face, as there might well be, was a look of wild
amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and then full
consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he started
up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to him
with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly ,
however , she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together ,
held her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath
her shook. “In God’s name what does this mean?” Harker cried out. “Dr. Seward, Dr. Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened?","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"What is
wrong? Mina, dear, what is it? What does that blood mean? My God,
my God! has it come to this!” and, raising himself to his knees, he
beat his hands wildly together . “Good God help us! help her! oh,
help her!”  With a quick movement he jumped from bed, and began
to pull on his clothes,—all the man in him awake at the need for
instant exertion. “What has happened? Tell me all about it!” he cried
without pausing. “Dr. Van Helsing, you love Mina, I know . Oh, do
something to save her.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"It cannot have gone too far yet. Guard her
while I look for him!” His wife, through her terror and horror and
distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly forgetting her own
grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:—
“No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough
to-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You
must stay with me. Stay with these friends who will watch over
you!” Her expression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding
to her, she pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him
fiercely . Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up
his little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:—
“Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you
no foul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be
calm and take counsel together .” She shuddered and was silent,
holding down her head on her husband’ s breast. When she raised it,
his white night-rob e was stained with blood where her lips had
touched, and where the thin open woun d in her neck had sent forth
drops. The instant she saw it she drew  back, with a low wail, and
whispered, amidst choking sobs:—
“Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that
it should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy , and whom he
may have most cause to fear .” To this he spoke out resolutely:—
“Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I would
not hear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge
me by my deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than
even this hour, if by any act or will of mine anything ever come
between us!” He put out his arms and folded her to his breast; and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 213/291for a while she lay there sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed
head, with eyes that blinked damply above his quivering nostrils; his
mouth was set as steel. After a while her sobs became less frequent
and more faint, and then he said to me, speaking with a studied
calmness which I felt tried his nervous power to the utmost:—
“And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the
broad fact; tell me all that has been.” I told him exactly what had
happened, and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his
nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands
of the Count had held his wife in that terrible and horrid position,
with her mouth to the open wound in his breast. It interested me,
even at that moment, to see, that, whilst  the face of white set passion
worked convulsively over the bowed head, the hands tenderly and
lovingly stroked the ruffled hair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and
Godalming knocked  at the door. They entered in obedience to our
summons. Van Helsing looked at me questioningly . I understood him
to mean if we were to take advantage of their coming to divert if
possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from each
other and from them selves; so on nodding acquiescence to him he
asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming
answered:—
“I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our
rooms. I looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had
gone. He had, however——” He stopped suddenly , looking at the
poor drooping figure on the bed. Van Helsing said gravely:—
“Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our
hope now is in knowing all. Tell freely!” So Art went on:—
“He had been there,  and though it could only have been for a few
seconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had been
burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes;
the cylind ers of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and
the wax had helped  the flames.” Here  I interrupted. “Thank God
there is the other copy in the safe!” His face lit for a moment, but fell
again as he went on: “I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of
him. I looked into Renfield’ s room; but there was no trace there
except——!” Again he paused. “Go on,” said Harker hoarsely; so he
bowed his head and moistening his lips with his tongue, added:
“except that the poor fellow is dead.” Mrs. Harker raised her head,
looking from one to the other of us she said solemnly:—
“God’ s will be done!” I could not but feel that Art was keeping
back something; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said
nothing. Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:—
“And you, friend Quincey , have you any to tell?”
“A little,” he answer ed. “It may be much eventually , but at present
I can’t say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count
would go when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat
rise from Renfield’ s window , and flap westward. I expected to see
him in some shape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some
other lair. He will not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in
the east, and the dawn is close. We must work to-morrow!”
He said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of
perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 214/291I could hear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said,
placing his hand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker ’s head:—
“And now, Madam Mina—poor , dear, dear Madam Mina—tell us
exactly what happen ed. God knows that I do not want that you be
pained; but it is need that we know all. For now more than ever has
all work to be done quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day
is close to us that must end all, if it may be so; and now is the chance
that we may live and learn.”
The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her
nerves as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head
lower and lower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly ,
and held out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after
stooping and kissing it reverently , held it fast. The other hand was
locked in that of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round
her protectingly . After a pause in which she was evidently ordering
her thoughts, she began:—
“I took the sleeping  draught which you had so kindly given me,
but for a long time it did not act. I seem ed to become more wakeful,
and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind—
all of them connec ted with death, and vampires; with blood, and
pain, and trouble.” Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned
to him and said lovingly: “Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and
strong, and help me through the horrible  task. If you only knew what
an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would
understand how much I need your help. Well, I saw I must try to help
the medici ne to its work with my will, if it was to do me any good,
so I resolutely set myself to sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have
come to me, for I remember no more. Jonathan coming in had not
waked me, for he lay by my side when next I remember . There was
in the room  the same thin white mist that I had before noticed. But I
forget now if you know of this; you will find it in my diary which I
shall show  you later. I felt the same vague terror which had come to
me before  and the same sense of some  presence. I turned to wake
Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it
was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I tried, but I
could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I looked
around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside the
bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist—or rather as if the mist had
turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared—stood a tall,
thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of the
others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light
fell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth
showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the
sunset on the windows of St. Mary’ s Church at Whitby . I knew , too,
the red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an
instant my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that
I was paralysed. In the pause he spok e in a sort of keen, cutting
whisper , pointing as he spoke to Jonathan:—
“‘Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his
brains out before your very eyes.’  I was appalled and was too
bewildered to do or say anything. With a mocking smile, he placed
one hand upon my shoulder and, holdin g me tight, bared my throat

time, or the second, that your veins have appeased my thirst!’  I was
bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not want to hinder him. I
suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that such is, when his touch
is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity me! He placed his
reeking lips upon my throat!” Her husband groaned again. She
clasped his hand harder , and looked at him pityingly , as if he were
the injured one, and went on:—
“I felt my strength fading away , and I was in a half swoon. How
long this horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long
time must  have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering
mouth away . I saw it drip with the fresh blood!” The remembrance
seemed for a while  to overpower her, and she drooped and would
have sunk down but for her husband’ s sustaining arm. With a great
effort she recovered herself and went on:—
“Then he spoke to me mockingly , ‘And so you, like the others,
would play your brains against mine. You would help these men to
hunt me and frustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they
know in part already , and will know in full before long, what it is to
cross my path. They should have kept their energies for use closer to
home. Whilst they played wits against me—against me who
commanded nations, and intrigued for them, and fought for them,
hundreds of years before they were born—I was countermining
them. And you, their best beloved one, are now to me, flesh of my
flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful wine-press for
a while; and shall be later on my companion and my helper . You
shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall minister to
your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what you have
done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my
call. When my brain says “Come!” to you, you shall cross land or sea
to do my bidding; and to that end this!’  With that he pulled open his
shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When
the blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding
them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth
to the wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the

pollution. As she was telling her terrible story , the eastern sky began to
quicken, and everything became more and more clear . Harker was
still and quiet; but over his face, as the awful narrative went on,

JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL
3 October.—As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary . It is now six o’clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour
and take something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are
agreed that if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will
be, God knows, required to-day . I must keep writing at every chance,
for I dare not stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps
at the end the little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or
little, could not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are
to-day . However , we must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just
now, with the tears running down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble
and trial that our faith is tested—that we must keep on trusting; and
that God will aid us up to the end. The end!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
oh my God! what end?... To work! To work! When Dr.,"Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing
poor Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to
the room below they had found Renfield lying on the floor , all in a
heap. His face was all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the
neck were broken. Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if
he had heard anythi ng. He said that he had been sitting down—he
confessed to half dozing—when he heard loud voices in the room,
and then Renfield had called out loudl y several times, “God! God! God!” after that there was a sound of falling, and when he entered
the room he found him lying on the floor , face down, just as the
doctors had seen him. Van Helsing asked if he had heard “voices” or
“a voice,”  and he said he could not say; that at first it had seemed to
him as if there were two, but as there was no one in the room it could
have been only one. He could swear to it, if required, that the word
“God” was spoken by the patient. Dr. Seward said to us, when we
were alone, that he did not wish to go into the matter; the question of
an inquest had to be considered, and it would never do to put forward
the truth, as no one would believe it. As it was, he thought that on the
attendant’ s evidenc e he could give a certificate of death by
misadventure in falling from bed. In case the coroner should demand
it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily to the same result. When the question began to be discusse d as to what should be our
next step, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in
full confid ence; that nothing of any sort—no matter how painful—
should be kept from  her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it
was pitifu l to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a
depth of despair . “There must be no concealment,” she said, “Alas! we have had too much already . And besides there is nothing in all the
world that can give me more pain than I have already endured—than
I suffer now! Whate ver may happen, it must be of new hope or of6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 217/291new courage to me!” Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she
spoke, and said, suddenly but quietly:—
“But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but
for others from yourself, after what has happened?” Her face grew
set in its lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as
she answered:—
“Ah no! for my mind is made up!”
“To what?” he asked  gently , whilst we were all very still; for each
in our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her
answer came with direct simplicity , as though she were simply
stating a fact:—
“Because if I find in myself—and I shall watch keenly for it—a
sign of harm to any that I love, I shall die!”
“You would not kill yourself?” he asked, hoarsely . “I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save
me such a pain, and so desperate an effort!” She looked at him
meaningly as she spoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and
came close to her and put his hand on her head as he said solemnly:
“My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For
myself I could hold it in my account with God to find such an
euthanasia for you, even at this momen t if it were best. Nay, were it
safe! But my child— —” For a moment he seemed choked, and a
great sob rose in his throat; he gulped it down and went on:—
“There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not die. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by
your own. Until the other , who has fouled your sweet life, is true
dead you must not die; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your
death would make you even as he is. No, you must live! You must
struggle and strive to live, though death would seem a boon
unspeakable. You must fight Death himself, though he come to you
in pain or in joy; by the day, or the night; in safety or in peril! On
your living soul I charge you that you do not die—nay , nor think of
death—till this great evil be past.” The poor dear grew white as
death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a quicksand shake and
shiver at the incomi ng of the tide. We were all silent; we could do
nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to him said,
sweetly , but oh! so sorrowfully , as she held out her hand:—
“I promise  you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall
strive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may
have passed away from me.” She was so good and brave that we all
felt that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and
we began to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to
have all the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and
phonographs we might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as
she had done before. She was pleased with the prospect of anything
to do—if “pleased” could be used in connection with so grim an
interest. As usual Van Helsin g had thought ahead of everyone else, and was
prepared with an exact ordering of our work. “It is perhaps well,”  he said, “that at our meeting after our visit to
Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay
there. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose,6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 218/291and would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate
such an effort with regard to the others; but now he does not know
our intentions. Nay, more, in all probab ility, he does not know that
such a power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot
use them as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our
knowledge as to their disposition that, when we have examined the
house in Piccadilly , we may track the very last of them. To-day , then,
is ours; and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this
morning guards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster
must retain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the
limitations of his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor
disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a
doorway , he must open the door like a mortal. And so we have this
day to hunt out all his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have
not yet catch him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place
where the catching and the destroying shall be, in time, sure.” Here I
started up for I could not contain myself at the thought that the
minutes and seconds so preciously laden with Mina’ s life and
happiness were flying from us, since whilst we talked action was
impossible. But Van Helsing held up his hand warningly . “Nay ,
friend Jonathan,” he said, “in this, the quickest way home is the
longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all act and act with
desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in all probable
the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly . The Count may
have many  houses which he has bought . Of them he will have deeds
of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he write
on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings that
he must have somew here; why not in this place so central, so quiet,
where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in
the very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there
and search that hous e; and when we learn what it holds, then we do
what our friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt ‘stop the earths’
and so we run down our old fox—so? is it not?”
“Then let us come at once,” I cried, “we are wasting the precious,
precious time!” The Professor did not move, but simply said:—
“And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?”
“Any way!” I cried. “W e shall break in if need be.”
“And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?”
I was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a
good reason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:—
“Don’ t wait more than need be; you know , I am sure, what torture
I am in.”
“Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add
to your anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be
at movement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought,
and it seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we
wish to get into the house, but we have no key; is it not so?” I
nodded. “Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house,
and could not still get in; and think there was to you no conscience of
the housebreaker , what would you do?”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 219/291“I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick
the lock for me.”
“And your police, they would interfere, would they not?”
“Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.”
“Then,” he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, “all that is in
doubt is the conscience of the employer , and the belief of your
policemen as to whether or no that employer has a good conscience
or a bad one. Your police must indeed be zealous men and clever—
oh, so clever!—in reading the heart, that they trouble themselves in
such matte r. No, no, my friend Jonatha n, you go take the lock off a
hundred empty house in this your London, or of any city in the
world; and if you do it as such things are rightly done, and at the
time such things are rightly done, no one will interfere. I have read
of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in London, and when he
went for months of summer to Switzerland and lock up his house,
some burglar came and broke window at back and got in. Then he
went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in
through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he have an
auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice; and
when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of
that other man who own them. Then he go to a builder , and he sell
him that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take
all away within a certain time. And your police and other authority
help him all they can. And when that owner come back from his
holiday in Switzerla nd he find only an empty hole where his house
had been. This was all done en règle ; and in our work we shall be en
règle  too. We shall not go so early that the policemen who have then
little to think of, shall deem it strange; but we shall go after ten
o’clock, when there are many about, and such things would be done
were we indeed owners of the house.”
I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of
Mina’ s face became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good
counsel. Van Helsing went on:—
“When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate
some of us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places
where there be more earth-boxes—at Bermondsey and Mile End.”
Lord Goda lming stood up.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"“I can be of some use here,” he said. “I
shall wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will
be most convenient.”
“Look here, old fellow ,” said Morris, “it is a capital idea to have
all ready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don’t you think
that one of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a
byway of Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for
our purposes? It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go
south or east; and even leave them somewhere near the
neighbourhood we are going to.”
“Friend Quincey is right!” said the Professor .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"“His head is what
you call in plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go to
do, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may .”
Mina took a growin g interest in everything and I was rejoiced to
see that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time
the terrible  experience of the night. She was very, very pale—almost6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 220/291ghastly , and so thin that her lips were drawn away , showing her teeth
in somewhat of prom inence. I did not mention this last, lest it should
give her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to
think of what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had
sucked her blood. As yet there was no sign of the teeth growing
sharper; but the time as yet was short, and there was time for fear .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and
of the disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It
was finally agreed that before startin g for Piccadilly we should
destroy the Count’ s lair close at hand. In case he should find it out
too soon, we should thus be still ahead of him in our work of
destruction; and his presence in his purely material shape, and at his
weakest, might give us some new clue. As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that,
after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly;
that the two docto rs and I should remain there, whilst Lord
Godalming and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End
and destro yed them. It was possible, if not likely , the Professor
urged, that the Coun t might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and
that if so we might be able to cope with him then and there. At any
rate, we might be able to follow him in force. To this plan I
strenuously objected, and so far as my going was concerned, for I
said that I intended to stay and protect Mina, I thought that my mind
was made up on the subject; but Mina would not listen to my
objection. She said that there might be some law matter in which I
could be useful; that amongst the Count’ s papers might be some clue
which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania; and
that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to cope
with the Count’ s extraordinary power . I had to give in, for Mina’ s
resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for her that we
should all work together . “As for me,” she said, “I have no fear. Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen
must have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one
present.” So I started up crying out: “Then in God’ s name let us
come at once, for we are losing time. The Count may come to
Piccadilly earlier than we think.”
“Not so!” said Van Helsing, holding up his hand. “But why?” I asked. “Do you forget,” he said, with actually a smile, “that last night he
banqueted heavily , and will sleep late?”
Did I forget! shall I ever—can I ever! Can any of us ever forget
that terrib le scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave
countenance; but the pain overmastered her and she put her hands
before her face, and shuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had
not intended to recall her frightful experience. He had simply lost
sight of her and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort. When it
struck him what he said, he was horrifie d at his thoughtlessness and
tried to comfort her. “Oh, Madam Mina, ” he said, “dear , dear Madam
Mina, alas! that I of all who so reverence you should have said
anything so forgetfu l. These stupid old lips of mine and this stupid
old head do not deserve so; but you will forget it, will you not?” He6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 221/291bent low beside her as he spoke; she took his hand, and looking at
him through her tears, said hoarsely:—
“No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I
have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all
together . Now , you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready , and
we must all eat that we may be strong.”
Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and
encourage each other , and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful
of us. When it was over , Van Helsing stood up and said:—
“Now , my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are
we all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our
enemy’ s lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?” We all
assured him. “Then  it is well. Now , Madam Mina, you are in any
case quite  safe here until the sunset; and before then we shall return
—if—— We shall return! But before we go let me see you armed
against personal attack. I have myse lf, since you came down,
prepared your chamber by the placing of things of which we know ,
so that He may not enter . Now let me guard yourself. On your
forehead I touch this piece of Sacred  Wafer in the name of the
Father , the Son, and——”
There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he had placed the Wafer on Mina’ s forehead, it had seared it—
had burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot
metal. My poor darling’ s brain had told her the significance of the
fact as quickly as her nerves received the pain of it; and the two so
overwhelmed her that her overwrought  nature had its voice in that
dreadful scream. But the words to her thought came quickly; the
echo of the scream had not ceased to ring on the air when there came
the reactio n, and she sank on her knees  on the floor in an agony of
abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair over her face, as the leper of
old his mantle, she wailed out:—
“Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I
must bear this mark  of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment
Day.” They all pause d. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of
helpless grief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few
minutes our sorrowful hearts beat togeth er, whilst the friends around
us turned away their eyes that ran tears silently . Then Van Helsing
turned and said gravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that
he was in some way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:
—
“It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself
see fit, as He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all
wrongs of the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be
there to see, when that red scar, the sign of God’ s knowledge of what
has been, shall pass away , and leave your forehead as pure as the
heart we know . For so surely as we live, that scar shall pass away
when God sees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us. Till then
we bear our Cross, as His Son did in obedience to His Will. It may
be that we are chosen instruments of His good pleasure, and that we
ascend to His bidding as that other through stripes and shame;
through tears and blood; through doubts and fears, and all that makes
the dif ference between God and man.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 222/291There was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for
resignation. Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each
took one of the old man’ s hands and bent over and kissed it. Then
without a word we all knelt down together , and, all holding hands,
swore to be true to each other . We men pledged ourselves to raise the
veil of sorrow from the head of her whom, each in his own way, we
loved; and we prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which
lay before us. It was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a parting
which neither of us shall for get to our dying day; and we set out. To one thing I have  made up my mind: if we find out that Mina
must be a vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that
unknown and terrible land alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times
one vampire meant many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest
in sacred earth, so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for
their ghastly ranks. We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same
as on the first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so
prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any
ground for such fear as already we knew . Had not our minds been
made up, and had there not been terrible  memories to spur us on, we
could hardly have proceeded with our task. We found no papers, or
any sign of use in the house; and in the old chapel the great boxes
looked just as we had seen them last. Dr. Van Helsing said to us
solemnly as we stood before them:—
“And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must
sterilise this earth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought
from a far distant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth
because it has been holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon,
for we make it more holy still. It was sanctified to such use of man,
now we sanctify it to God.” As he spoke he took from his bag a
screwdriver and a wrench, and very soon the top of one of the cases
was thrown open. The earth smelled musty and close; but we did not
somehow seem to mind, for our attention was concentrated on the
Professor . Taking from his box a piece of the Sacred Wafer he laid it
reverently on the earth, and then shutting down the lid began to
screw it home, we aiding him as he worked. One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes,
and left them as we had found them to all appearance; but in each
was a portion of the Host. When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:
—
“So much is already  done. If it may be that with all the others we
can be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on
Madam Mina’ s forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!”
As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch
our train we could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly , and
in the window of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her,
and nodd ed to tell that our work there was successfully
accomplished. She nodded in reply to show that she understood. The
last I saw, she was waving her hand in farewell. It was with a heavy6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 223/291heart that we sought the station and just caught the train, which was
steaming in as we reached the platform. I have written this in the train.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Piccadilly , 12:30 o’clock. —Just before we reached Fenchurch
Street Lord Godalming said to me:—
“Quincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come
with us in case there should be any difficulty; for under the
circumstances it wouldn’ t seem so bad for us to break into an empty
house. But you are a solicitor and the Incorporated Law Society
might tell you that you should have known better .” I demurred as to
my not sharing any danger even of odium, but he went on: “Besides,
it will attract less attention if there are not too many of us. My title
will make it all right with the locksmith, and with any policeman that
may come  along. You had better go with Jack and the Professor and
stay in the Green Park, somewhere in sight of the house; and when
you see the door opened and the smith  has gone away , do you all
come across. We shall be on the looko ut for you, and shall let you
in.”
“The advice is good!” said Van Helsi ng, so we said no more. Godalming and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another . At the corner of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled
into the Green Park. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so
much of our hope was centred, loomin g up grim and silent in its
deserted condition amongst its more lively and spruce-looking
neighbours. We sat down on a bench within good view , and began to
smoke cigars so as to attract as little attention as possible. The
minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we waited for the coming
of the others. At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely
fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box
descended a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of
tools. Morris paid the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away . Together the two ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed
out what he wanted  done. The workman took off his coat leisurely
and hung it on one of the spikes of the rail, saying something to a
policeman who just then sauntered along. The policeman nodded
acquiescence, and the man kneeling down placed his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out a selection of tools which he
produced to lay beside him in orderly fashion. Then he stood up,
looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and turning to his employers,
made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and the man lifted a
good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he began to probe
the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling about for a bit
he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the door opened under
a slight push from him, and he and the two others entered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously , but Van Helsing’ s went
cold altogether . We waited patiently as we saw the workman come
out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly open,
steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock. This he
finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and gave
him some thing. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 224/291coat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole
transaction. When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and
knocked at the door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris,
beside whom stood Lord Godalming lighting a cigar . “The place smells so vilely ,” said the latter as we came in. It did
indeed smell vilely—like the old chap el at Carfax—and with our
previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using
the place pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping
together in case of attack; for we knew  we had a strong and wily
enemy to deal with,  and as yet we did not know whether the Count
might not be in the house. In the dining-room, which lay at the back
of the hall, we found eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of
the nine, which we sought! Our work was not over, and would never
be until we should have found the missing box. First we opened the
shutters of the window which looked out across a narrow stone-
flagged yard at the blank face of a stable, pointed to look like the
front of a miniature house. There were no windows in it, so we were
not afraid  of being over-looked. We did not lose any time in
examining the chests. With the tools which we had brought with us
we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had treated
those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the Count was
not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for any of his
effects. After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to
attic, we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any
effects which might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to
minutely examine them. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the
great dining-room table. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly
house in a great bundle; deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile
End and Bermondsey; note-paper , enve lopes, and pens and ink. All
were cove red up in thin wrapping paper  to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and
basin—the latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if
with blood. Last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes,
probably those belonging to the other houses. When we had
examined this last find, Lord Godalmin g and Quincey Morris taking
accurate notes of the various addresses of the houses in the East and
the South,  took with them the keys in a great bunch, and set out to
destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us are, with what
patience we can, waiting their return—or the coming of the Count.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

DR. SEWARD’S DIARY
3 October .—The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting
for the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor
tried to keep our minds active by using them all the time. I could see
his beneficent purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time
to time at Harker . The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is
appalling to see. Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with
strong, youthful face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-
day he is a drawn, haggard old man, whose white hair matches well
with the hollow burning eyes and grief- written lines of his face. His
energy is still intact;  in fact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be
his salvation, for, if all go well, it will tide him over the despairing
period; he will then, in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of
life. Poor fellow , I thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his
——! The Professor knows this well enough, and is doing his best to
keep his mind active. What he has been saying was, under the
circumstances, of absorbing interest. So well as I can remember , here
it is:—
“I have studied, over and over again since they came into my
hands, all the papers relating to this monster; and the more I have
studied, the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All
through there are signs of his advance; not only of his power , but of
his knowledge of it. As I learned from the researches of my friend
Arminus of Buda-Pesth, he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier , statesman, and alchemist—w hich latter was the highest
development of the science-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty
brain, a learning beyond compare, and a heart that knew no fear and
no remorse. He dared even to attend the Scholomance, and there was
no branch  of knowledge of his time that he did not essay . Well, in
him the brain powers survived the physical death; though it would
seem that memory was not all complet e. In some faculties of mind
he has been, and is, only a child; but he is growing, and some things
that were childish at the first are now of man’ s stature. He is
experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not been that we have
crossed his path he would be yet—he may be yet if we fail—the
father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must lead
through Death, not Life.”
Harker groaned and said, “And this is all arrayed against my
darling! But how is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us
to defeat him!”
“He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power , slowly
but surely ; that big child-brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, as
yet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain
things he would long ago have been beyond our power . However , he
means to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can
afford to wait and to go slow . Festina lente  may well be his motto.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 226/291“I fail to understand ,” said Harker wear ily. “Oh, do be more plain
to me! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.”
The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:
—
“Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this
monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally . How he
has been making use of the zoöphagous patient to effect his entry
into friend  John’ s home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards
he can come when and how he will, must at the first make entry only
when asked thereto by an inmate. But these are not his most
important experimen ts.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Do we not see how at the first all these so
great boxe s were moved by others. He knew not then but that must
be so. But all the time that so great child-brain of his was growing,
and he began to consider whether he might not himself move the
box. So he began to help; and then, when he found that this be all-
right, he try to move them all alone. And so he progress, and he
scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where they are
hidden. He may have intend to bury them  deep in the ground. So that
he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his
form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his
hiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to
him just too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for
him; and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place
where he can move and hide.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I delayed this morning that so we
might be sure. Is there not more at stake for us than for him? Then
why we not be even more careful than him? By my clock it is one
hour and already , if all be well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on
their way to us. To-day is our day, and we must go sure, if slow, and
lose no chance.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"See! there are five of us when those absent ones
return.”
Whilst he was speaking we were startl ed by a knock at the hall
door, the double postman’ s knock of the telegraph boy. We all moved
out to the hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his
hand to us to keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. The
boy handed in a despatch. The Professor closed the door again, and,
after looking at the direction, opened it and read aloud. “Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax
hurriedly and hastened towards the South. He seems to be going the
round and may want to see you: Mina.”
There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker ’s voice:—
“Now , God be thank ed, we shall soon meet!” Van Helsing turned
to him quickly and said:—
“God will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not
rejoice as yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our
undoings.”
“I care for nothing now,” he answered hotly , “except to wipe out
this brute from the face of creation. I would sell my soul to do it!”
“Oh, hush, hush, my child!” said Van Helsing. “God does not
purchase souls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase,
does not keep faith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your
pain and your devo tion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how
her pain would be doubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 227/291fear any of us, we are all devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see
the end. The time is coming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to
the powers of man,  and till sunset he may not change. It will take
him time to arrive here—see, it is twenty minutes past one—and
there are yet some times before he can hither come, be he never so
quick. What we must hope for is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey
arrive first.”
About half an hour after we had receive d Mrs. Harker ’s telegram,
there came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an
ordinary knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen,
but it made the Professor ’s heart and mine beat loudly . We looked at
each other , and together moved out into the hall; we each held ready
to use our various armaments—the spiritual in the left hand, the
mortal in the right. Van Helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding
the door half open, stood back, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts must have shown upon our faces when on
the step, close to the door, we saw Lord Godalming and Quincey
Morris. They came quickly in and close d the door behind them, the
former saying, as they moved along the hall:—
“It is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and we
destroyed them all!”
“Destroyed?” asked the Professor . “For him!” We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:—
“There’ s nothing to do but to wait here. If, however , he doesn’ t
turn up by five o’clock, we must start off; for it won’ t do to leave
Mrs. Harker alone after sunset.”
“He will be here before long now,” said Van Helsing, who had
been consulting his pocket-book. “Nota bene , in Madam’ s telegram
he went south from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and
he could only do so at slack of tide, which should be something
before one o’clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is
as yet only suspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place
where he would suspect interference least. You must have been at
Bermondsey only a short time before him. That he is not here already
shows that he went to Mile End next. This took him some time; for
he would then have to be carried over the river in some way. Believe
me, my friends, we shall not have long to wait now. We should have
ready some plan of attack, so that we may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Have all your arms! Be ready!” He held
up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could hear a key softly
inserted in the lock of the hall door . I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a
dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and
adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had
always been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I
had been accustom ed to obey him implicitly . Now , the old habit
seemed to be renewed instinctively . With a swift glance around the
room, he at once laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a
word, with a gestu re, placed us each in position. Van Helsing,
Harker , and I were just behind the door, so that when it was opened
the Profes sor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the
incomer and the door. Godalming behin d and Quincey in front stood6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 228/291just out of sight ready to move in front of the window . We waited in
a suspense  that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The
slow, careful steps came along the hall; the Count was evidently
prepared for some surprise—at least he feared it. Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a
way past us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There
was something so panther -like in the movement—something so
unhuman, that it seemed to sober us all from the shock of his
coming. The first to act was Harker , who, with a quick movement,
threw himself befor e the door leading into the room in the front of
the house. As the Count saw us, a horrible sort of snarl passed over
his face, showing the eye-teeth long and pointed; but the evil smile
as quickly passed into a cold stare  of lion-like disdain. His
expression again changed as, with a single impulse, we all advanced
upon him. It was a pity that we had not some better organised plan of
attack, for even at the moment I wondered what we were to do. I did
not myself know whether our letha l weapons would avail us
anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter , for he had ready
his great Kukri knife and made a fierce  and sudden cut at him. The
blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the
Count’ s leap back saved him. A second  less and the trenchant blade
had shorne  through his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of
his coat, making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a
stream of gold fell out. The expression  of the Count’ s face was so
hellish, that for a moment I feared for Harker , though I saw him
throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I
moved forward with a protective impul se, holding the Crucifix and
Wafer in my left hand. I felt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it
was witho ut surprise that I saw the monster cower back before a
similar movement made spontaneously by each one of us. It would
be impossible to describe the expre ssion of hate and baffled
malignity—of anger and hellish rage—which came over the Count’ s
face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast of his
burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid
skin like a palpitatin g wound. The next instant, with a sinuous dive
he swept under Hark er’s arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping a
handful of the money from the floor , dashed across the room, threw
himself at the window . Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass,
he tumble d into the flagged area below . Through the sound of the
shivering glass I could hear the “ting” of the gold, as some of the
sovereigns fell on the flagging. We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He,
rushing up the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the
stable door . There he turned and spoke to us:—
“You think to baffle me, you—with your pale faces all in a row,
like sheep  in a butcher ’s. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You think you have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge is just begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on
my side. Your girls that you all love are mine already; and through
them you and others shall yet be mine—my creatures, to do my
bidding and to be my jackals when I want to feed. Bah!” With a
contemptuous sneer , he passed quickly through the door, and we
heard the rusty bolt creak as he fastened it behind him. A door6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 229/291beyond opened and shut. The first of us to speak was the Professor ,
as, realising the difficulty of following him through the stable, we
moved toward the hall. “We have learnt something—much! Notwithstanding his brave
words, he fears us; he fear time, he fear want! For if not, why he
hurry so? His very tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take
that mone y? You follow quick.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"You are hunters of wild beast, and
understand it so. For me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use
to him, if so that he return.” As he spoke he put the money remaining
into his pocket; took the title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left
them, and swept the remaining things into the open fireplace, where
he set fire to them with a match. Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker
had lowered himself from the window to follow the Count. He had,
however , bolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it
open there was no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to make
inquiry at the back of the house; but the mews was deserted and no
one had seen him depart. It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We
had to recognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed
with the Professor when he said:—
“Let us go back to Madam Mina—poor , poor dear Madam Mina. All we can do just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect
her. But we need not despair . There is but one more earth-box, and
we must try to find it; when that is done all may yet be well.” I could
see that he spoke as bravely as he could to comfort Harker . The poor
fellow was quite broken down; now and again he gave a low groan
which he could not suppress—he was thinking of his wife. With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did
honour to her bravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces,
her own became as pale as death: for a second or two her eyes were
closed as if she were in secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:—
“I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!” As she
spoke, she took her husband’ s grey head in her hands and kissed it
—“Lay your poor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protect us if He so will it in His good intent.” The poor
fellow groaned. There was no place for words in his sublime misery . We had a sort of perfunctory supper  together , and I think it
cheered us all up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of
food to hungry people—for none of us had eaten anything since
breakfast—or the sense of companionsh ip may have helped us; but
anyhow we were all less miserable, and saw the morrow as not
altogether without hope. True to our promise, we told Mrs. Harker
everything which had passed; and althou gh she grew snowy white at
times when danger had seemed to threaten her husband, and red at
others when his devotion to her was manifested, she listened bravely
and with calmness. When we came to the part where Harker had
rushed at the Count  so recklessly , she clung to her husband’ s arm,
and held it tight as though her clinging could protect him from any
harm that might come. She said nothin g, however , till the narration
was all done, and matters had been brought right up to the present6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 230/291time. Then without letting go her husband’ s hand she stood up
amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the scene; of
that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty of her
youth and animation , with the red scar on her forehead, of which she
was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our teeth—
remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against
our grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and
we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness
and purity and faith, was outcast from God. “Jonathan,” she said, and the word soun ded like music on her lips
it was so full of love and tenderness, “Jonathan dear, and you all my
true, true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all
this dread ful time. I know that you must fight—that you must
destroy even as you destroyed the false  Lucy so that the true Lucy
might live hereafter; but it is not a work  of hate. That poor soul who
has wrought all this misery is the saddest case of all. Just think what
will be his joy when he, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his
better part may have spiritual immortality . You must be pitiful to
him, too, though it may not hold your hands from his destruction.”
As she spoke I could see her husband ’s face darken and draw
together , as though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to
its core. Instinctively the clasp on his wife’ s hand grew closer , till his
knuckles looked white. She did not flinch from the pain which I
knew she must have suffered, but looke d at him with eyes that were
more appealing than ever. As she stopp ed speaking he leaped to his
feet, almost tearing his hand from hers as he spoke:—
“May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy
that earthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could
send his soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!”
“Oh, hush! oh, hush !","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"in the name of the good God. Don’ t say such
things, Jonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and
horror . Just think, my dear—I have been thinking all this long, long
day of it—that ... perhaps ...","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"some day ... I, too, may need such pity;
and that some other like you—and with equal cause for anger—may
deny it to me! Oh, my husband! my husband, indeed I would have
spared you such a thought had there been another way; but I pray
that God may not have treasured your wild words, except as the
heart-broken wail of a very loving and sorely stricken man. Oh, God,
let these poor white hairs go in evidence of what he has suffered,
who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom so many sorrows
have come.”
We men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and
we wept openly . She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had
prevailed. Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and
putting his arms round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van
Helsing beckoned to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two
loving hearts alone with their God. Before they retired the Professor fixed  up the room against any
coming of the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest
in peace. She tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for
her husband’ s sake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle;
and was, I think and believe, not withou t its reward. Van Helsing had
placed at hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 231/291any emer gency . When they had retired,  Quincey , Godalming, and I
arranged that we should sit up, dividin g the night between us, and
watch over the safety of the poor stricken lady. The first watch falls
to Quincey , so the rest of us shall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in, for his is the second watch. Now
that my work is done I, too, shall go to bed. Jonathan Harker ’s Journal. 3-4 October , close to midnight. —I thought yesterday would never
end. There  was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind
belief that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any
change must now be for the better . Before we parted, we discussed
what our next step was to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we
knew was that one earth-box remained, and that the Count alone
knew where it was. If he chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for
years; and in the meantime!—the thought is too horrible, I dare not
think of it even now. This I know: that if ever there was a woman
who was all perfection, that one is my poor wronged darling. I love
her a thousand times  more for her sweet pity of last night, a pity that
made my own hate of the monster seem  despicable. Surely God will
not permit the world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all drifting reefwards now, and faith is our
only anchor . Thank God! Mina is sleeping, and sleeping without
dreams. I fear what her dreams might be like, with such terrible
memories to ground them in. She has not been so calm, within my
seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there came over her face a
repose which was like spring after the blasts of March. I thought at
the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her face, but
somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepy
myself, though I am weary—weary to death. However , I must try to
sleep; for there is to-morrow to think of, and there is no rest for me
until.... Later .—I must have fallen  asleep, for I was awaked by Mina, who
was sitting  up in bed, with a startled look on her face. I could see
easily , for we did not leave the room in darkness; she had placed a
warning hand over my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear:—
“Hush! there is someone in the corridor!” I got up softly , and
crossing the room, gently opened the door . Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake. He raised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me:—
“Hush! go back to bed; it is all right. One of us will be here all
night. We don’ t mean to take any chances!”
His look and gestur e forbade discussion, so I came back and told
Mina. She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her
poor, pale face as she put her arms round me and said softly:—
“Oh, thank God for good brave men!” With a sigh she sank back
again to sleep. I write this now as I am not sleepy , though I must try
again. 4 October , morning. —Once again during the night I was wakened
by Mina. This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 232/291coming dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the
gas flame was like a speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me
hurriedly:—
“Go, call the Professor .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I want to see him at once.”
“Why?” I asked. “I have an idea. I suppose it must have come in the night, and
matured without my knowing it. He must hypnotise me before the
dawn, and then I shall be able to speak. Go quick, dearest; the time is
getting close.” I went to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on the
mattress, and, seeing me, he sprang to his feet. “Is anything wrong?” he asked, in alarm. “No,” I replied; “but Mina wants to see Dr . Van Helsing at once.”
“I will go,” he said, and hurried into the Professor ’s room. In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his
dressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at the door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina
smile—a positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his
hands as he said:—
“Oh, my dear Mada m Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend
Jonathan, we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us
to-day!” Then turnin g to her, he said, cheerfully: “And what am I do
for you? For at this hour you do not want me for nothings.”
“I want you to hypnotise me!” she said. “Do it before the dawn,
for I feel that then I can speak, and speak freely . Be quick, for the
time is short!” Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed. Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of
her, from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Mina gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own
heart beat like a trip hammer , for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle
heaving of her bosom could one know that she was alive. The
Professor made a few more passes and then stopped, and I could see
that his forehead was covered with great beads of perspiration. Mina
opened her eyes; but she did not seem the same woman. There was a
far-away look in her eyes, and her voice had a sad dreaminess which
was new to me. Raising his hand to impose silence, the Professor
motioned to me to bring the others in. They came on tip-toe, closing
the door behind them, and stood at the foot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. The stillness was broken by Van
Helsing’ s voice speaking in a low level  tone which would not break
the current of her thoughts:—
“Where are you?” The answer came in a neutral way:—
“I do not know . Sleep has no place it can call its own.” For several
minutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood
staring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The
room was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina’ s face,
Dr. Van Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the
day seemed just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light
seemed to diffuse itself through the room. On the instant the
Professor spoke again:—6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 233/291“Where are you now?” The answer came dreamily , but with
intention; it were as though she were interpreting something. I have
heard her use the same tone when reading her shorthand notes.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"“I do not know . It is all strange to me!”
“What do you see?”
“I can see nothing; it is all dark.”
“What do you hear? ” I could detect the strain in the Professor ’s
patient voice. “The lapping of water . It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I can
hear them on the outside.”
“Then you are on a ship?” We all looked at each other , trying to
glean something each from the other . We were afraid to think. The
answer came quick:—
“Oh, yes!”
“What else do you hear?”
“The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is
the creaki ng of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the
capstan falls into the rachet.”
“What are you doing?”
“I am still—oh, so still. It is like death !” The voice faded away
into a deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again. By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of
day. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina’ s shoulders, and laid
her head down softly on her pillow . She lay like a sleeping child for a
few moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in
wonder to see us all around her. “Have I been talking in my sleep?”
was all she said. She seemed, however , to know the situation without
telling, though she was eager to know what she had told. The
Professor repeated the conversation, and she said:—
“Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!”
Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the
Professor ’s calm voice called them back:—
“Stay , my friends. That ship, wherev er it was, was weighing
anchor whilst she spoke. There are many ships weighing anchor at
the moment in your so great Port of London. Which of them is it that
you seek?","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"God be thanked that we have once again a clue, though
whither it may lead us we know not. We have been blind somewhat;
blind after the manner of men, since when we can look back we see
what we might have  seen looking forwa rd if we had been able to see
what we might have  seen! Alas, but that sentence is a puddle; is it
not? We can know now what was in the Count’ s mind, when he seize
that money , though Jonathan’ s so fierce  knife put him in the danger
that even he dread. He meant escape. Hear me, ESCAPE! He saw
that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of men following like
dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. He have take his
last earth-box on board a ship, and he leave the land. He think to
escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur would say
when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and
we must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a
little while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are
waters between us which he do not want to pass, and which he could6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

only at full or slack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to
sunset is to us. Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which
we all need, and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the
same land with us.” Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:—
“But why need we seek him further , when he is gone away from
us?” He took her hand and patted it as he replied:—
“Ask me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer
all questions.” He would say no more, and we separated to dress. After breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked at her
gravely for a minute and then said sorrowfully:—
“Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must
we find him even if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!” She
grew paler as she asked faintly:—
“Why?”
“Because,” he answered solemnly , “he can live for centuries, and
you are but mortal woman. Time is now to be dreaded—since once
he put that mark upon your throat.”
I was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

DR. SEWARD’S PHONOGRAPH DIARY, SPOKEN BY VAN
HELSING
THIS to Jonathan Harker . You are to stay with your dear Madam Mina. We shall go to make
our search—if I can call it so, for it is not search but knowing, and
we seek confirmation only. But do you stay and take care of her to-
day. This is your best and most holiest office. This day nothing can
find him here. Let me tell you that so you will know what we four
know already, for I have tell them. He, our enemy , have gone away;
he have gone back to his Castle in Transylvania. I know it so well, as
if a great hand of fire wrote it on the wall. He have prepare for this in
some way, and that last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. For
this he took the money; for this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him
before the sun go down. It was his last hope, save that he might hide
in the tomb that he think poor Miss Lucy , being as he thought like
him, keep open to him. But there was not of time. When that fail he
make straight for his last resource—his last earth-work I might say
did I wish double entente . He is clever, oh, so clever! he know that
his game here was finish; and so he decide he go back home. He find
ship going by the route he came, and he go in it. We go off now to
find what ship, and whither bound; when we have discover that, we
come back  and tell you all. Then we will comfort you and poor dear
Madam Mina with new hope. For it will be hope when you think it
over: that all is not lost. This very creature that we pursue, he take
hundreds of years to get so far as Londo n; and yet in one day, when
we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. He is finite,
though he is powerfu l to do much harm and suffers not as we do. But
we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong
together . Take heart afresh, dear husb and of Madam Mina. This
battle is but begun, and in the end we shall win—so sure as that God
sits on high to watch over His children. Therefore be of much
comfort till we return.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

certainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort;
and comfort is strength to her. For my own part, now that his horrible
danger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible to
believe in it. Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula
seem like a long-for gotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in the

is comforting. Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of
ultimate good. It may be! I shall try to think as she does. We have

Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris,
Jonathan Harker , Mina Harker .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Dr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to
discover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his
escape:—
“As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure
that he must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black
Sea, since by that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before
us. Omne ignotum pro magnifico ; and so with heavy  hearts we start
to find what ships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in
sailing ship, since Madam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so
important as to go in your list of the shipping in the Times, and so we
go, by suggestion of Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd’ s, where are
note of all ships that sail, however so small. There we find that only
one Black-Sea-boun d ship go out with the tide. She is the Czarina
Catherine , and she sail from Doolittle’ s Wharf for Varna, and thence
on to other parts and up the Danube. ‘Soh!’  said I, ‘this is the ship
whereon is the Count.’  So off we go to Doolittle’ s Wharf, and there
we find a man in an office of wood so small that the man look bigger
than the office. From him we inquire of the goings of the Czarina
Catherine . He swear  much, and he red face and loud of voice, but he
good fellow all the same; and when Quincey give him something
from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and put it in a so small
bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he still better fellow and
humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask many men who are
rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they have been no
more thirsty . They say much of blood  and bloom, and of others
which I comprehen d not, though I guess what they mean; but
nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know . “They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about
five o’cloc k comes a man so hurry . A tall man, thin and pale, with
high nose and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That
he be all in black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not
him or the time. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry
as to what  ship sails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him
to the office and then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but
halt at shore end of gang-plank, and ask that the captain come to
him. The captain come, when told that he will be pay well; and
though he swear much at the first he agree to term. Then the thin
man go and some one tell him where horse and cart can be hired. He
go there and soon he come again, himself driving cart on which a6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 237/291great box; this he himself lift down, though it take several to put it on
truck for the ship. He give much talk to captain as to how and where
his box is to be place; but the captain like it not and swear at him in
many tongues, and tell him that if he like he can come and see where
it shall be. But he say ‘no’; that he come not yet, for that he have
much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be
quick—with blood—for that his ship will leave the place—of blood
—before the turn of the tide—with blood. Then the thin man smile
and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but he will be
surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again, polyglot,
and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he will
so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell him
that he doesn’ t want  no Frenchmen—with bloom upon them and also
with blood—in his ship—with blood on her also. And so, after
asking where there might be close at hand a ship where he might
purchase ship forms, he departed. “No one knew where he went ‘or bloomin’  well cared,’  as they
said, for they had something else to think of—well with blood again;
for it soon became apparent to all that the Czarina Catherine  would
not sail as was expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the
river, and it grew , and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship
and all around her. The captain swore polyglot—very polyglot—
polyglot with bloom and blood; but he could do nothing. The water
rose and rose; and he began to fear that he would lose the tide
altogether . He was in no friendly mood, when just at full tide, the
thin man came up the gang-plank again and asked to see where his
box had been stowed . Then the captain replied that he wished that he
and his box—old and with much bloom and blood—were in hell. But
the thin man did not be offend, and went down with the mate and
saw where  it was place, and came up and stood awhile on deck in
fog. He must have come off by himself,  for none notice him. Indeed
they thoug ht not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away , and all
was clear again. My friends of the thirst  and the language that was of
bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain’ s swears
exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of
picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on
movement up and down on the river that hour, he found that few of
them had seen any of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However , the ship went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by
morning far down the river mouth. She was by then, when they told
us, well out to sea. “And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a
time, for our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on
his way to the Danube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never
so quick; and when we start we go on land more quick, and we meet
him there. Our best hope is to come on him when in the box between
sunrise and sunset; for then he can make no struggle, and we may
deal with him as we should. There are days for us, in which we can
make ready our plan. We know all about where he go; for we have
seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us invoices and all
papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in Varna, and to
be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present his
credentials; and so our merchant frien d will have done his part.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 238/291When he ask if there  be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and
have inquiry made at Varna, we say ‘no’; for what is to be done is
not for police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in
our own way .”
When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were
certain that the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied:
“We have  the best proof of that: your own evidence, when in the
hypnotic trance this morning.” I asked him again if it were really
necessary that they should pursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan
leaving me, and I know that he would surely go if the others went. He answe red in growing passion, at first quietly . As he went on,
however , he grew more angry and more forceful, till in the end we
could not but see wherein was at least some of that personal
dominance which made him so long a master amongst men:—
“Yes, it is necessary—necessary—necessary! For your sake in the
first, and then for the sake of humanity . This monster has done much
harm alrea dy, in the narrow scope wher e he find himself, and in the
short time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small
measure in darkness and not knowing. All this have I told these
others; you, my dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of
my friend John, or in that of your husband. I have told them how the
measure of leaving his own barren land—barren of peoples—and
coming to a new land where life of man teems till they are like the
multitude of standing corn, was the work of centuries. Were another
of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do what he has done, perhaps not
all the centuries of the world that have been, or that will be, could aid
him. With this one, all the forces of nature that are occult and deep
and strong must have worked together in some wondrous way. The
very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for all these
centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither . There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out
waters of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify . Doubtless, there is something magnetic or electric in some of these
combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in strange
way; and in himself were from the first some great qualities. In a
hard and warlike time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve,
more subtle brain, more braver heart, than any man. In him some
vital princ iple have in strange way found their utmost; and as his
body keep strong and grow and thrive, so his brain grow too. All this
without that diabolic aid which is surel y to him; for it have to yield
to the powers that come from, and are, symbolic of good. And now
this is what he is to us. He have infect you—oh, forgive me, my dear,
that I must say such; but it is for good of you that I speak. He infect
you in such wise, that even if he do no more, you have only to live—
to live in your own old, sweet way; and so in time, death, which is of
man’ s common lot and with God’ s sanction, shall make you like to
him. This must not be!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"We have sworn together that it must not. Thus
are we ministers of God’ s own wish: that the world, and men for
whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters, whose very
existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one
soul already , and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem
more. Like them we shall travel towards  the sunrise; and like them, if
we fall, we fall in good cause.” He paused and I said:—6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 239/291“But will not the Count take his rebuf f wisely? Since he has been
driven from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village
from which he has been hunted?”
“Aha!” he said, “your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall
adopt him. Your man-eater , as they of India call the tiger who has
once tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but
prowl unceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is
a tiger, too, a man-ea ter, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself
he is not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he go
over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he
be beaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and
again. Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain
that was to him he have long since conc eive the idea of coming to a
great city. What does he do? He find out the place of all the world
most of promise for him. Then he deliberately set himself down to
prepare for the task. He find in patience just how is his strength, and
what are his powers. He study new tongues. He learn new social life;
new environment of old ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the
science, the habit of a new land and a new people who have come to
be since he was. His glimpse that he have had, whet his appetite only
and enkeen his desir e. Nay, it help him to grow as to his brain; for it
all prove to him how right he was at the first in his surmises. He have
done this alone; all alone! from a ruin tomb in a forgotten land. What
more may he not do when the greater world of thought is open to
him. He that can smile at death, as we know him; who can flourish in
the midst of diseases that kill off whole peoples. Oh, if such an one
was to come from God, and not the Devil, what a force for good
might he not be in this old world of ours. But we are pledged to set
the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our efforts all in
secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not even what
they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest strength. It
would be at once his sheath and his armour , and his weapons to
destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls
for the safety of one we love—for the good of mankind, and for the
honour and glory of God.”
After a general discussion it was determined that for to-night
nothing be definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts,
and try to think out the proper conclusions. To-morrow , at breakfast,
we are to meet again, and, after making our conclusions known to
one another , we shall decide on some definite cause of action.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

still unclean. Dr.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Sewar d’s Diary . 5 October.—We all rose early , and I think that sleep did much for
each and all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was more
general cheerfulness  than any of us had ever expected to experience
again.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 240/291It is really wonder ful how much resilience there is in human
nature. Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any
way—even by death—and we fly back to first principles of hope and
enjoyment. More than once as we sat around the table, my eyes
opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a
dream. It was only when I caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker ’s forehead that I was brought back to reality . Even now, when
I am gravely revolv ing the matter , it is almost impossible to realise
that the cause of all our trouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker
seems to lose sight of her trouble for whole spells; it is only now and
again, when something recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her
terrible scar. We are to meet here in my study in half an hour and
decide on our course of action. I see only one immediate difficulty , I
know it by instinct rather than reason:  we shall all have to speak
frankly; and yet I fear that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker ’s tongue is tied. I know  that she forms conclusions of her
own, and from all that has been I can guess how brilliant and how
true they must be; but she will not, or cannot, give them utterance. I
have ment ioned this to Van Helsing, and he and I are to talk it over
when we are alone.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I suppose it is some  of that horrid poison which
has got into her veins beginning to work. The Count had his own
purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called “the Vampire’ s
baptism of blood.” Well, there may be a poison that distils itself out
of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is a
mystery we should not wonder at anythi ng! One thing I know: that if
my instinc t be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker ’s silences, then there
is a terrible difficulty—an unknown danger—in the work before us. The same power that compels her silen ce may compel her speech. I
dare not think further; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a
noble woman! Van Helsin g is coming to my study a little before the others. I shall
try to open the subject with him. Later .—When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of
things. I could see that he had something on his mind which he
wanted to say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating about the bush a little, he said suddenly:—
“Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone,
just at the first at any rate. Later , we may have to take the others into
our confidence”; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:—
“Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing.” A cold
shiver ran through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van
Helsing continued:—
“With the sad expe rience of Miss Lucy , we must this time be
warned before things go too far. Our task is now in reality more
difficult than ever, and this new troub le makes every hour of the
direst importance. I can see the characteristics of the vampire coming
in her face. It is now but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we
have eyes to notice without to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper ,
and at times her eyes are more hard. But these are not all, there is to
her the silence now often; as so it was with Miss Lucy . She did not
speak, even when she wrote that which she wished to be known later.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Now my fear is this. If it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 241/291what the Count see and hear, is it not more true that he who have
hypnotise her first, and who have drink  of her very blood and make
her drink of his, should, if he will, compel her mind to disclose to
him that which she know?” I nodded acquiescence; he went on:—
“Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her
ignorant of our intent, and so she cannot  tell what she know not. This
is a painfu l task!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but
it must be. When to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason
which we will not to speak she must not more be of our council, but
be simply guarded by us.” He wiped his forehead, which had broken
out in profuse persp iration at the though t of the pain which he might
have to inflict upon the poor soul alread y so tortured. I knew that it
would be some sort of comfort to him if I told him that I also had
come to the same conclusion; for at any rate it would take away the
pain of doubt. I told him, and the ef fect was as I expected. It is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing
has gone away to prepare for the meetin g, and his painful part of it. I
really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone. Later .—At the very outse t of our meeting a great personal relief
was experienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had
sent a message by her husband to say that she would not join us at
present, as she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our
movements without her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and
I looked at each other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed
relieved. For my own part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the
danger herself, it was much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we agreed, by a questioning look and
answer , with finger on lip, to preserve silence in our suspicions, until
we should  have been able to confer alone again.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"We went at once
into our Plan of Campaign. Van Helsing roughly put the facts before
us first:—
“The Czarina Catherine  left the Thames yesterday morning. It
will take her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three
weeks to reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place
in three days. Now , if we allow for two days less for the ship’ s
voyage, owing to such weather influences as we know that the Count
can bring to bear; and if we allow a whole day and night for any
delays which may occur to us, then we have a margin of nearly two
weeks. Thus, in order to be quite safe, we must leave here on 17th at
latest. Then we shall at any rate be in Varna a day before the ship
arrives, and able to make such preparations as may be necessary . Of
course we shall all go armed—armed against evil things, spiritual as
well as physical.” Here Quincey Morris added:—
“I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country , and it
may be that he shall get there before us. I propose that we add
Winchesters to our armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester
when there  is any trouble of that sort around. Do you remember , Art,
when we had the pack after us at Tobolsk? What wouldn’ t we have
given then for a repeater apiece!”
“Good!” said Van Helsing, “Winchesters it shall be. Quincey’ s
head is level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 242/291be more dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In
the meantime we can do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not
familiar to any of us, why not go there more soon?","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"It is as long to
wait here as there. To-night and to-morrow we can get ready , and
then, if all be well, we four can set out on our journey .”
“We four?” said Harker interrogatively , looking from one to
another of us. “Of course!” answered the Professor quickly , “you must remain to
take care of your so sweet wife!” Hark er was silent for awhile and
then said in a hollow voice:—
“Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with
Mina.” I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him
not to disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at
him signif icantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his
lips and turned away . Jonathan Harker ’s Journal. 5 October , afternoon. —For some time after our meeting this
morning I could not think. The new phases of things leave my mind
in a state of wonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina’ s
determination not to take any part in the discussion set me thinking;
and as I could not argue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am
as far as ever from a solution now. The way the others received it,
too, puzzle d me; the last time we talked of the subject we agreed that
there was to be no more concealment of anything amongst us. Mina
is sleeping now, calmly and sweetly like a little child. Her lips are
curved and her face beams with happiness. Thank God, there are
such moments still for her . Later .—How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina’ s happy sleep,
and came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As the evening drew  on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun
sinking lower , the silence of the room grew more and more solemn
to me. All at once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly ,
said:—
“Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of
honour . A promise made to me, but made holily in God’ s hearing,
and not to be broke n though I should go down on my knees and
implore you with bitter tears. Quick, you must make it to me at
once.”
“Mina,” I said, “a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may
have no right to make it.”
“But, dear one,” she said, with such spiritual intensity that her
eyes were like pole stars, “it is I who wish it; and it is not for myself. You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you
may do as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are
absolved from the promise.”
“I promise!” I said, and for a moment she looked supremely
happy; though to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar
on her forehead. She said:—
“Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans
formed for the campaign against the Count. Not by word, or6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 243/291inference, or implication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!”
and she solemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest,
and said solemnly:—
“I promise!” and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had
been shut between us.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Later , midnight. —Mina has been bright and cheerful all the
evening. So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if
infected somewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if
the pall of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We
all retired early . Mina is now sleepin g like a little child; it is a
wonderful thing that her faculty of sleep  remains to her in the midst
of her terrible trouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can
forget her care. Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did
to-night. I shall try it. Oh!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"for a dreamless sleep. 6 October , morning. —Another surprise. Mina woke me early,
about the same time as yesterday , and asked me to bring Dr. Van
Helsing. I thought that it was another occasion for hypnotism, and
without question went for the Professor . He had evidently expected
some such call, for I found him dresse d in his room. His door was
ajar, so that he could hear the opening of the door of our room. He
came at once; as he passed into the room , he asked Mina if the others
might come, too. “No,” she said quite simply , “it will not be necessary . You can tell
them just as well. I must go with you on your journey .”
Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment’ s pause
he asked:—
“But why?”
“You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be
safer , too.”
“But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our
solemnest duty. We go into danger , to which you are, or may be,
more liable than any of us from—from circumstances—things that
have been.” He paused, embarrassed. As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:
—
“I know . That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun
is coming up; I may not be able again. I know that when the Count
wills me I must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I
must come by wile; by any device to hoodwink—even Jonathan.”
God saw the look that she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be
indeed a Recording Angel that look is noted to her everlasting
honour . I could only clasp her hand.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I could not speak; my emotion
was too great for even the relief of tears. She went on:—
“You men are brave  and strong. You are strong in your numbers,
for you can defy that which would break down the human endurance
of one who had to guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since
you can hypnotise me and so learn that which even I myself do not
know .” Dr . Van Helsing said very gravely:—6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 244/291“Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us
come; and together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve.”
When he had spoken, Mina’ s long spell of silence made me look at
her. She had fallen back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake
when I had pulled up the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded
the room. Van Helsi ng motioned to me to come with him quietly . We
went to his room, and within a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward,
and Mr. Morris were  with us also. He told them what Mina had said,
and went on:—
“In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal
with a new factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her
an agony to tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and
we are warned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna
we must be ready to act the instant when that ship arrives.”
“What shall we do exactly?” asked Mr. Morris laconically . The
Professor paused before replying:—
“We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have
identified the box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This
we shall fasten, for when it is there none can emer ge; so at least says
the superstition. And to superstition must we trust at the first; it was
man’ s faith in the early , and it have its root in faith still. Then, when
we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we
shall open the box, and—and all will be well.”
“I shall not wait for any opportunity ,” said Morris. “When I see
the box I shall open  it and destroy the monster , though there were a
thousand men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next
moment!” I grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a
piece of steel. I think he understood my look; I hope he did. “Good boy,” said Dr. Van Helsing. “Brave boy. Quincey is all
man. God bless him for it. My child, believe me none of us shall lag
behind or pause from any fear. I do but say what we may do—what
we must do. But, indeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do. There are so many things which may happen, and their ways and
their ends are so various that until the moment we may not say. We
shall all be armed, in all ways; and when the time for the end has
come, our effort shall not be lack. Now let us to-day put all our
affairs in order . Let all things which touch on others dear to us, and
who on us depend,  be complete; for none of us can tell what, or
when, or how, the end may be. As for me, my own affairs are
regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go make
arrangements for the travel. I shall have all tickets and so forth for
our journey .”
There was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I shall now
settle up all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may
come.... Later .—It is all done; my will is made, and all complete. Mina if
she survive is my sole heir. If it should not be so, then the others who
have been so good to us shall have remainder . It is now drawing towards the sunset; Mina’ s uneasiness calls my
attention to it. I am sure that there is something on her mind which
the time of exact sunset will reveal. These occasions are becoming6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

some new danger— some new pain, which, however , may in God’ s
will be means to a good end. I write all these things in the diary since

DR. SEWARD’S DIARY
11 October , Evening. —Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this,
as he says he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record
kept. I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see
Mrs. Harker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come
to understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar
freedom; when her old self can be manifest without any controlling
force subduing or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood
or conditio n begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or
sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are
still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is
a sort of negative condition, as if some  tie were loosened, and then
the absolute freedom quickly follows; when, however , the freedom
ceases the change-back or relapse come s quickly , preceded only by a
spell of warning silence. To-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore
all the signs of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her
making a violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very
few minutes, however , gave her comp lete control of herself; then,
motioning her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was
half reclining, she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking
her husband’ s hand in hers began:—
“We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I
know , dear; I know that you will always  be with me to the end.” This
was to her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon
hers. “In the morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows
what may be in store for any of us. You are going to be so good to
me as to take me with you. I know that all that brave earnest men can
do for a poor weak woman, whose soul perhaps is lost—no, no, not
yet, but is at any rate at stake—you will do. But you must remember
that I am not as you are. There is a poison in my blood, in my soul,
which may destroy me; which must destroy me, unless some relief
comes to us. Oh, my friends, you know as well as I do, that my soul
is at stake;  and though I know there is one way out for me, you must
not and I must not take it!” She looked appealingly to us all in turn,
beginning and ending with her husband. “What is that way?” asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. “What is
that way , which we must not—may not—take?”
“That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another ,
before the greater evil is entirely wrought. I know , and you know ,
that were I once dead you could and would set free my immortal
spirit, even as you did my poor Lucy’ s. Were death, or the fear of
death, the only thing that stood in the way I would not shrink to die
here, now, amidst the friends who love me. But death is not all. I
cannot believe that to die in such a case, when there is hope before6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 247/291us and a bitter task to be done, is God’s will. Therefore, I, on my
part, give up here the certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the
dark where may be the blackest things that the world or the nether
world holds!” We were all silent, for we knew instinctively that this
was only a prelude. The faces of the others were set and Harker ’s
grew ashen grey; perhaps he guessed better than any of us what was
coming. She continued:—
“This is what I can give into the hotch-pot.” I could not but note
the quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all
seriousness. “What will each of you give? Your lives I know ,” she
went on quickly , “that is easy for brave men. Your lives are God’ s,
and you can give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?”
She looked again questioningly , but this time avoided her husband’ s
face. Quincey seemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. “Then I shall tell you plainly what I want, for there must be no
doubtful matter in this connection between us now. You must
promise me, one and all—even you, my beloved husband—that,
should the time come, you will kill me.”
“What is that time?” The voice was Quincey’ s, but it was low and
strained. “When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is
better that I die than I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh,
then you will, without a moment’ s delay , drive a stake through me
and cut off my head ; or do whatever else may be wanting to give me
rest!”
Quincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before
her and taking her hand in his said solemnly:—
“I’m only a rough fellow , who hasn’ t, perhaps, lived as a man
should to win such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold
sacred and dear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch
from the duty that you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I
shall make  all certain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the
time has come!”
“My true friend!” was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears,
as, bending over , she kissed his hand. “I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!” said Van Helsing. “And I!” said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to
her to take the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to
her wan-e yed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy
whiteness of his hair , and asked:—
“And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?”
“You too, my dearest,” she said, with infinite yearning of pity in
her voice and eyes. “You must not shrink. You are nearest and
dearest and all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life
and all time. Think, dear, that there have  been times when brave men
have killed their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from
falling into the hands of the enemy . Their hands did not falter any the
more because those that they loved implored them to slay them. It is
men’ s duty towards those whom they love, in such times of sore
trial! And oh, my dear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any
hand, let it be at the hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing,
I have not forgotten your mercy in poor Lucy’ s case to him who6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 248/291loved”—she stopped with a flying blush, and changed her phrase
—“to him who had best right to give her peace. If that time shall
come again, I look to you to make it a happy memory of my
husband’ s life that it was his loving hand which set me free from the
awful thrall upon me.”
“Again I swear!” came the Professor ’s resonant voice. Mrs. Harker smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned
back and said:—
“And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never
forget: this time, if it ever come,  may come quickly and
unexpectedly , and in such case you must lose no time in using your
opportunity . At such a time I myself might be—nay! if the time ever
comes, shall be —leagued with your enemy against you.”
“One more request;” she became very solemn as she said this, “it
is not vital and necessary like the other , but I want you to do one
thing for me, if you will.” We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there
was no need to speak:—
“I want you to read the Burial Service.”  She was interrupted by a
deep groan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it
over her heart, and continued: “You must read it over me some day. Whatever may be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be
a sweet thought to all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope
read it, for then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever—
come what may!”
“But oh, my dear one,” he pleaded, “death is afar of f from you.”
“Nay ,” she said, holding up a warning hand. “I am deeper in death
at this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon
me!”
“Oh, my wife, must I read it?” he said, before he began. “It would comfort me, my husband!” was all she said; and he
began to read when she had got the book ready . “How can I—how could any one—tell of that strange scene, its
solemnity , its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its
sweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of
bitter truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to
the heart had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends
kneeling round that stricken and sorrow ing lady; or heard the tender
passion of her husb and’s voice, as in tones so broken with emotion
that often he had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service
from the Burial of the Dead. I—I cannot go on—words—and—v-
voice—f-fail m-me!”
 
She was right in her instinct. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it
may hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the
time, it comforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker ’s coming relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so
full of despair to any of us as we had dreaded. Jonathan Harker ’s Journal.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"15 Octobe r, Varna. —We left Charing Cross on the mornin g of the
12th, got to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us
in the Orient Expre ss. We travelled night and day, arriving here at6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 249/291about five o’clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if
any telegram had arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to
this hotel—“the Odessus.” The journey  may have had incidents; I
was, howe ver, too eager to get on, to care for them. Until the Czarina
Catherine  comes into port there will be no interest for me in
anything in the wide world.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Thank God! Mina is well, and looks to
be getting stronger; her colour is coming back. She sleeps a great
deal; throughout the journey she slept  nearly all the time. Before
sunrise and sunset, however , she is very wakeful and alert; and it has
become a habit for Van Helsing to hypnotise her at such times. At
first, some effort was needed, and he had to make many passes; but
now, she seems to yield at once, as if by habit, and scarcely any
action is needed. He seems to have  power at these particular
moments to simply will, and her though ts obey him. He always asks
her what she can see and hear . She answers to the first:—
“Nothing; all is dark.” And to the second:—
“I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water
rushing by. Canvas and cordage strain  and masts and yards creak. The wind is high—I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws
back the foam.” It is evident that the Czarina Catherine  is still at sea,
hastening on her way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had four telegram s, one each day since we started, and all to the
same effect: that the Czarina Catherine  had not been reported to
Lloyd’ s from anywh ere. He had arrange d before leaving London that
his agent should send him every day a telegram saying if the ship
had been reported. He was to have a message even if she were not
reported, so that he might be sure that there was a watch being kept
at the other end of the wire. We had dinner and went to bed early . To-morrow we are to see the
Vice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the
ship as soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be
to get on the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he
takes the form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own
volition, and so cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to
man’ s form without suspicion—which he evidently wishes to avoid
—he must remain in the box. If, then, we can come on board after
sunrise, he is at our mercy; for we can open the box and make sure of
him, as we did of poor Lucy , before he wakes. What mercy he shall
get from us will not count for much. We think that we shall not have
much trouble with officials or the seamen. Thank God! this is the
country where bribery can do anything , and we are well supplied
with mone y. We have only to make sure that the ship cannot come
into port between sunset and sunrise without our being warned, and
we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I think! 16 October .—Mina’ s report still the same: lapping waves and
rushing water, darkness and favouring winds. We are evidently in
good time, and when we hear of the Czarina Catherine  we shall be
ready . As she must pass the Dardanelle s we are sure to have some
report. .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

welcome the Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the
shippers that he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain
something stolen from a friend of his, and got a half consent that he
might open it at his own risk. The owner gave him a paper telling the
Captain to give him every facility in doing whatever he chose on
board the ship, and also a similar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who was much impressed with Godalming’ s
kindly manner to him, and we are all satisfied that whatever he can
do to aid our wishes  will be done. We have already arranged what to
do in case we get the box open. If the Count is there, Van Helsing
and Seward will cut off his head at once and drive a stake through
his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall prevent interference,
even if we have to use the arms which we shall have ready . The
Professor says that if we can so treat the Count’ s body , it will soon
after fall into dust. In such case there would be no evidence against
us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But even if it were
not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps some day this
very script may be evidence to come between some of us and a rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it were to
come.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

Dr. Sewar d’s Diary . 25 October .—How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a
pen is irksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild
with excitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from
Lloyd’ s. I know now what men feel in battle when the call to action
is heard. Mrs. Harker , alone of our party , did not show any signs of
emotion. After all, it is not strange that she did not; for we took
special care not to let her know anything  about it, and we all tried not
to show any excitem ent when we were  in her presence. In old days
she would, I am sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have
tried to conceal it; but in this way she is greatly changed during the
past three  weeks. The lethar gy grows  upon her, and though she
seems strong and well, and is getting back some of her colour , Van
Helsing and I are not satisfied. We talk of her often; we have not,
however , said a word to the others. It would break poor Harker ’s
heart—certainly his nerve—if he knew that we had even a suspicion
on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me, her teeth very
carefully , whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for he says that so
long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active danger of a6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

take steps !...","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"We both know what those steps would have to be,
though we do not mention our thoughts to each other . We should
neither of us shrink from the task—awful though it be to

am grateful to whoever invented it. It is only about 24 hours’  sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the
rate the Czarina Catherine  has come from London. She should
therefore arrive some time in the mornin g; but as she cannot possibly
get in before then, we are all about to retire early . We shall get up at

possible that we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a
fever of excitement,  except Harker , who is calm; his hands are cold
as ice, and an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great
Ghoorka knife whic h he now always carries with him. It will be a
bad lookout for the Count if the edge of that “Kukri” ever touches
his throat, driven by that stern, ice-cold hand! Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Harker to-day . About noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like;
although we kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy
about it. She had been restless all the morning, so that we were at
first glad to know  that she was sleeping. When, however , her
husband mentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly that he
could not wake her, we went to her room to see for ourselves. She
was breat hing naturally and looked so well and peaceful that we
agreed that the sleep was better for her than anything else. Poor girl,
she has so much to forget that it is no wonder that sleep, if it brings
oblivion to her , does her good. Later .—Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing
sleep of some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better
than she had been for days. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic
report. Wherever he may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying
to his destination. To his doom, I trust! 26 October .—Another day and no tidings of the Czarina
Catherine . She ough t to be here by now. That she is still journeying
somewher e is appare nt, for Mrs. Harker ’s hypnotic report at sunrise
was still the same. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at
times, for fog; some of the steamers which came in last evening
reported patches of fog both to north and south of the port. We must
continue our watching, as the ship may now be signalled any
moment. 27 October , Noon. —Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait
for.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Mrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual:
“lapping waves and rushing water ,” though she added that “the
waves were very faint.” The telegrams from London have been the
same: “no further report.” Van Helsing  is terribly anxious, and told6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

significantly:—
“I did not like that lethar gy of Madam Mina’ s. Souls and

him more, but Hark er just then came in, and he held up a warning
hand. We must try to-night at sunset to make her speak more fully

"M. V ice Consul, V arna. “Czarina Catherine  reported entering Galatz at one o’clock to-
day.”
Dr. Sewar d’s Diary . 28 October .—When the telegram came announcing the arrival in
Galatz I do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have
been expe cted. True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the
bolt would come; but I think we all expected that something strange
would happen. The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually
satisfied that things would not be just as we had expected; we only
waited to learn where the change would occur . None the less,
however , was it a surprise.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I suppose that nature works on such a
hopeful basis that we believe against ourselves that things will be as
they ought to be, not as we should  know that they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if it be a will-o’-
the-wisp to man. It was an odd experience and we all took it
differently . Van Helsing raised his hand  over his head for a moment,
as though in remons trance with the Almighty; but he said not a word,
and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. Lord
Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily . I was myself
half stunn ed and looked in wonder at one after another . Quincey
Morris tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so
well; in our old wandering days it mean t “action.” Mrs. Harker grew
ghastly white, so that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but
she folded  her hands meekly and looked up in prayer . Harker smiled
—actually smiled—the dark, bitter smile of one who is without
hope; but at the same time his action belied his words, for his hands
instinctively sought the hilt of the great Kukri knife and rested there. “When does the next train start for Galatz?” said Van Helsing to us
generally . “At 6:30 to-morrow  morning!” We all started, for the answer came
from Mrs. Harker . “How on earth do you know?” said Art. “You forget—or perhaps you do not know , though Jonathan does
and so does Dr. Van Helsing—that I am the train fiend. At home in
Exeter I always used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful
to my husband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a
study of the time-tab les now. I knew that if anything were to take us
to Castle Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through
Bucharest, so I learn ed the times very carefully . Unhappily there are
not many to learn, as the only train to-morrow leaves as I say .”
“Wonderful woman!” murmured the Professor .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 253/291“Can’ t we get a special?” asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing
shook his head: “I fear not. This land is very different from yours or
mine; even if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as
soon as our regular train. Moreover , we have something to prepare.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"We must think. Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur , go to the
train and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in
the morning. Do you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and
get from him letters  to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make
search the ship just as it was here. Morris Quincey , you see the Vice-
Consul, and get his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to
make our way smooth, so that no times be lost when over the
Danube. John will stay with Madam Mina and me, and we shall
consult. For so if time be long you may be delayed; and it will not
matter when the sun set, since I am here with Madam to make
report.”
“And I,” said Mrs. Harker brightly , and more like her old self than
she had been for many a long day, “shall try to be of use in all ways,
and shall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is
shifting from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have
been of late!” The three younger men looked happier at the moment
as they seemed to realise the significa nce of her words; but Van
Helsing and I, turning to each other , met each a grave and troubled
glance. We said nothing at the time, however .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked
Mrs. Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part
of Harker ’s journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the
door was shut upon her he said to me:—
“We mean the same!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"speak out!”
“There is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may
deceive us.”
“Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?”
“No!” said I, “unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me
alone.”
“You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell
you something.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"And oh, my friend, I am taking a great—a terrible—
risk; but I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said
those words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came
to me. In the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to
read her mind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in
the ship with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learn then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open
life with eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his
coffin-box. Now he make his most effort to escape us. At present he
want her not. “He is sure with his so great knowledge  that she will come at his
call; but he cut her off—take her, as he can do, out of his own power ,
that so she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-
brains that have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace
of God, will come higher than his child- brain that lie in his tomb for
centuries, that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work
selfish and therefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to
her of her trance! She know it not; and it would overwhelm her and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

most we want all her great brain which is trained like man’ s brain,
but is of sweet woman and have a special power which the Count
give her, and which  he may not take away altogether—though he
think not so. Hush!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"let me speak, and you shall learn. Oh, John, my
friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never feared before. We can
only trust the good God.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Silence! here she comes!”
I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have
hysterics, just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he
controlled himself and was at perfec t nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into the room, bright and happy-looking and, in the
doing of work, seem ingly forgetful of her misery . As she came in,
she handed a numb er of sheets of typewriting to Van Helsing. He
looked over them gravely , his face brightening up as he read. Then
holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said:—
“Friend John, to you with so much of experience already—and
you, too, dear Madam Mina, that are young—here is a lesson: do not
fear ever to think. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain,
but I fear to let him loose his wings. Here now, with more
knowledge, I go back to where that half-thought come from and I
find that he be no half-thought at all; that be a whole thought, though
so young that he is not yet strong to use his little wings. Nay, like the
“Ugly Duck” of my friend Hans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at
all, but a big swan- thought that sail nobly on big wings, when the
time come for him to try them. See I read here what Jonathan have
written:—
“That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again,
brought his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who,
when he was beaten  back, came again, and again, and again, though
he had to come alone from the bloody  field where his troops were
being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately
triumph.”
“What does this tell us? Not much?","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"no! The Count’ s child-thought
see nothin g; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see
nothing; my man-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there
comes another word from some one who speak without thought
because she, too, know not what it mean—what it might  mean. Just
as there are elements which rest, yet when in nature’ s course they
move on their way and they touch—th en pouf! and there comes a
flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill and destroy some; but
that show up all earth below for leagues and leagues. Is it not so?","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever study the philosophy
of crime? ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’  You, John, yes; for it is a study of insanity . You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not—not but once. Still,
your mind  works true, and argues not a particul ari ad universale . There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant, in all countries
and at all times, that even police, who know not much from
philosophy , come to know it empirically , that it is. That is to be
empiric. The criminal always work at one crime—that is the true
criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none
other . This criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning
and resourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be of
child-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 255/291crime also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what
he have done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not
by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is
to him the ground to start from to do more. ‘Dos pou sto,’ said
Archimedes. ‘Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!’  To do
once, is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and
until he have the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same
again every time, just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that
your eyes are opene d, and that to you the lightning flash show all the
leagues,” for Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes
sparkled. He went on:—
“Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you
see with those so bright eyes.” He took her hand and held it whilst
she spoke . His finger and thumb close d on her pulse, as I thought
instinctively and unconsciously , as she spoke:—
“The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and
Lombroso would so classify him, and quâ criminal he is of
imperfectly formed mind. Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek
resource in habit. His past is a clue, and the one page of it that we
know—and that from his own lips—tel ls that once before, when in
what Mr. Morris would call a ‘tight place,’ he went back to his own
country from the land he had tried to invade, and thence, without
losing purpose, prepared himself for a new effort. He came again
better equipped for his work; and won. So he came to London to
invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all hope of success was
lost, and his existen ce in danger , he fled back over the sea to his
home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube from
Turkey Land.”
“Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!” said Van Helsing,
enthusiastically , as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later
he said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room
consultation:—
“Seventy-two only;  and in all this excitement. I have hope.”
Turning to her again, he said with keen expectation:—
“But go on. Go on!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid;
John and I know . I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Speak, without fear!”
“I will try to; but you will for give me if I seem egotistical.”
“Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.”
“Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small
and his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one
purpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the
Danube, leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on
being safe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul
somewhat from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that
dreadful night. I felt it! Oh, I felt it!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that
haunts me is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used
my knowledge for his ends.” The Professor stood up:—
“He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,
whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to
Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 256/291us. But his child-mi nd only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is
in God’ s Providence , the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned
on for his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter
is taken in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he
think he is free from  every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us
with so many hours  to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper
him to sleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing
your mind , there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where
he fail! That terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you
free to go to him in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of
freedom, when the sun rise and set. At such times you go by my
volition and not by his; and this power to good of you and others, as
you have won from your suffering at his hands. This is now all the
more precious that he know it not, and to guard himself have even
cut himsel f off from his knowledge of our where. We, however , are
not selfish, and we believe that God is with us through all this
blackness, and these many dark hours. We shall follow him; and we
shall not flinch; even if we peril ourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great hour; and it have done much to
advance us on our way. You must be scribe and write him all down,
so that when the others return from their work you can give it to
them; then they shall know as we do.”
And so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker has written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS. to us.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

DR. SEWARD’S DIARY
29 Octobe r.—This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of
us had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and
endeavour , and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our
journey , and for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual
time came  round Mrs. Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic
effort; and after a longer and more serious effort on the part of Van
Helsing than has been usually necessary , she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but this time the Professor had to ask
her questions, and to ask them pretty resolutely , before we could
learn anything; at last her answer came:—
“I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but
only a steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser . I can
hear men’ s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars
in the rowlocks. A gun is fired somewh ere; the echo of it seems far
away . There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are
dragged along. Wha t is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the
air blowing upon me.”
Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively , from where she
lay on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if
lifting a weight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with
understanding. Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at
her intently , whilst Harker ’s hand instinctively closed round the hilt
of his Kukri. There  was a long pause. We all knew that the time
when she could speak was passing; but we felt that it was useless to
say anything. Suddenly she sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said
sweetly:—
“Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!”
We could only make  her happy , and so acquiesced. She bustled off to
get tea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:—
“You see, my friend s. He is close to land: he has left his earth-
chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie hidden
somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do not
touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be in
the night, change his form and can jump  or fly on shore, as he did at
Whitby . But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he
be carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs
men may discover what the box contain . Thus, in fine, if he escape
not on shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day
lost to him. We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night
we shall come on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he
dare not be his true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.”
There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the
dawn; at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 258/291Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety , for her
response in her trance. The hypnotic  stage was even longer in
coming than before; and when it came the time remaining until full
sunrise was so short that we began to despair . Van Helsing seemed to
throw his whole soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will
she made reply:—
“All is dark. I hear lapping water , level with me, and some
creaking as of wood on wood.” She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till to-night. And so it is that we are travelling towa rds Galatz in an agony of
expectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the
morning; but already , at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we
cannot possibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two
more hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may
possibly throw more light on what is happening. Later .—Sunset has come and gone. Fortunate ly it came at a time
when there was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at
a station, we migh t not have secure d the necessary calm and
isolation. Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less
readily than this morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the
Count’ s sensations may die away , just when we want it most. It
seems to me that her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she
has been in the trance hitherto she has confined herself to the
simplest of facts. If this goes on it may ultimately mislead us. If I
thought that the Count’ s power over her would die away equally with
her power of knowledge it would be a happy thought; but I am afraid
that it may not be so. When she did speak, her words were
enigmatical:—
“Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I
can hear, far off, confused sounds—a s of men talking in strange
tongues, fierce-falling water , and the howling of wolves.” She
stopped and a shudd er ran through her, increasing in intensity for a
few seconds, till, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy . She said
no more, even in answer to the Professor ’s imperative questioning. When she woke from the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and
languid; but her mind was all alert. She could not remember
anything, but asked what she had said; when she was told, she
pondered over it deeply for a long time and in silence. 30 Octobe r, 7 a. m.—We are near Galat z now, and I may not have
time to write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by
us all. Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic
trance, Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They
produced no effect, however , until the regular time, when she yielded
with a still greater difficulty , only a minute before the sun rose. The
Professor lost no time in his questioning; her answer came with
equal quickness:—
“All is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the
creaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another
sound, a queer one like——” She stopped and grew white, and
whiter still.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 259/291“Go on; go on! Speak, I command you!” said Van Helsing in an
agonised voice. At the same time there  was despair in his eyes, for
the risen sun was reddening even Mrs. Harker ’s pale face. She
opened her eyes, and we all started as she said, sweetly and
seemingly with the utmost unconcern:—
“Oh, Profe ssor, why ask me to do what you know I can’t? I don’t
remember anything.” Then, seeing the look of amazement on our
faces, she said, turning from one to the other with a troubled look:—
“What have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I
was lying  here, half asleep, and heard  you say ‘go on! speak, I
command you!’  It seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if
I were a bad child!”
“Oh, Madam Mina,”  he said, sadly , “it is proof, if proof be needed,
of how I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken
more earnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her
whom I am proud to obey!”

"30 October .—Mr . Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms
had been ordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be
spared, since he does not speak any foreign language. The forces
were distributed much as they had been at Varna, except that Lord
Godalming went to the Vice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an
immediate guarantee of some sort to the official, we being in
extreme hurry . Jonathan and the two doctors went to the shipping
agent to learn particulars of the arrival of the Czarina Catherine . Later .—Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away , and
the Vice-Consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by a
clerk. He was very obliging, and of fered to do anything in his power . Jonathan Harker ’s Journal. 30 October .—At nine o’clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I
called on Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkof f, the agents of the London
firm of Hapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer
to Lord Godalming ’s telegraphed request, asking us to show them
any civility in their power . They were more than kind and courteous,
and took us at once  on board the Czarina Catherine , which lay at
anchor out in the river harbour . There we saw the Captain, Donelson
by name, who told us of his voyage. He said that in all his life he had
never had so favourable a run. “Man!” he said, “but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we
should have to pay for it wi’ some rare piece o’ ill luck, so as to keep
up the average. It’s no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi’
a wind ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin’  on yer sail
for his ain purpose. An’ a’ the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we
were nigh a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and
travelled wi’ us, till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the
deil a thing could we see. We ran by Gibraltar wi’oot bein’  able to
signal; an’ till we came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our
permit to pass, we never were within hail o’ aught. At first I inclined6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 260/291to slack off sail and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I
thocht that if the Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick,
he was like to do it whether we woul d or no. If we had a quick
voyage it would be no to our miscredit wi’ the owners, or no hurt to
our traffic; an’ the Old Mon who had served his ain purpose wad be
decently grateful to us for no hinderin’  him.” This mixture of
simplicity and cunning, of superstition and commercial reasoning,
aroused Van Helsing, who said:—
“Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by
some; and he know when he meet his match!” The skipper was not
displeased with the compliment, and went on:—
“When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble;
some o’ them, the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave
overboard a big box which had been put on board by a queer lookin’
old man just before we had started frae London. I had seen them
speer at the fellow , and put out their twa fingers when they saw him,
to guard against the evil eye.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Man! but the supersteetion of
foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot their business
pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I felt a wee bit as
they did anent something, though I wouldn’t say it was agin the big
box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn’ t let up for five days I
joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get somewheres
—well, he would fetch it up a’reet. An’ if he didn’ t, well, we’d keep
a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and deep
water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin’  sun came
through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz. The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take
out the box and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi’ them aboot it
wi’ a handspike; an’ when the last o’ them rose off the deck wi’ his
head in his hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye,
the property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than
in the river Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck
ready to fling in, and as it was marked Galatz via Varna, I thocht I’d
let it lie till we discharged in the port an’ get rid o’t althegither . We
didn’ t do much clearin’  that day, an’ had to remain the nicht at
anchor; but in the mornin’, braw an’ airly, an hour before sun-up, a
man came  aboard wi’ an order , written to him from England, to
receive a box marked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter
was one ready to his hand. He had his papers a’ reet, an’ glad I was to
be rid o’ the dam’  thing, for I was beginnin’  masel’  to feel uneasy at
it. If the Deil did have any luggage aboord the ship, I’m thinkin’  it
was nane ither than that same!”
“What was the name of the man who took it?” asked Dr. Van
Helsing with restrained eagerness. “I’ll be tellin’  ye quick!” he answered, and, stepping down to his
cabin, produced a receipt signed “Immanuel Hildesheim.” Burgen-
strasse 16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain
knew; so with thanks we came away . We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi
Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were
pointed with specie—we doing the punctuation—and with a little
bargaining he told us what he knew .","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

customs, a box which would arrive at Galatz in the Czarina
Catherine . This he was to give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky ,
who dealt with the Slovaks who traded down the river to the port. He
had been paid for his work by an English bank note, which had been
duly cashed for gold at the Danube International Bank. When
Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to the ship and handed
over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all he knew . We then sought for Skinsky , but were unable to find him. One of
his neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that
he had gone away two days before, no one knew whither . This was
corroborated by his landlord, who had received by messenger the
key of the house together with the rent due, in English money . This
had been between ten and eleven o’clo ck last night.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

standstill again. Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped

by some wild animal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to
see the horror , the women crying out “This is the work of a Slovak!”
We hurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into
the af fair, and so detained. As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

were all convinced that the box was on its way, by water , to

"Mina Harker ’s Memorandum. (Entered in her Journal.)
Ground of inquiry .—Count Dracula’ s problem is to get back to his
own place. (a) He must be brought back by some one. This is evident; for had
he power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or
wolf, or bat, or in some other way. He evidently fears discovery or
interference, in the state of helplessne ss in which he must be—
confined as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box. (b) How is he to be taken? —Here a process of exclusions may
help us. By road, by rail, by water? 1. By Road. —There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving
the city . (x) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate. A
hint, a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would
destroy him. (y) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi of ficers to pass. (z) His pursu ers might  follow . This is his highest fear; and in order
to prevent his being  betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even
his victim—me! 2.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"By Rail. —There is no one in charge of the box. It would have to
take its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with
enemies on the track. True, he might escape at night; but what would
he be, if left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not what he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"3. By Water.—Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most
danger in another . On the water he is powerless except at night; even
then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were he wrecke d, the living water would engulf him, helpless;
and he would indeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land;
but if it were unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his
position would still be desperate. We know from the record that he was on the water; so what we
have to do is to ascertain what  water . The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we
may, then, get a light on what his later task is to be. Firstly .—We must differentiate between what he did in London as
part of his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments
and had to arrange as best he could. Secondly  we must see, as well as we can surmise  it from the facts
we know of, what he has done here. As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent
invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of
exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 263/291escape. The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to
Immanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away the box befor e sunrise. There is also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky . These we must only
guess at; but there must have been some letter or message, since
Skinsky came to Hildesheim. That, so far, his plans were successful we know . The Czarina
Catherine  made a phenomenally quick journey—so much so that
Captain Donelson’ s suspicions were aroused; but his superstition
united with his canniness played the Count’ s game for him, and he
ran with his favouri ng wind through fogs and all till he brought up
blindfold at Galatz. That the Count’ s arrangements were well made,
has been proved. Hildesheim cleared the box, took it off, and gave it
to Skinsky . Skinsky took it—and here we lose the trail. We only
know that the box is somewhere on the water , moving along. The
customs and the octroi, if there be any , have been avoided. Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival
—on land , at Galatz. The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count
could appe ar in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen
at all to aid in the work? In my husband’ s diary , Skinsky is
mentioned as dealing with the Slovaks who trade down the river to
the port; and the man’ s remark, that the murder was the work of a
Slovak, showed the general feeling against his class. The Count
wanted isolation. My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back
to his castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was
brought from the castle by Szgany , and probably they delivered their
cargo to Slovaks who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were
shipped for London. Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons
who could  arrange this service. When the box was on land, before
sunrise or after sunset, he came out from his box, met Skinsky and
instructed him what to do as to arrangin g the carriage of the box up
some river. When this was done, and he knew that all was in train, he
blotted out his traces, as he thought, by murdering his agent. I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for
the Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read
in the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water
swirling level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in
his box, then, was on a river in an open boat—propelled probably
either by oars or poles, for the banks are near and it is working
against stream. There would be no such sound if floating down
stream. Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may
possibly investigate further . Now of these two, the Pruth is the more
easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza
which runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly
as close to Dracula’ s castle as can be got by water . Mina Harker ’s Journal—continued. When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed
me. The others kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing
said:—6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 264/291“Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher . Her eyes have
been where we were blinded. Now we are on the track once again,
and this time we may succeed. Our enemy is at his most helpless;
and if we can come on him by day, on the water , our task will be
over. He has a start, but he is powerless to hasten, as he may not
leave his box lest those who carry him may suspect; for them to
suspect would be to prompt them to throw him in the stream where
he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men, to our Council of
War; for , here and now , we must plan what each and all shall do.”
“I shall get a steam launch and follow him,” said Lord Godalming. “And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,” said
Mr. Morris. “Good!” said the Professor , “both good. But neither must go
alone. There must be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak
is strong and rough, and he carries rude arms.” All the men smiled,
for amongst them they carried a small arsenal. Said Mr . Morris:—
“I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a
crowd, and there may be wolves. The Count, if you remember , took
some other precautions; he made some  requisitions on others that
Mrs. Hark er could not quite hear or understand. We must be ready at
all points.” Dr . Seward said:—
“I think I had better  go with Quincey . We have been accustomed
to hunt together , and we two, well armed, will be a match for
whatever may come along.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"You must not be alone, Art. It may be
necessary to fight the Slovaks, and a chance thrust—for I don’t
suppose these fellows carry guns—wou ld undo all our plans. There
must be no chances, this time; we shall not rest until the Count’ s
head and body have been separated, and we are sure that he cannot
re-incarnate.” He looked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathan
looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was torn about in his
mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the boat service
would, most likely , be the one which would destroy the ... the ...","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"the
... Vampir e. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was silent
awhile, and during his silence Dr . Van Helsing spoke:—
“Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because
you are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be
needed at the last; and again that it is your right to destroy him—that
—which has wroug ht such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for
Madam Mina; she will be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are
not so quick to run as once; and I am not used to ride so long or to
pursue as need be, or to fight with lethal weapons. But I can be of
other service; I can fight in other way. And I can die, if need be, as
well as younger men. Now let me say that what I would is this: while
you, my Lord Goda lming and friend Jonathan go in your so swift
little steamboat up the river, and whilst John and Quincey guard the
bank wher e perchance he might be landed, I will take Madam Mina
right into the heart of the enemy’ s country . Whilst the old fox is tied
in his box, floating on the running strea m whence he cannot escape
to land—w here he dares not raise the lid of his coffin-box lest his
Slovak carriers shou ld in fear leave him to perish—we shall go in the
track wher e Jonathan went,—from Bistritz over the Borgo, and find
our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam Mina’ s hypnotic
power will surely help, and we shall find our way—all dark and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker

fateful place. There is much to be done,  and other places to be made
sanctify , so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.” Here Jonathan
interrupted him hotly:—
“Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring
Mina, in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil’ s illness,
right into the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for
Heaven or Hell!” He became almost speechless for a minute, and
then went on:—
“Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of
hellish infamy—with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes,
and every speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster
in embryo ? Have you felt the Vampire’ s lips upon your throat?” Here
he turned to me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his
arms with a cry: “Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror
upon us!” and he sank down on the sofa in a collapse of misery . The
Professor ’s voice, as he spoke in clear , sweet tones, which seemed to
vibrate in the air , calmed us all:—
“Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that
awful place that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into
that place.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"There is work—wild work—to be done there, that her
eyes may not see. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with
their own eyes what is to be done before that place can be purify . Remember that we are in terrible straits . If the Count escape us this
time—and he is strong and subtle and cunning—he may choose to
sleep him for a century , and then in time our dear one”—he took my
hand—“would come to him to keep him company , and would be as
those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You have told us of their
gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they clutched the
moving bag that the Count threw to them.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"You shudder; and well
may it be.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is
necessary . My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving,
possibly my life? If it were that any one went into that place to stay,
it is I who would have to go to keep them company .”
“Do as you will,” said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all
over, “we are in the hands of God!”
 
Later .—Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men
worked. How can women help loving men when they are so earnest,

that Lord Godalming is rich, and that both he and Mr. Morris, who

did not, our little expedition could not start, either so promptly or so
well equipped, as it will within another hour. It is not three hours

"Night. —I am writing this in the light from the furnace
door of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up. He is an
experienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his
own on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding
our plans, we finally  decided that Mina’ s guess was correct, and that
if any waterway was chosen for the Count’ s escape back to his
Castle, the Sereth and then the Bistritza  at its junction, would be the
one. We took it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north
latitude, would be the place chosen for the crossing the country
between the river and the Carpathians. We have no fear in running at
good speed up the river at night; there  is plenty of water , and the
banks are wide enough apart to make steaming, even in the dark,
easy enou gh. Lord Godalming tells me to sleep for a while, as it is
enough for the prese nt for one to be on watch. But I cannot sleep—
how can I with the terrible danger hanging over my darling, and her
going out into that awful place.... My only comfort is that we are in
the hands of God. Only for that faith it would be easier to die than to
live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Morris and Dr. Seward
were off on their long ride before we started; they are to keep up the
right bank , far enough off to get on higher lands where they can see a
good stretch of river and avoid the following of its curves. They
have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead their spare horses
—four in all, so as not to excite curiosity . When they dismiss the
men, which shall be shortly , they shall themselves look after the
horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they can mount
our whole party . One of the saddles has a movable horn, and can be
easily adapted for Mina, if required. It is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along
through the darknes s, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up
and strike us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it
all comes home. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and
unknown ways; into a whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the furnace door .... 31 October .—Still hurrying along. The day has come, and

we have passed only a few open boats, but none of them had on
board any box or package of anything like the size of the one we
seek. The men were scared every time we turned our electric lamp on
them, and fell on their knees and prayed. 1 November , evening.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"—No news all day; we have found nothing
of the kind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we
are wrong in our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled
every boat, big and little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a
Government boat, and treated us accordingly . We saw in this a way
of smoothing matters, so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the
Sereth, we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously . With every  boat which we have over-hauled since then this trick has
succeeded; we have had every deference shown to us, and not once
any objection to whatever we chose to ask or do. Some of the
Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them, going at more than usual
speed as she had a double crew on board. This was before they came
to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the boat turned into the
Bistritza or continue d on up the Sereth. At Fundu we could not hear
of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the night. I am
feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon me,
and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he shall
keep the first watch. God bless him for all his goodness to poor dear
Mina and me. 2 November , morning. —It is broad daylight. That good fellow
would not wake me. He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept
peacefully and was forgetting my troubl e. It seems brutally selfish to
me to have slept so long, and let him watch all night; but he was
quite right. I am a new man this morning ; and, as I sit here and watch
him sleeping, I can do all that is necessary both as to minding the
engine, steering, and keeping watch. I can feel that my strength and
energy are coming back to me. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van
Helsing. They should have got to Veresti about noon on Wednesday . It would take them some time to get the carriage and horses; so if
they had started and travelled hard, they would be about now at the
Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I am afraid to think what may
happen. If we could only go faster! but we cannot; the engines are
throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless streams running
down the mountain s into this river, but as none of them are very
large—at present, at all events, though they are terrible doubtless in
winter and when the snow melts—the horsemen may not have met
much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see
them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be
necessary to take counsel together what to do next. Dr.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

knowledge. Some went up only a few hours before. Godalming is an

trim again. Finally , they got up the rapids all right, with local help,
and are off on the chase afresh. I fear that the boat is not any better

MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL
1 Novemb er.—All day long we have travelled, and at a good
speed. The horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated,
for they go willingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had
so many changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are
encouraged to think that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van
Helsing is laconic; he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz,
and pays them well to make the exchang e of horses. We get hot soup,
or coffee, or tea; and off we go.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"It is a lovely country; full of beauties
of all imaginable kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and
simple, and seem full of nice qualities. They are very, very
superstitious.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"In the first house where we stopped, when the woman
who served us saw the scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and
put out two fingers towards me, to keep off the evil eye. I believe
they went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into our
food; and I can’t abide garlic. Ever since then I have taken care not
to take off my hat or veil, and so have escaped their suspicions. We
are travell ing fast, and as we have no driver with us to carry tales, we
go ahead of scandal; but I daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow
hard behin d us all the way. The Profess or seems tireless; all day he
would not take any rest, though he made me sleep for a long spell. At
sunset time he hypnotised me, and he says that I answered as usual
“darkness, lapping water and creaking wood”; so our enemy is still
on the river. I am afraid to think of Jonathan, but somehow I have
now no fear for him, or for myself. I write this whilst we wait in a
farmhouse for the horses to be got ready . Dr. Van Helsing is sleeping. Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and grey, but his mouth is set
as firmly as a conqueror ’s; even in his sleep he is instinct with
resolution. When we have well started I must make him rest whilst I
drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us, and we must not
break down when most of all his strength will be needed.... All is
ready; we are of f shortly . 2 November , morning. —I was successful, and we took turns
driving all night; now the day is on us, bright though cold. There is a
strange heaviness in the air—I say heaviness for want of a better
word; I mean that it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our
warm furs keep us comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised
me; he says I answered “darkness, creaking wood and roaring
water ,” so the river  is changing as they ascend. I do hope that my
darling will not run any chance of danger—more than need be; but
we are in God’ s hands. 2 Novemb er, night.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"

so that now we have a rude four-in-hand . The dear horses are patient
and good, and they give us no trouble. We are not worried with other
travellers, and so even I can drive. We shall get to the Pass in
daylight; we do not want to arrive before. So we take it easy, and
have each a long rest in turn. Oh, what will to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poor darling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright, and that He will deign to
watch over my husband and those dear to us both, and who are in
such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in His sight. Alas! I am
unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deign to let me stand
forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurred His wrath. Memorandum by Abraham V an Helsing. 4 November .—This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D.,

"It may explain. It is
morning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept alive—
Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey heavy
sky is full of snow , which when it falls will settle for all winter as the
ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to have affected Madam
Mina; she has been  so heavy of head all day that she was not like
herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleep s! She who is usual so alert,
have done  literally nothing all the day; she even have lost her
appetite. She make no entry into her little diary , she who write so
faithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well. However , to-night she is more vif. Her long sleep all day have refresh
and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset
I try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown
less and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether . Well,
God’ s will be done—whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may
lead! Now to the histori cal, for as Madam Mina write not in her
stenography , I must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of
us may not go unrecorded. We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We
stopped our carriage, and got down so that there might be no
disturbance. I made a couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying
down, yield herself as usual, but more slow and more short time than
ever, to the hypnoti c sleep. As before, came the answer: “darkness
and the swirling of water .” Then she woke, bright and radiant and we
go on our way and soon reach the Pass.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"At this time and place, she
become all on fire with zeal; some new guiding power be in her
manifested, for she point to a road and say:—
“This is the way .”
“How know you it?” I ask. “Of course I know it,” she answer , and with a pause, add: “Have
not my Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 271/291At first I think some what strange, but soon I see that there be only
one such by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the
coach road from the Bukovina to Bistr itz, which is more wide and
hard, and more of use. So we came down  this road; when we meet other ways—not
always were we sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect
and light snow have  fallen—the horses know and they only. I give
rein to them, and they go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the
things which Jonathan have note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long hours and hours. At the first, I tell
Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and she succeed. She sleep all the
time; till at the last, I feel myself to suspicious grow , and attempt to
wake her. But she sleep on, and I may not wake her though I try. I do
not wish to try too hard lest I harm her; for I know that she have
suffer much, and sleep at times be all-in-all to her. I think I drowse
myself, for all of sudden I feel guilt, as though I have done
something; I find myself bolt up, with the reins in my hand, and the
good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I look down and find
Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset time, and over
the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood, so that we
throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep. For
we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky , as though
it were the end of the world. Then I arouse Mada m Mina. This time she wake with not much
trouble, and then I try to put her to hypn otic sleep. But she sleep not,
being as though I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her
and myself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone
down. Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now
quite awak e, and look so well as I neve r saw her since that night at
Carfax when we first enter the Count’ s house. I am amaze, and not at
ease then; but she is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I
forget all fear. I light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with
us, and she prepare food while I undo the horses and set them,
tethered in shelter , to feed. Then when I return to the fire she have
my supper  ready . I go to help her; but she smile, and tell me that she
have eat already—th at she was so hungry that she would not wait. I
like it not, and I have grave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I
am silent of it. She help me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur
and lie beside the fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But
presently I forget all of watching; and when I sudden remember that
I watch, I find her lying quiet, but awak e, and looking at me with so
bright eyes. Once, twice more the same occur , and I get much sleep
till before  morning. When I wake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes obedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise
up, and up, and up; and then sleep come  to her too late, but so heavy
that she will not wake. I have to lift her up, and place her sleeping in
the carriage when I have harnessed the horses and made all ready . Madam still sleep, and she look in her sleep more healthy and more
redder than before. And I like it not.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"And I am afraid, afraid, afraid! —I am afraid of all things—even to think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and death, or more than these, and we
must not flinch. 6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 272/2915 November , morning. —Let me be accurate in everything, for
though you and I have seen some strange things together , you may at
the first think that I, Van Helsing, am mad—that the many horrors
and the so long strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain. All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and
moving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great,
frowning precipices  and much falling water , and Nature seem to
have held sometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep;
and though I did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her
—even for food. I began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was
upon her, tainted as she is with that Vampire baptism. “Well,” said I
to myself, “if it be that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do
not sleep at night.” As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an
ancient and imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found
Madam Mina still sleeping, and the sun low down. But all was
indeed changed; the frowning mountains seemed further away , and
we were near the top of a steep-rising hill, on summit of which was
such a castle as Jonathan tell of in his diary . At once I exulted and
feared; for now , for good or ill, the end was near . I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas! unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us—for
even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow ,
and all was for a time in a great twilight—I took out the horses and
fed them in what shelter I could. Then  I make a fire; and near it I
make Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit
comfortable amid her rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat,
simply saying that she had not hunger . I did not press her, knowing
her unavailingness. But I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong
for all. Then, with the fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so
big for her comfort, round where Madam Mina sat; and over the ring
I passed some of the wafer , and I broke it fine so that all was well
guarded. She sat still all the time—so still as one dead; and she grew
whiter and ever whiter till the snow was not more pale; and no word
she said. But when I drew near, she clung to me, and I could know
that the poor soul shook her from head to feet with a tremor that was
pain to feel. I said to her presently , when she had grown more quiet:
—
“Will you not come over to the fire?” for I wished to make a test
of what she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step
she stopped, and stood as one stricken. “Why not go on?” I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back,
sat down in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one
waked from sleep, she said simply:—
“I cannot!” and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what
she could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there
might be danger to her body , yet her soul was safe! Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I
came to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on
them, they whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were
quiet for a time. Many times through the night did I come to them,
till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every
time my coming was with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 273/291began to die, and I was about stepping forth to replenish it, for now
the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the
dark there  was a light of some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it
seemed as though the snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took
shape as of women with trailing garments. All was in dead, grim
silence only that the horses whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of
the worst. I began to fear—horrible fears; but then came to me the
sense of safety in that ring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that
my imagin ings were of the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I
have gone through, and all the terrible anxiety . It was as though my
memories of all Jonathan’ s horrid experience were befooling me; for
the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round, till I
could get as though a shadowy glimpse  of those women that would
have kisse d him. And then the horses cowered lower and lower , and
moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even the madness of fright was
not to them, so that they could break away . I feared for my dear
Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when I would
have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held me
back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low it
was:—
“No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!” I turned to her,
and looking in her eyes, said:—
“But you? It is for you that I fear!” whereat she laughed—a laugh,
low and unreal, and said:—
“Fear for me! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from
them than I am,” and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a
puff of wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her
forehead. Then, alas!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I knew . Did I not, I would soon have learned,
for the wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer , but keeping
ever witho ut the Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till—if
God have not take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes—
there were  before me in actual flesh the same three women that
Jonathan saw in the room, when they would have kissed his throat. I
knew the swaying round forms, the bright hard eyes, the white teeth,
the ruddy colour , the voluptuous lips. They smiled ever at poor dear
Madam Mina; and as their laugh came through the silence of the
night, they twined their arms and pointe d to her, and said in those so
sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were of the intolerable
sweetness of the water -glasses:—
“Come, sister. Come  to us. Come! Come!” In fear I turned to my
poor Mada m Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for
oh! the terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror , told a story
to my heart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of
them. I seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding
out some of the Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They
drew back  before me, and laughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the
fire, and feared them  not; for I knew that we were safe within our
protections. They could not approach , me, whilst so armed, nor
Madam Mina whilst she remained within the ring, which she could
not leave no more than they could enter. The horses had ceased to
moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on them softly , and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 274/291they grew  whiter . I knew that there was for the poor beasts no more
of terror . And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the
snow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid , and full of woe and terror;
but when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me
again. At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in
the whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved
away towards the castle, and were lost. Instinctively , with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina,
intending to hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep,
from whic h I could not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her
sleep, but she made  no response, none  at all; and the day broke. I
fear yet to stir.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"I have made my fire and have seen the horses, they
are all dead. To-day  I have much to do here, and I keep waiting till
the sun is up high; for there may be places where I must go, where
that sunlight, though snow and mist obscure it, will be to me a safety . I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible
work. Madam Mina  still sleeps; and, God be thanked! she is calm in

may be our own feelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear
the howli ng of wolves; the snow brings them down from the
mountains, and there are dangers to all of us, and from all sides. The
horses are nearly ready , and we are soon off. We ride to death of

left Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to

Veresti was useful; though the doors were all open I broke them off
the rusty hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them,
so that being entered I might not get out. Jonathan’ s bitter experience
served me here.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"By memory of his diary I found my way to the old
chapel, for I knew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it
seemed as if there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 275/291me dizzy . Either there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the
howl of wolves. Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I
was in terrible plight. The dilemma had me between his horns. Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the
Vampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! I
resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must
submit, if it were God’ s will. At any rate it was only death and
freedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself
the choice had been  easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in
than the grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with
my work. I knew that there were at least three graves to find—graves that
are inhabit ; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in
her Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I
shudder as though I have come to do murder . Ah, I doubt not that in
old time, when such things were, many a man who set forth to do
such a task as mine, found at the last his heart fail him, and then his
nerve. So he delay , and delay , and delay , till the mere beauty and the
fascination of the wanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he
remain on and on, till sunset come, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair woman open and look love, and
the volupt uous mout h present to a kiss—and man is weak. And there
remain one more victim in the Vampire  fold; one more to swell the
grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!... There is some fasci nation, surely , when I am moved by the mere
presence of such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with
age and heavy with the dust of centurie s, though there be that horrid
odour such as the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved—I,
Van Helsing, with all my purpose and with my motive for hate—I
was moved to a yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my
faculties and to clog my very soul. It may have been that the need of
natural sleep, and the strange oppression of the air were beginning to
overcome me. Certain it was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-
eyed sleep  of one who yields to a sweet fascination, when there came
through the snow-st illed air a long, low wail, so full of woe and pity
that it woke me like the sound of a clarion. For it was the voice of
my dear Madam Mina that I heard. Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by
wrenching away tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark
one. I dared not pause to look on her as I had on her sister , lest once
more I should begin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until,
presently , I find in a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved
that other fair sister which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself
out of the atoms of the mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly
beautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in
me, which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers,
made my head whirl with new emotion. But God be thanked, that
soul-wail of my dear Madam Mina had not died out of my ears; and,
before the spell could be wrought further upon me, I had nerved
myself to my wild work. By this time I had searched all the tombs in
the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as there had been only three of
these Un-D ead phan toms around us in the night, I took it that there
were no more of active Un-Dead existent. There was one great tomb6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 276/291more lordl y than all the rest; huge it was, and nobly proportioned. On
it was but one word
DRACULA. This then was the Un-Dead home of the King-V ampire, to whom
so many more were due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make
certain what I knew . Before I began to restore these women to their
dead selve s through my awful work, I laid in Dracula’ s tomb some of
the Wafer, and so banished him from it, Un-Dead, for ever . Then bega n my terrible task, and I dread ed it. Had it been but one,
it had been  easy, comparative.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"But three! To begin twice more after I
had been through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the
sweet Miss Lucy , what would it not be with these strange ones who
had survived through centuries, and who had been strengthened by
the passing of the years; who would, if they could, have fought for
their foul lives.... Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been
nerved by thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung
such a pall of fear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble
even yet, though till all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did
stand. Had I not seen the repose in the first place, and the gladness
that stole over it just ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that
the soul had been won, I could not have gone further with my
butchery . I could not have endured the horrid screeching as the stake
drove home; the plunging of writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and left my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them now and weep, as I think of them
placid each in her full sleep of death for a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife severed the head of each,
before the whole body began to melt away and crumble in to its
native dust, as though the death that should have come centuries
agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud “I am
here!”
Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can
the Count enter there Un-Dead. When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke
from her sleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured
too much. “Come!” she said, “come away from this awful place! Let us go to
meet my husband who is, I know , coming towards us.” She was
looking thin and pale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed
with fervour . I was glad to see her paleness and her illness, for my
mind was full of the fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep. And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to
meet our friends—and him—whom Madam Mina tell me that she
know  are coming to meet us. Mina Harker ’s Journal.","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"6 Novemb er.—It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and
I took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was
coming. We did not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill,
for we had to take heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face
the possibility of being left without warm th in the cold and the snow .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 277/291We had to take some of our provisions, too, for we were in a perfect
desolation, and, so far as we could see through the snowfall, there
was not even the sign of habitation. When we had gone about a mile,
I was tired with the heavy walking and sat down to rest. Then we
looked back and saw where the clear line of Dracula’ s castle cut the
sky; for we were so deep under the hill whereon it was set that the
angle of perspective  of the Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur , perched a thousand feet on the summit
of a sheer  precipice , and with seemingl y a great gap between it and
the steep of the adjacent mountain on any side. There was something
wild and uncanny about the place. We could hear the distant howling
of wolves. They were far off, but the sound, even though coming
muffled through the deadening snowfa ll, was full of terror . I knew
from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searc hing about that he was trying
to seek some strategic point, where we would be less exposed in case
of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we could trace it
through the drifted snow . In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and
joined him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow
in a rock, with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He
took me by the hand and drew me in: “See!” he said, “here you will
be in shelter; and if the wolves do come I can meet them one by
one.” He brought in our furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got
out some provisions  and forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to
even try to do so was repulsive to me, and, much as I would have
liked to please him, I could not bring myself to the attempt. He
looked very sad, but did not reproach me. Taking his field-glasses
from the case, he stood on the top of the rock, and began to search
the horizon. Suddenly he called out:—
“Look! Madam Mina, look! look!” I sprang up and stood beside
him on the rock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow
was now falling more heavily , and swirled about fiercely , for a high
wind was beginning to blow . However , there were times when there
were pauses between the snow flurries and I could see a long way
round. From the height where we were it was possible to see a great
distance; and far off, beyond the white waste of snow , I could see the
river lying like a black ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far off—in fact, so near that I
wondered we had not noticed before—came a group of mounted men
hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a long leiter -wagon
which swept from side to side, like a dog’s tail wagging, with each
stern inequ ality of the road. Outlined against the snow as they were, I
could see from the men’ s clothes that they were peasants or gypsies
of some kind. On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it,
for I felt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing
close, and well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then
imprisoned there, would take new freedom and could in any of many
forms elude all pursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my
consternation, however , he was not there. An instant later, I saw him
below me. Round the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had
found shelter in last night. When he had completed it he stood beside
me again, saying:—6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 278/291“At least you shall be safe here from him!” He took the glasses
from me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space
below us. “See,” he said, “they come quickly; they are flogging the
horses, and galloping as hard as they can.” He paused and went on in
a hollow voice:—
“They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God’ s will be
done!” Down came another blinding rush of driving snow , and the
whole landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however , and once
more his glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:—
“Look! Look!","Dracula, by Bram Stoker.pdf"
"Look! See, two horseme n follow fast, coming up
from the south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look
before the snow blots it all out!” I took it and looked. The two men
might be Dr. Seward  and Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither
of them was Jonathan. At the same time I knew  that Jonathan was not
far off; looking around I saw on the north side of the coming party
two other men, ridin g at break-neck speed. One of them I knew was
Jonathan, and the other I took, of course, to be Lord Godalming. They , too, were pursuing the party with the cart. When I told the
Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy , and, after looking
intently till a snow fall made sight impo ssible, he laid his Winchester
rifle ready  for use against the boulder at the opening of our shelter . “They are all conver ging,” he said. “When the time comes we shall
have gyps ies on all sides.” I got out my revolver ready to hand, for
whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came louder and
closer . When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again. It
was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,
and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down
towards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I
could see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes
and lar ger numbers—the wolves were gathering for their prey . Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came
now in fierce bursts , and the snow was driven with fury as it swept
upon us in circling eddies. At times we could not see an arm’s length
before us; but at others, as the hollow-s ounding wind swept by us, it
seemed to clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset,
that we knew with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that
before long the sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our
watches it was less than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter
before the various bodies began to conv erge close upon us. The wind
came now with fiercer and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily
from the north. It seemingly had driven the snow clouds from us, for,
with only occasional bursts, the snow  fell. We could distinguish
clearly the individuals of each party , the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realise, or at least to
care, that they were  pursued; they seem ed, however , to hasten with
redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and lower on the mountain
tops. Closer and closer they drew . The Professor and I crouched down
behind our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was
determined that they should not pass. One and all were quite
unaware of our presence.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 279/291All at once two voices shouted out to: “Halt!” One was my
Jonathan’ s, raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris’
strong resolute tone of quiet command . The gypsies may not have
known the language, but there was no mistaking the tone, in
whatever tongue the words were spoken . Instinctively they reined in,
and at the instant Lord Godalming and Jonathan dashed up at one
side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the other . The leader of the
gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his horse like a centaur ,
waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his companions some
word to proceed. They lashed the horse s which sprang forward; but
the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an unmistakable
way comm anded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van Helsing
and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them. Seeing
that they were surro unded the men tightened their reins and drew up. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of
the gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and
held himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant. The leader , with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out
in front, and pointin g first to the sun—now close down on the hill
tops—and then to the castle, said something which I did not
understand. For answer , all four men of our party threw themselves
from their horses and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt
terrible fear at seeing Jonathan in such danger , but that the ardour of
battle must have been upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no
fear, but only a wild, surging desire to do something. Seeing the
quick movement of our parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a
command; his men instantly formed round the cart in a sort of
undisciplined endeavour , each one shouldering and pushing the other
in his eagerness to carry out the order . In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the
ring of men, and Quincey on the other , were forcing a way to the
cart; it was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before
the sun should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies
in front, nor the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even
attract their attention. Jonathan’ s impetuosity , and the manifest
singleness of his purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him;
instinctively they cowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he
had jumped upon the cart, and, with a strength which seemed
incredible, raised the great box, and flung it over the wheel to the
ground. In the meantime, Mr. Morris had had to use force to pass
through his side of the ring of Szgan y. All the time I had been
breathlessly watching Jonathan I had, with the tail of my eye, seen
him pressing desperately forward, and had seen the knives of the
gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and they cut at him. He
had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first I thought that he
too had come through in safety; but as he sprang beside Jonathan,
who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that with his left
hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was spurting
through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for as
Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,
attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked
the other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 280/291the lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound,
and the top of the box was thrown back. By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the
Winchesters, and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward,
had given in and made no resistance. The sun was almost down on
the mount ain tops, and the shadows of the whole group fell long
upon the snow . I saw the Count lying within the box upon the earth,
some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared
with the horrible vindictive look which I knew too well. As I looke d, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in
them turned to triumph. But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan’ s great
knife. I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the
same moment Mr . Morris’ s bowie knife plunged into the heart. It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the
drawing of a breath , the whole body crumbled into dust and passed
from our sight. I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final
dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never
could have imagined might have rested there. The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky , and every
stone of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the
setting sun. The gyps ies, taking us as in some way the cause of the
extraordinary disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a
word, and rode away as if for their lives. Those who were
unmounted jumped upon the leiter -wagon and shouted to the
horsemen not to desert them. The wolves, which had withdrawn to a
safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving us alone. Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow ,
holding his hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through
his fingers . I flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me
back; so did the two doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the
wounded man laid back his head on his shoulder . With a sigh he
took, with a feeble effort, my hand in that of his own which was
unstained. He must have seen the anguish of my heart in my face, for
he smiled at me and said:—
“I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!” he
cried sudd enly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me,
“It was worth for this to die! Look! look!”
The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red
gleams fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With
one impul se the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest
“Amen” broke from all as their eyes followed the pointing of his
finger . The dying man spoke:—
“Now God be thank ed that all has not been in vain! See! the snow
is not more stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!”
And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a
gallant gentleman.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 281/291NOTE
Seven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness
of some of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we
endured. It is an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy’s birthday
is the same day as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother
holds, I know , the secret belief that some of our brave friend’ s spirit
has passed into him. His bundle of names links all our little band of
men together; but we call him Quincey . In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and
went over the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and
terrible memories. It was almost imposs ible to believe that the things
which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears
were living truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The castle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation. When we got home  we were talking of the old time—which we
could all look back on without despair , for Godalming and Seward
are both happily married. I took the papers from the safe where they
had been ever since  our return so long ago. We were struck with the
fact, that in all the mass of material of which the record is composed,
there is hardly one authentic document; nothing but a mass of
typewriting, except the later note-books of Mina and Seward and
myself, and Van Helsing’ s memorandum. We could hardly ask any
one, even did we wish to, to accept these as proofs of so wild a story . Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with our boy on his knee:—
“We want no proofs; we ask none to believe us! This boy will
some day know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is. Already he knows her sweetness and loving care; later on he will
understand how some men so loved her, that they did dare much for
her sake.”

Project Gutenber g™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its
mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed
works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form
accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated
equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws
regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of
the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform
and it takes a considerable ef fort, much paperwork and many
fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not
solicit donations in locations where we have not received
written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONA TIONS or
determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
www .gutenber g.org/donate . While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states
where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Dracula, by Bram Stoker
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345-images.html 290/291of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from
donors in such states who approach us with of fers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
our small staf f. Please check the Project Gutenber g web pages for current
donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a
number of other ways including checks, online payments and
credit card donations. To donate, please visit:

Gutenberg™ electronic works
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenber g™ concept of a library of electronic works that could
be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenber g™ eBooks with only a loose
network of volunteer support. Project Gutenber g™ eBooks are often created from several
printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by
copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with
any particular paper edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www .gutenber g.org. This website includes information about Project Gutenber g™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenber g
Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear

A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a
tree which  bore golden apples. These apples were always counted,
and about the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that
every night one of them was gone.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"The king became very angry at
this, and ordered the gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his eldest son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he
fell asleep, and in the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was ordered to watch; and at midnight he too
fell asleep, and in the morning another apple was gone. Then the
third son offered to keep watch; but the gardener at first would not
let him, for fear some harm should come to him: however , at last he
consented, and the young man laid himself under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling noise in the air, and a
bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as it was snapping at one
of the apples with its beak, the gardener ’s son jumped up and shot an
arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm; only it dropped a
golden feather from its tail, and then flew away . The golden feather
was broug ht to the king in the morning, and all the council was
called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than all the
wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, ‘One feather is of no use to
me, I must have the whole bird.’
Then the gardener ’s eldest son set out and thought to find the
golden bird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he
came to a wood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so
he took his bow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, ‘Do
not shoot me, for I will give you good counsel; I know what your
business is, and that you want to find the golden bird. You will reach
a village in the evening; and when you get there, you will see two
inns oppo site to each other , one of which is very pleasant and
beautiful to look at: go not in there, but rest for the night in the other ,
though it may appear to you to be very poor and mean.’  But the son
thought to himself, ‘What can such a beast as this know about the
matter?’  So he shot his arrow at the fox; but he missed it, and it set
up its tail above its back and ran into the wood. Then he went his
way, and in the evening came to the village where the two inns were;
and in one of these were people singing , and dancing, and feasting;
but the other looked very dirty, and poor. ‘I should be very silly,’ said
he, ‘if I went to that shabby house, and left this charming place’; so
he went into the smart house, and ate and drank at his ease, and
forgot the bird, and his country too. Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no
tidings were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing
happened to him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but
when he came to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the
window where the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in;
and he could not withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot
the golden bird and his country in the same manner .6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 5/201Time passed on again, and the youngest  son too wished to set out
into the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would
not listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and
was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent
his coming back. However , at last it was agreed he should go, for he
would not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox,
and heard the same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox,
and did not attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said,
‘Sit upon my tail, and you will travel faster .’ So he sat down, and the
fox began  to run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick
that their hair whistled in the wind. When they came to the village, the son followed the fox’s counsel,
and without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested
there all night at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met
him as he was begin ning his journey , and said, ‘Go straight forward,
till you come to a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers
fast asleep and snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle
and pass on and on till you come to a room, where the golden bird
sits in a wooden cage; close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but
do not try to take the bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the
handsome one, otherwise you will repent it.’ Then the fox stretched
out his tail again, and the young man sat himself down, and away
they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind. Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went
in and found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden
cage, and below stood the golden cage,  and the three golden apples
that had been lost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself,
‘It will be a very droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this
shabby cage’; so he opened the door and took hold of it and put it
into the golden cage. But the bird set up such a loud scream that all
the soldie rs awoke, and they took him prisoner and carried him
before the king. The next morning the court sat to judge him; and
when all was heard, it sentenced him to die, unless he should bring
the king the golden horse which could run as swiftly as the wind; and
if he did this, he was to have the golden bird given him for his own. So he set out once  more on his journey , sighing, and in great
despair , when on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, ‘You
see now what has happened on account of your not listening to my
counsel. I will still, however , tell you how to find the golden horse, if
you will do as I bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the
castle where the horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the
groom fast asleep and snoring: take away the horse quietly , but be
sure to put the old leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one
that is close by it.’ Then the son sat down on the fox’s tail, and away
they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind. All went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the
golden saddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a
great pity to put the leathern saddle upon it. ‘I will give him the good
one,’  said he; ‘I am sure he deserves it.’ As he took up the golden
saddle the groom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran
in and took him prisoner , and in the morning he was again brought
before the court to be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 6/201agreed, that, if he could bring thither the beautiful princess, he
should live, and have the bird and the horse given him for his own. Then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and
said, ‘Why did not you listen to me? If you had, you would have
carried away both the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give
you counsel. Go straight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a
castle. At twelve o’clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-
house: go up to her and give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her
away; but take care you do not suffer her to go and take leave of her
father and mother .’ Then the fox stretch ed out his tail, and so away
they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled again. As they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at
twelve o’clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and
gave her the kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged
with many tears that he would let her take leave of her father . At first
he refused, but she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till
at last he consented; but the moment she came to her father ’s house
the guards awoke and he was taken prisoner again. Then he was brought before the king, and the king said, ‘You shall
never have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill
that stops the view from my window .’ Now this hill was so big that
the whole world could not take it away:  and when he had worked for
seven days, and had done very little, the fox came and said. ‘Lie
down and go to sleep; I will work for you.’  And in the morning he
awoke and the hill was gone; so he went merrily to the king, and told
him that now that it was removed he must give him the princess. Then the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the
young man and the princess; and the fox came and said to him, ‘We
will have all three, the princess, the horse, and the bird.’  ‘Ah!’  said
the young man, ‘that would be a great thing, but how can you
contrive it?’
‘If you will only listen,’  said the fox, ‘it can be done. When you
come to the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must
say, “Here  she is!” Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount
the golden horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to
take leave of them; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift
her quickl y on to the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side,
and gallop away as fast as you can.’
All went right: then the fox said, ‘When you come to the castle
where the bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you
will ride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right
horse, he will bring  out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that
you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and
when you get it into your hand, ride away .’
This, too, happened  as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the
princess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the
fox came, and said, ‘Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.’
But the young man refused to do it: so the fox said, ‘I will at any rate
give you good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from
the gallow s, and sit down by the side of no river.’ Then away he
went. ‘Well,’ though t the young man, ‘it is no hard matter to keep
that advice.’6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 7/201He rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village
where he had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise
and uproar; and when he asked what was the matter , the people said,
‘Two men are going  to be hanged.’  As he came nearer , he saw that
the two men were his brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said,
‘Cannot they in any way be saved?’  But the people said ‘No,’  unless
he would bestow all his money upon the rascals and buy their liberty . Then he did not stay to think about the matter , but paid what was
asked, and his brothers were given up, and went on with him towards
their home. And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was
so cool and pleasant that the two broth ers said, ‘Let us sit down by
the side of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.’  So he said,
‘Yes,’ and forgot the fox’s counsel, and sat down on the side of the
river; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw
him down the bank , and took the princess, the horse, and the bird,
and went home to the king their master , and said. ‘All this have we
won by our labour .’ Then there was great rejoicing made; but the
horse would not eat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept. The youngest son fell to the bottom of the river ’s bed: luckily it
was nearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was
so steep that he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came
once more, and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise
no evil would have befallen him: ‘Yet,’ said he, ‘I cannot leave you
here, so lay hold of my tail and hold fast.’ Then he pulled him out of
the river, and said to him, as he got upon the bank, ‘Your brothers
have set watch to kill you, if they find you in the kingdom.’  So he
dressed himself as a poor man, and came secretly to the king’ s court,
and was scarcely within the doors when  the horse began to eat, and
the bird to sing, and the princess left off weeping. Then he went to
the king, and told him all his brothers’  roguery; and they were seized
and punished, and he had the princess given to him again; and after
the king’ s death he was heir to his kingdom. A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the
old fox met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him,
and cut off his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment
the fox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of
the princess, who had been lost a great many many years.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

Some men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes
right—all that falls to them is so much gain—all their geese are
swans—all their cards are trumps—toss them which way you will,
they will always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only
move on so much the faster . The world may very likely not always
think of them as they think of themselves, but what care they for the
world?","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
what can it know about the matter?,"Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"One of these lucky beings was neighbo ur Hans. Seven long years
he had worked hard for his master . At last he said, ‘Master , my time
is up; I must go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray
pay me my wages and let me go.’ And the master said, ‘You have
been a faithful and good servant, Hans, so your pay shall be
handsome.’  Then he gave him a lump of silver as big as his head. Hans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into
it, threw it over his shoulder , and jogged  off on his road homewards. As he went lazily on, dragging one foot after another , a man came in
sight, trotting gaily along on a capital horse. ‘Ah!’  said Hans aloud,
‘what a fine thing it is to ride on horseba ck! There he sits as easy and
happy as if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips
against no stones, saves shoe-leather , and gets on he hardly knows
how.’ Hans did not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and
said, ‘Well, friend, why do you go on foot then?’  ‘Ah!’  said he, ‘I
have this load to carry: to be sure it is silver , but it is so heavy that I
can’t hold up my head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder
sadly .’ ‘What do you say of makin g an exchange?’  said the
horseman. ‘I will give you my horse, and you shall give me the
silver; which will save you a great deal of trouble in carrying such a
heavy load about with you.’  ‘With all my heart,’  said Hans: ‘but as
you are so kind to me, I must tell you one thing—you will have a
weary task to draw  that silver about with you.’  However , the
horseman got off, took the silver , helped Hans up, gave him the
bridle into one hand and the whip into the other , and said, ‘When you
want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together , and cry “Jip!”’
Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up,
squared his elbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode
merrily of f, one minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,
‘No care and no sorrow,
A fig for the morrow! We’ll laugh and be merry,
Sing neigh down derry!’
After a time he thought he should like to go a little faster , so he
smacked his lips and cried ‘Jip!’  Away went the horse full gallop;
and before  Hans knew what he was abou t, he was thrown off, and lay
on his back by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a
shepherd who was coming by, driving  a cow, had not stopped it.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 9/201Hans soon came to himself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed,
and said to the sheph erd, ‘This riding is no joke, when a man has the
luck to get upon a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as
if it would  break his neck. However , I’m off now once for all: I like
your cow now a great deal better than this smart beast that played me
this trick, and has spoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle;
which, by the by, smells not very like a nosegay . One can walk along
at one’s leisure behind that cow—keep good company , and have
milk, butte r, and cheese, every day, into the bargain. What would I
give to have such a prize!’  ‘Well,’ said the shepherd, ‘if you are so
fond of her, I will change my cow for your horse; I like to do good to
my neighbours, even though I lose by it myself.’  ‘Done!’  said Hans,
merrily . ‘What a noble heart that good  man has!’  thought he. Then
the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans and the cow good
morning, and away he rode. Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while,
and then drove off his cow quietly , and thought his bargain a very
lucky one. ‘If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall
always be able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and
cheese with it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink
the milk: and what can I wish for more?’  When he came to an inn, he
halted, ate up all his bread, and gave away his last penny for a glass
of beer. When he had rested himself he set off again, driving his cow
towards his mother ’s village. But the heat grew greater as soon as
noon came on, till at last, as he found himself on a wide heath that
would take him more than an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and
parched that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth. ‘I can find a
cure for this,’  thought he; ‘now I will milk my cow and quench my
thirst’: so he tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap
to milk into; but not a drop was to be had. Who would have thought
that this cow, which was to bring him milk and butter and cheese,
was all that time utterly dry? Hans had not thought of looking to that. While he was trying his luck in milking , and managing the matter
very clumsily , the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome;
and at last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down;
and there he lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came
by, driving a pig in a wheelbarrow . ‘What is the matter with you, my
man?’  said the butcher , as he helped him up. Hans told him what had
happened, how he was dry, and wanted  to milk his cow, but found
the cow was dry too. Then the butch er gave him a flask of ale,
saying, ‘There, drink and refresh yourself; your cow will give you no
milk: don’t you see she is an old beast, good for nothing but the
slaughter -house?’  ‘Alas, alas!’  said Hans, ‘who would have thought
it? What a shame to take my horse, and give me only a dry cow! If I
kill her, what will she be good for? I hate cow-beef; it is not tender
enough for me.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"If it were a pig now—like that fat gentleman you are
driving along at his ease—one could do something with it; it would
at any rate make sausages.’  ‘Well,’ said the butcher , ‘I don’t like to
say no, when one is asked to do a kind, neighbourly thing. To please
you I will change, and give you my fine fat pig for the cow.’ ‘Heaven
reward you for your kindness and self-denial!’  said Hans, as he gave
the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the wheel-barrow , drove it
away , holding it by the string that was tied to its leg.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 10/201So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had
met with some misfortunes, to be sure;  but he was now well repaid
for all. How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion
as he had at last got? The next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white
goose. The countrym an stopped to ask what was o’clock; this led to
further chat; and Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many
good bargains, and how all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman then began to tell his tale, and said he was going to
take the goose to a christening. ‘Feel,’  said he, ‘how heavy it is, and
yet it is only eight weeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find
plenty of fat upon it, it has lived so well!’  ‘You’re right,’  said Hans,
as he weighed it in his hand; ‘but if you talk of fat, my pig is no
trifle.’  Meantime the countryman began  to look grave, and shook his
head. ‘Hark ye!’ said he, ‘my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of
fellow , so I can’t help doing you a kind turn.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Your pig may get you
into a scrape. In the village I just came from, the squire has had a pig
stolen out of his sty. I was dreadfully afraid when I saw you that you
had got the squire’ s pig. If you have, and they catch you, it will be a
bad job for you.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"The least they will do will be to throw you into the
horse-pond. Can you swim?’
Poor Hans was sadly frightened. ‘Good man,’  cried he, ‘pray get
me out of this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either
bred or born; but he may have been the squire’ s for aught I can tell:
you know this country better than I do, take my pig and give me the
goose.’  ‘I ought to have something into the bargain,’  said the
countryman; ‘give a fat goose for a pig, indeed! ‘Tis not everyone
would do so much for you as that. However , I will not be hard upon
you, as you are in trouble.’  Then he took the string in his hand, and
drove off the pig by a side path; while Hans went on the way
homewards free from care. ‘After all,’ thought he, ‘that chap is pretty
well taken  in. I don’t care whose pig it is, but wherever it came from
it has been a very good friend to me. I have much the best of the
bargain.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"First there will be a capital roast; then the fat will find me in
goose-grease for six months; and then there are all the beautiful
white feathers. I will put them into my pillow , and then I am sure I
shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my mother will be!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Talk of a pig, indeed!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Give me a fine fat goose.’
As he came to the next village, he saw a scissor -grinder with his
wheel, working and singing,
‘O’er hill and o’er dale
So happy I roam,
Work light and live well,
All the world is my home;
Then who so blythe, so merry as I?’
Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, ‘You must be
well off, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.’  ‘Yes,’
said the other, ‘mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his
hand into his pocket  without finding money in it—but where did you
get that beautiful goose?’  ‘I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.’ ‘And
where did you get the pig?’  ‘I gave a cow for it.’ ‘And the cow?’  ‘I
gave a horse for it.’ ‘And the horse?’  ‘I gave a lump of silver as big6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

seven long years.’  ‘You have thriven well in the world hitherto,’  said
the grinde r, ‘now if you could find money in your pocket whenever
you put your hand in it, your fortune would be made.’  ‘Very true: but
how is that to be managed?’  ‘How? Why , you must turn grinder like
myself,’  said the other; ‘you only want a grindstone; the rest will
come of itself. Here is one that is but little the worse for wear: I
would not ask more than the value of your goose for it—will you
buy?’  ‘How can you ask?’  said Hans; ‘I should be the happiest man
in the world, if I could have money whenever I put my hand in my
pocket: what could I want more? there’ s the goose.’  ‘Now ,’ said the
grinder , as he gave him a common rough stone that lay by his side,
‘this is a most capital stone; do but work  it well enough, and you can
make an old nail cut with it.’
Hans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes
sparkled for joy, and he said to himself, ‘Surely I must have been
born in a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of
itself. People are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a

Meantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given
away his last penny in his joy at getting the cow . At last he could go no farther , for the stone tired him sadly: and he
dragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of
water , and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on
the bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a
little, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then
sprang up and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and
thanked Heaven, with tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking
away his only plague, the ugly heavy stone. ‘How happy am I!’ cried he; ‘nobody was ever so lucky as I.’ Then
up he got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on
till he reached his mother ’s house, and told her how very easy the
road to good luck was.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep
gloomy wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy
could take any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in
the form of an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night
she always became an old woman again. When any young man came
within a hundred paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and
could not move a step till she came and set him free; which she
would not do till he had given her his word never to come there
again: but when any pretty maiden came within that space she was
changed into a bird, and the fairy put her into a cage, and hung her
up in a chamber in the castle. There were seven hundred of these
cages hanging in the castle, and all with beautiful birds in them. Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was
prettier than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a
shepherd lad, whose  name was Jorinde l, was very fond of her, and
they were  soon to be married. One day they went to walk in the
wood, that they might be alone; and Jorindel said, ‘We must take
care that we don’t go too near to the fairy’ s castle.’  It was a beautiful
evening; the last rays of the setting sun shone bright through the long
stems of the trees upon the green underw ood beneath, and the turtle-
doves sang from the tall birches. Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side;
and both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to
be parted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way;
and when they looked to see which way they should go home, they
found themselves at a loss to know what path to take. The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk
behind the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw
through the bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close
under the old walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale,
and trembled. Jorinda was just singing,
 ‘The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,
  Well-a-day! Well-a-day! He mourn’d for the fate of his darling mate,
  Well-a-day!’
when her song stopp ed suddenly . Jorindel turned to see the reason,
and beheld  his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song
ended with a mournful jug, jug. An owl with fiery eyes flew three
times round them, and three times screamed:
 ‘Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!’
Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could
neither weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went
quite down; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a
moment after the old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring
eyes, and a nose and chin that almost met one another .6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

went away with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was
gone—but what could he do? He could not speak, he could not move
from the spot where  he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang
with a hoarse voice:
 ‘Till the prisoner is fast,
  And her doom is cast,
  There stay! Oh, stay!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"When the charm is around her,
  And the spell has bound her,
  Hie away! away!’
On a sudd en Jorinde l found himself free. Then he fell on his knees
before the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda:
but she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then
she went her way . He prayed, he wept , he sorrowed, but all in vain. ‘Alas!’  he said,
‘what will become of me?’  He could not go back to his own home, so
he went to a strange village, and employ ed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle
as he dared go, but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda. At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower ,
and that in the middle of it lay a costly  pearl; and he dreamt that he
plucked the flower , and went with it in his hand into the castle, and
that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there
he found his Jorinda again. In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and
dale for this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in
vain: but on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the
beautiful purple flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop,
as big as a costly pearl. Then he plucked the flower , and set out and
travelled day and night, till he came again to the castle. He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not
become fixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to
the door. Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched
the door with the flower , and it spran g open; so that he went in
through the court, and listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven
hundred birds singing in the seven hundred cages. When she saw
Jorindel she was very angry , and scream ed with rage; but she could
not come within two yards of him, for the flower he held in his hand
was his safeguard. He looked around at the birds, but alas! there
were many , many nightingales, and how then should he find out
which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to do, he saw the
fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the best of
her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched the
cage with the flowe r, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her
arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as
when they walked together in the wood. Then he touched all the other birds with the flower , so that they all
took their old form s again; and he took Jorinda home, where they
were married, and lived happily together many years: and so did a
good many other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the
old fairy’ s cages by themselves, much longer than they liked.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant
to him a great many years, but was now growing old and every day
more and more unfit for work. His master therefore was tired of
keeping him and began to think of puttin g an end to him; but the ass,
who saw that some mischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off,
and began his journe y towards the great  city, ‘For there,’  thought he,
‘I may turn musician.’
After he had travel led a little way, he spied a dog lying by the
roadside and panting as if he were tired. ‘What makes you pant so,
my friend?’  said the ass. ‘Alas!’  said the dog, ‘my master was going
to knock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no
longer make myself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what
can I do to earn my livelihood?’  ‘Hark ye!’ said the ass, ‘I am going
to the great city to turn musician: supp ose you go with me, and try
what you can do in the same way?’  The dog said he was willing, and
they jogged on together . They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle
of the road and making a most rueful face. ‘Pray , my good lady,’ said
the ass, ‘what’ s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!’
‘Ah, me!’ said the cat, ‘how can one be in good spirits when one’s
life is in danger? Because I am beginnin g to grow old, and had rather
lie at my ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my
mistress laid hold of me, and was going  to drown me; and though I
have been  lucky enough to get away from her, I do not know what I
am to live upon.’  ‘Oh,’  said the ass, ‘by all means go with us to the
great city; you are a good night singer , and may make your fortune as
a musician.’  The cat was pleased with the thought, and joined the
party . Soon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a
cock perch ed upon a gate, and screamin g out with all his might and
main. ‘Bravo!’  said the ass; ‘upon my word, you make a famous
noise; pray what is all this about?’  ‘Why,’ said the cock, ‘I was just
now sayin g that we should have fine weather for our washing-day ,
and yet my mistress  and the cook don’t thank me for my pains, but
threaten to cut off my head tomorrow , and make broth of me for the
guests that are coming on Sunday!’  ‘Heaven forbid!’  said the ass,
‘come with us Master Chanticleer; it will be better , at any rate, than
staying here to have your head cut off! Besides, who knows?","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"If we
care to sing in tune, we may get up some kind of a concert; so come
along with us.’ ‘With all my heart,’  said the cock: so they all four
went on jollily together .","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"They could not, however , reach the great city the first day; so
when night came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the
dog laid themselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up
into the branches; while the cock, think ing that the higher he sat the
safer he should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then,6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 15/201according to his custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all
sides of him to see that everything was well. In doing this, he saw
afar off something bright and shining and calling to his companions
said, ‘There must be a house no great way off, for I see a light.’  ‘If
that be the case,’  said the ass, ‘we had better change our quarters, for
our lodgin g is not the best in the world!’  ‘Besides,’  added the dog, ‘I
should not be the worse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.’  So they
walked off together towards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the
light, and as they drew near it became larger and brighter , till they at
last came close to a house in which a gang of robbers lived. The ass, being the tallest of the company , marched up to the
window and peeped  in. ‘Well, Donkey ,’ said Chanticleer , ‘what do
you see?’ ‘What do I see?’  replied the ass. ‘Why , I see a table spread
with all kinds of good things, and robbers sitting round it making
merry .’ ‘That would  be a noble lodging for us,’ said the cock. ‘Yes,’
said the ass, ‘if we could only get in’; so they consulted together how
they should contrive to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a
plan. The ass placed himself upright on his hind legs, with his
forefeet resting against the window; the dog got upon his back; the
cat scramb led up to the dog’s shoulders,  and the cock flew up and sat
upon the cat’s head. When all was ready a signal was given, and they
began their music. The ass brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed,
and the cock scream ed; and then they all broke through the window
at once, and came tumbling into the room, amongst the broken glass,
with a most hideous clatter! The robbers, who had been not a little
frightened by the opening concert, had now no doubt that some
frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them, and scampered away
as fast as they could. The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched
what the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not
expected to eat again for a month.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"As soon as they had satisfied
themselves, they put out the lights, and each once more sought out a
resting-place to his own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon
a heap of straw in the yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat
behind the door, the cat rolled herself up on the hearth before the
warm ashes, and the cock perched upon a beam on the top of the
house; and, as they were all rather tired with their journey , they soon
fell asleep. But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights
were out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had
been in too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was
bolder than the rest, went to see what was going on. Finding
everything still, he marched into the kitchen, and groped about till he
found a match in order to light a candle; and then, espying the
glittering fiery eyes of the cat, he mistook them for live coals, and
held the match to them to light it. But the cat, not understanding this
joke, sprang at his face, and spat, and scratched at him. This
frightened him dreadfully , and away he ran to the back door; but
there the dog jumped up and bit him in the leg; and as he was
crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the cock, who had
been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At this the
robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the
captain how a horri d witch had got into the house, and had spat at6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

with a knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and
stabbed him in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and
struck him with a club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the
house and cried out, ‘Throw the rascal up here!’  After this the
robbers never dared  to go back to the house; but the musicians were
so pleased with their quarters that they took up their abode there; and
there they are, I dare say , at this very day .6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

A shepher d had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very
old, and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and
his wife were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I
will shoot old Sulta n tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’
But his wife said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has
served us well a great many years, and we ought to give him a
livelihood for the rest of his days.’  ‘But what can we do with him?’
said the shepherd, ‘he has not a tooth in his head, and the thieves
don’t care for him at all; to be sure he has served us, but then he did
it to earn his liveliho od; tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon
it.’
Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the
shepherd and his wife said to one another , and was very much
frightened to think tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening
he went to his good friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told
him all his sorrows , and how his master meant to kill him in the
morning.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"‘Make yourself easy,’ said the wolf, ‘I will give you some
good advice. Your master, you know , goes out every morning very
early with his wife into the field; and they take their little child with
them, and lay it down behind the hedge in the shade while they are at
work. Now  do you lie down close by the child, and pretend to be
watching it, and I will come out of the wood and run away with it;
you must run after me as fast as you can, and I will let it drop; then
you may carry it back, and they will think you have saved their child,
and will be so thank ful to you that they will take care of you as long
as you live.’  The dog liked this plan very well; and accordingly so it
was managed. The wolf ran with the child a little way; the shepherd
and his wife screame d out; but Sultan soon overtook him, and carried
the poor little thing back to his master and mistress. Then the
shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ‘Old Sultan has saved our
child from  the wolf, and therefore he shall live and be well taken
care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and give him a good
dinner , and let him have my old cushio n to sleep on as long as he
lives.’  So from this time forward Sulta n had all that he could wish
for. Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said,
‘Now , my good fellow , you must tell no tales, but turn your head the
other way when I want to taste one of the old shepherd’ s fine fat
sheep.’  ‘No,’ said the Sultan; ‘I will be true to my master .’ However ,
the wolf thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty
morsel. But Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so
he laid wait for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was
busy looking out for a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid
about his back, that combed his locks for him finely . Then the wolf was very angry , and called Sultan ‘an old rogue,’
and swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

matter . Now Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the
shepherd’ s old three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the
poor thing limped along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail
straight in the air . The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when
they espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail
standing straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for
Sultan to fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was
picking up a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like
this way of fighting , and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the
wolf jumped up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and
looked about and wondered that no one was there. The boar,
however , had not quite hidden himself, for his ears stuck out of the
bush; and when he shook one of them a little, the cat, seeing
something move, and thinking it was a mouse, sprang upon it, and
bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped up and grunted, and ran
away , roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there sits the one who is to
blame.’  So they looked up, and espied the wolf sitting amongst the
branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal, and would not
suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of himself, and
had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

BEAN
In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a
dish of beans and wanted to cook them . So she made a fire on her
hearth, and that it might burn the quicker , she lighted it with a
handful of straw .","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"When she was emptyin g the beans into the pan, one
dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a
straw , and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to
the two. Then the straw began and said:  ‘Dear friends, from whence
do you come here?’  The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the
fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have
been certain,—I should have been burnt to ashes.’  The bean said: ‘I
too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me
into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy ,
like my comrades.’  ‘And would a better  fate have fallen to my lot?’
said the straw . ‘The old woman has destroyed all my brethren in fire
and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once, and took their lives. I
luckily slipped through her fingers.’
‘But what are we to do now?’  said the coal. ‘I think,’  answered  the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately
escaped death, we should keep togethe r like good companions, and
lest a new mischance should overtake us here, we should go away
together , and repair to a foreign country .’
The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their
way together . Soon, however , they came to a little brook, and as
there was no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were
to get over it. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay
myself straight across, and then you can walk over on me as on a
bridge.’  The straw therefore stretched itself from one bank to the
other , and the coal, who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped
quite boldly on to the newly-built bridge. But when she had reached
the middle , and heard the water rushin g beneath her, she was after
all, afraid, and stood still, and ventured no farther . The straw ,
however , began to burn, broke in two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed when she got into the water , and
breathed her last. The bean, who had prudently stayed behind on the
shore, could not but laugh at the event, was unable to stop, and
laughed so heartily that she burst. It would have been all over with
her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who was travelling in
search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook. As he had a
compassionate heart  he pulled out his needle and thread, and sewed
her togeth er. The bean thanked him most prettily , but as the tailor
used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

A king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great
way off, where there were in those days fairies. Now this king and
queen had plenty of money , and plenty  of fine clothes to wear , and
plenty of good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in
every day: but though they had been married many years they had no
children, and this grieved them very much indeed. But one day as the
queen was walking by the side of the river, at the bottom of the
garden, she saw a poor little fish, that had thrown itself out of the
water , and lay gasping and nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen
took pity on the little fish, and threw it back again into the river; and
before it swam away it lifted its head out of the water and said, ‘I
know what your wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your
kindness to me—you will soon have a daughter .’ What the little fish
had foretold soon came to pass; and the queen had a little girl, so
very beaut iful that the king could not cease looking on it for joy, and
said he would hold a great feast and make merry , and show the child
to all the land. So he asked his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and
neighbours. But the queen said, ‘I will have the fairies also, that they
might be kind and good to our little daughter .’ Now there were
thirteen fairies in the kingdom; but as the king and queen had only
twelve golden dishes for them to eat out of, they were forced to leave
one of the fairies without asking her. So twelve fairies came, each
with a high red cap on her head, and red shoes with high heels on her
feet, and a long white wand in her hand: and after the feast was over
they gathered round in a ring and gave all their best gifts to the little
princess. One gave her goodness, another beauty , another riches, and
so on till she had all that was good in the world. Just as eleven of them had done blessi ng her, a great noise was
heard in the courtya rd, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy
was come,  with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet,
and a broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the
dining-hall. Now , as she had not been asked to the feast she was very
angry , and scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to
take her revenge. So she cried out, ‘The king’ s daughter shall, in her
fifteenth year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.’  Then
the twelfth of the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift,
came forw ard, and said that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that
she could  soften its mischief; so her gift was, that the king’ s
daughter , when the spindle wounded her, should not really die, but
should only fall asleep for a hundred years. However , the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether
from the threatened  evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the
kingdom should be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first
eleven fairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so
beautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who
knew her loved her .6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

king and queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the
palace. So she roved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms
and chambers, till at last she came to an old tower , to which there
was a narrow stairca se ending with a little door. In the door there was
a golden key, and when she turned it the door sprang open, and there
sat an old lady spinning away very busily . ‘Why , how now, good
mother ,’ said the princess; ‘what are you doing there?’  ‘Spinning,’
said the old lady, and nodded her head, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. ‘How prettily that little thing turns round!’  said the
princess, and took the spindle and began to try and spin. But scarcely
had she touched it, before the fairy’ s prophecy was fulfilled; the
spindle wounded her , and she fell down lifeless on the ground. However , she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep;
and the king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their
court, fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs
in the court, the pigeons on the house- top, and the very flies slept
upon the walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went
to sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a
goose upon it for the king’ s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was
at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box
on the ear for somet hing he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell
asleep; the butler , who was slyly tasting  the ale, fell asleep with the
jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly . A large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every
year it became higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was
surrounded and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys
could be seen. But there went a report through all the land of the
beautiful sleeping Briar Rose (for so the king’ s daughter was called):
so that, from time to time, several kings’  sons came, and tried to
break through the thicket into the palace. This, however , none of
them could ever do; for the thorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it
were with hands; and there they stuck fast, and died wretchedly . After many, many years there came a king’ s son into that land: and
an old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a
beautiful palace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess,
called Briar Rose, lay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too,
how he had heard from his grandfather that many , many princes had
come, and had tried to break through the thicket, but that they had all
stuck fast in it, and died. Then the young prince said, ‘All this shall
not frighten me; I will go and see this Briar Rose.’  The old man tried
to hinder him, but he was bent upon going. Now that very day the hundred years  were ended; and as the
prince came to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering
shrubs, through which he went with ease, and they shut in after him
as thick as ever. Then he came at last to the palace, and there in the
court lay the dogs asleep; and the horses  were standing in the stables;
and on the roof sat the pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under
their wing s. And when he came into the palace, the flies were
sleeping on the walls; the spit was standing still; the butler had the
jug of ale at his lips, going to drink a draught; the maid sat with a

every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower , and
opened the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there
she lay, fast asleep  on a couch by the window . She looked so
beautiful that he could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down
and gave her a kiss. But the moment he kissed her she opened her
eyes and awoke, and smiled upon him; and they went out together;
and soon the king and queen also awoke , and all the court, and gazed
on each other with great wonder . And the horses shook themselves,
and the dogs jumpe d up and barked; the pigeons took their heads
from under their wings, and looked about and flew into the fields;
the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in the kitchen blazed up;
round went the jack, and round went the spit, with the goose for the
king’ s dinner upon it; the butler finished  his draught of ale; the maid
went on plucking the fowl; and the cook  gave the boy the box on his

wedding feast was given; and they lived happily together all their
lives long.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

A shepherd’ s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often
let him suffer the greatest hunger . At last he could bear it no longer;
so he took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful
mood. On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you
so sad, my friend?’  ‘Because,’  said the dog, ‘I am very very hungry ,
and have nothing to eat.’ ‘If that be all,’ answered the sparrow , ‘come
with me into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’
So on they went together into the town: and as they passed by a
butcher ’s shop, the sparrow said to the dog, ‘Stand there a little while
till I peck you down  a piece of meat.’  So the sparrow perched upon
the shelf: and having  first looked carefu lly about her to see if anyone
was watching her, she pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon
the edge of the shelf, till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it
up, and scrambled away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all
up. ‘Well,’ said the sparrow , ‘you shall have some more if you will;
so come with me to the next shop, and I will peck you down another
steak.’  When the dog had eaten this too, the sparrow said to him,
‘Well, my good friend, have you had enough now?’  ‘I have had
plenty of meat,’  answered he, ‘but I should like to have a piece of
bread to eat after it.’ ‘Come with me then,’  said the sparrow , ‘and you
shall soon have that too.’ So she took him to a baker ’s shop, and
pecked at two rolls that lay in the window , till they fell down: and as
the dog still wished for more, she took him to another shop and
pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the sparrow
asked him whether he had had enough now. ‘Yes,’ said he; ‘and now
let us take a walk a little way out of the town.’  So they both went out
upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone
far before the dog said, ‘I am very much tired—I should like to take
a nap.’ ‘Very well,’ answered the sparrow , ‘do so, and in the
meantime I will perch upon that bush.’  So the dog stretched himself
out on the road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a
carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks
of wine. The sparrow , seeing that the carter did not turn out of the
way, but would go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive
over him, called out, ‘Stop! stop! Mr Carter , or it shall be the worse
for you.’ But the carter , grumbling to himself, ‘You make it the
worse for me, indeed! what can you do?’ cracked his whip, and
drove his cart over the poor dog, so that the wheels crushed him to
death. ‘There,’  cried the sparrow , ‘thou cruel villain, thou hast killed
my friend  the dog. Now mind what I say. This deed of thine shall
cost thee all thou art worth.’  ‘Do your worst, and welcome,’  said the
brute, ‘what harm can you do me?’  and passed on. But the sparrow
crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked at the bung of one of the
casks till she loosen ed it; and then all the wine ran out, without the
carter seeing it. At last he looked round, and saw that the cart was
dripping, and the cask quite empty . ‘What an unlucky wretch I am!’
cried he. ‘Not wretc h enough yet!’ said the sparrow , as she alighted6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 24/201upon the head of one of the horses, and pecked at him till he reared
up and kicked. Whe n the carter saw this, he drew out his hatchet and
aimed a blow at the sparrow , meaning to kill her; but she flew away ,
and the blow fell upon the poor horse’ s head with such force, that he
fell down dead. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch
enough yet!’ said the sparrow . And as the carter went on with the
other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the cart, and
pecked out the bung  of the second cask, so that all the wine ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, ‘Miserable wretch that I
am!’ But the sparr ow answered, ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ and
perched on the head  of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The
carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she
flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the
spot. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ said he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’
said the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to
peck him too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking
about him, or caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow;
but killed his third horse as he done the other two. ‘Alas! miserable
wretch that I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ answered the
sparrow as she flew away; ‘now will I plague and punish thee at thy
own house.’  The carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind
him, and to go home overflowing with rage and vexation. ‘Alas!’
said he to his wife, ‘what ill luck has befallen me!—my wine is all
spilt, and my horse s all three dead.’  ‘Alas! husband,’  replied she,
‘and a wicked bird has come into the house, and has brought with her
all the birds in the world, I am sure, and they have fallen upon our
corn in the loft, and are eating it up at such a rate!’  Away ran the
husband upstairs, and saw thousands of birds sitting upon the floor
eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the midst of them. ‘Unlucky
wretch that I am!’ cried the carter; for he saw that the corn was
almost all gone. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow; ‘thy
cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!’  and away she flew . The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down
into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat
himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner . But the sparrow
sat on the outside of the window , and cried ‘Carter! thy cruelty shall
cost thee thy life!’  With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his
hatchet, and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke
the window . The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-
seat, and cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!’  Then he became
mad and blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force
that he cleft it in two: and as the sparro w flew from place to place,
the carter and his wife were so furiou s, that they broke all their
furniture, glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls,
without touching the bird at all. In the end, however , they caught her:
and the wife said, ‘Shall I kill her at once?’  ‘No,’  cried he, ‘that is
letting her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I
will eat her.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out
her neck and cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that
he could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried,
‘Wife, strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’  And the wife struck;
but she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he
fell down dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

There was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept
in twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors
were shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found
to be quite  worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and
yet nobody could find out how it happened, or where they had been. Then the king made it known to all the land, that if any person
could discover the secret, and find out where it was that the
princesses danced in the night, he shoul d have the one he liked best
for his wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried
and did not succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to
death. A king’s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the
evening was taken to the chamber next to the one where the
princesses lay in their twelve beds. There he was to sit and watch
where they went to dance; and, in order that nothing might pass
without his hearing it, the door of his chamber was left open. But the
king’ s son soon fell asleep; and when he awoke in the morning he
found that the princesses had all been dancing, for the soles of their
shoes were full of holes. The same thing happened the second and
third night : so the king ordered his head to be cut off. After him came
several others; but they had all the same luck, and all lost their lives
in the same manner .","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Now it chanced that an old soldier , who had been wounded in
battle and could fight no longer , passed through the country where
this king reigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an
old woman, who asked him where he was going. ‘I hardly know
where I am going, or what I had better do,’ said the soldier; ‘but I
think I should like very well to find out where it is that the princesses
dance, and then in time I might be a king.’  ‘Well,’ said the old dame,
‘that is no very hard task: only take care not to drink any of the wine
which one of the princesses will bring to you in the evening; and as
soon as she leaves you pretend to be fast asleep.’
Then she gave him a cloak, and said, ‘As soon as you put that on
you will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the
princesses wherever  they go.’ When the soldier heard all this good
counsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and
said he was willing to undertake the task. He was as well received as the other s had been, and the king
ordered fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came
he was led to the outer chamber . Just as he was going to lie down,
the eldest of the princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the
soldier threw it all away secretly , takin g care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself down on his bed, and in a little while began to
snore very loud as if he was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses
heard this they laughed heartily; and the eldest said, ‘This fellow too
might have done a wiser thing than lose his life in this way!’  Then6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 26/201they rose up and opened their drawers and boxes, and took out all
their fine clothes, and dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped
about as if they were eager to begin dancing. But the youngest said,
‘I don’t know how it is, while you are so happy I feel very uneasy; I
am sure some misc hance will befall us.’ ‘You simpleton,’  said the
eldest, ‘you are always afraid; have you forgotten how many kings’
sons have already watched in vain? And as for this soldier , even if I
had not given him his sleeping draught, he would have slept soundly
enough.’
When they were all ready , they went and looked at the soldier; but
he snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were
quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her
hands, and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The
soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after
another , the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to
lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak which the old woman had given
him, and followed them; but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the
gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out to her sisters, ‘All
is not right; someon e took hold of my gown.’  ‘You silly creature!’
said the eldest, ‘it is nothing but a nail in the wall.’  Then down they
all went, and at the bottom they found themselves in a most
delightful grove of trees; and the leaves were all of silver , and
glittered and sparkled beautifully . The soldier wished to take away
some token of the place; so he broke off a little branch, and there
came a loud noise from the tree. Then the youngest daughter said
again, ‘I am sure all is not right—did not you hear that noise? That
never happened before.’  But the eldest said, ‘It is only our princes,
who are shouting for joy at our approach.’
Then they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves
were of gold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all
glittering diamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and
every time there was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister
tremble with fear; but the eldest still said, it was only the princes,
who were crying for joy. So they went on till they came to a great
lake; and at the side of the lake there lay twelve little boats with
twelve handsome princes in them, who seemed to be waiting there
for the princesses. One of the princesse s went into each boat, and the soldier stepped
into the same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the
lake, the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and
the soldier said, ‘I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing
with all my might we do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite
tired: the boat seem s very heavy today .’ ‘It is only the heat of the
weather ,’ said the princess: ‘I feel it very warm too.’
On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from
which came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all
landed, and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his
princess; and the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with
them too; and when  any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by
her, he drank it all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it
was empty . At this, too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened,
but the eldest alway s silenced her. They danced on till three o’clock
in the morning, and then all their shoes  were worn out, so that they6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 27/201were obliged to leave off. The princes rowed them back again over
the lake (but this time the soldier placed himself in the boat with the
eldest princess); and on the opposite shore they took leave of each
other , the princesses promising to come again the next night. When they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the
princesses, and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly
came up very much tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they
said, ‘Now all is quite safe’; then they undressed themselves, put
away their fine clothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the
morning the soldier said nothing about what had happened, but
determined to see more of this strange adventure, and went again the
second and third night; and every thing happened just as before; the
princesses danced each time till their shoes were worn to pieces, and
then return ed home. However , on the third night the soldier carried
away one of the golden cups as a token of where he had been. As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he
was taken before the king with the three branches and the golden
cup; and the twelve  princesses stood listening behind the door to
hear what  he would say. And when the king asked him. ‘Where do
my twelve daughters dance at night?’  he answered, ‘With twelve
princes in a castle under ground.’  And then he told the king all that
had happened, and showed him the three branches and the golden
cup which  he had brought with him. Then the king called for the
princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said was true:
and when they saw that they were disco vered, and that it was of no
use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king
asked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he
answered, ‘I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.’—And
they were married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the
king’ s heir .6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty ,
close by the seaside . The fisherman used to go out all day long a-
fishing; and one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at
the sparkling waves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float
was dragg ed away deep into the wate r: and in drawing it up he
pulled out a great fish. But the fish said, ‘Pray let me live! I am not a
real fish; I am an enchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let
me go!’ ‘Oh, ho!’ said the man, ‘you need not make so many words
about the matter; I will have nothing to do with a fish that can talk:
so swim away , sir, as soon as you please!’  Then he put him back into
the water , and the fish darted straight down to the bottom, and left a
long streak of blood behind him on the wave. When the fisherman  went home to his wife in the pigsty , he told
her how he had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an
enchanted prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go
again. ‘Did not you ask it for anything? ’ said the wife, ‘we live very
wretchedly here, in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the
fish we want a snug little cottage.’
The fisher man did not much like the business: however , he went to
the seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all
yellow and green. And he stood at the water ’s edge, and said:
 ‘O man of the sea! Hearken to me! My wife Ilsabill
  Will have her own will,
  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’
Then the fish came swimming to him, and said, ‘Well, what is her
will? Wha t does your wife want?’  ‘Ah!’  said the fisherman, ‘she says
that when I had caug ht you, I ought to have asked you for something
before I let you go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty ,
and wants a snug little cottage.’  ‘Go home, then,’  said the fish; ‘she is
in the cottage already!’  So the man went home, and saw his wife
standing at the door of a nice trim little cottage. ‘Come in, come in!’
said she; ‘is not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?’  And
there was a parlour , and a bedchamber , and a kitchen; and behind the
cottage there was a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and
fruits; and there was a courtyard behind , full of ducks and chickens. ‘Ah!’  said the fisher man, ‘how happily we shall live now!’  ‘We will
try to do so, at least,’  said his wife. Everything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill
said, ‘Hus band, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage;
the courty ard and the garden are a great  deal too small; I should like
to have a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him
to give us a castle.’  ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘I don’t like to go to
him again , for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

very willingly , I know; go along and try!’
The fisher man went , but his heart was very heavy: and when he
came to the sea, it looked blue and gloomy , though it was very calm;
and he went close to the edge of the waves, and said:
 ‘O man of the sea! Hearken to me!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"My wife Ilsabill
  Will have her own will,
  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’
‘Well, what does she want now?’  said the fish. ‘Ah!’  said the man,
dolefully , ‘my wife wants to live in a stone castle.’  ‘Go home, then,’
said the fish; ‘she is standing at the gate of it already .’ So away went
the fisherman, and found his wife stand ing before the gate of a great
castle. ‘See,’ said she, ‘is not this grand?’  With that they went into
the castle together , and found a great many servants there, and the
rooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and
behind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a mile
long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the
courtyard were stables and cow-houses. ‘Well,’ said the man, ‘now
we will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of
our lives.’ ‘Perhaps we may,’ said the wife; ‘but let us sleep upon it,
before we make up our minds to that.’  So they went to bed. The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad
daylight, and she jogged the fisherman with her elbow , and said, ‘Get
up, husband, and bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.’
‘Wife, wife,’  said the man, ‘why shoul d we wish to be the king? I
will not be king.’  ‘Then I will,’  said she. ‘But, wife,’  said the
fisherman, ‘how can you be king—the fish cannot make you a king?’
‘Husband,’  said she, ‘say no more abou t it, but go and try! I will be
king.’  So the man went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife
should want to be king. This time the sea looked a dark grey colour ,
and was overspread with curling waves and the ridges of foam as he
cried out:
 ‘O man of the sea! Hearken to me! My wife Ilsabill
  Will have her own will,
  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’
‘Well, what would she have now?’  said the fish. ‘Alas!’  said the
poor man,  ‘my wife wants to be king.’  ‘Go home,’  said the fish; ‘she
is king already .’
Then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace
he saw a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and
trumpets. And when he went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of
gold and diamonds, with a golden crown  upon her head; and on each
side of her stood six fair maidens, each a head taller than the other . ‘Well, wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘are you king?’  ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am
king.’  And when he had looked at her for a long time, he said, ‘Ah,
wife! what a fine thing it is to be king! Now we shall never have
anything more to wish for as long as we live.’  ‘I don’t know how that
may be,’ said she; ‘never is a long time. I am king, it is true; but I
begin to be tired of that, and I think I should like to be emperor .’6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 30/201‘Alas, wife! why should you wish to be emperor?’  said the
fisherman. ‘Husban d,’ said she, ‘go to the fish! I say I will be
emperor .’ ‘Ah, wife!’  replied the fisherman, ‘the fish cannot make an
emperor , I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for such a thing.’
‘I am king,’  said Ilsabill, ‘and you are my slave; so go at once!’
So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went
along, ‘This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will
be tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.’
He soon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and
muddy , and a mighty  whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them
about, but he went as near as he could to the water ’s brink, and said:
 ‘O man of the sea! Hearken to me! My wife Ilsabill
  Will have her own will,
  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’
‘What would she have now?’  said the fish. ‘Ah!’  said the
fisherman, ‘she wants to be emperor .’ ‘Go home,’  said the fish; ‘she
is emperor already .’
So he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife
Ilsabill sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great
crown on her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood
her guards and atten dants in a row, each one smaller than the other ,
from the tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger . And before her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the
fisherman went up to her and said, ‘Wife, are you emperor?’  ‘Yes,’
said she, ‘I am emperor .’ ‘Ah!’  said the man, as he gazed upon her,
‘what a fine thing it is to be emperor!’  ‘Husband,’  said she, ‘why
should we stop at being emperor? I will be pope next.’  ‘O wife,
wife!’  said he, ‘how can you be pope? there is but one pope at a time
in Christendom.’  ‘Husband,’  said she, ‘I will be pope this very day.’
‘But,’  replied the husband, ‘the fish cannot make you pope.’  ‘What
nonsense!’  said she; ‘if he can make an emperor , he can make a
pope: go and try him.’
So the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind
was raging and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves,
and the ships were in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of
the billows. In the middle of the heavens there was a little piece of
blue sky, but towards the south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was
rising. At this sight the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he
trembled so that his knees knocked together: but still he went down
near to the shore, and said:
 ‘O man of the sea! Hearken to me! My wife Ilsabill
  Will have her own will,
  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’
‘What does she want now?’  said the fish. ‘Ah!’  said the fisherman,
‘my wife wants to be pope.’  ‘Go home,’  said the fish; ‘she is pope
already .’
Then the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a
throne that was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on
her head, and around her stood all the pomp and power of the6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 31/201Church. And on each side of her were two rows of burning lights, of
all sizes, the greates t as large as the highest and biggest tower in the
world, and the least no larger than a small rushlight. ‘Wife,’ said the
fisherman, as he looked at all this greatness, ‘are you pope?’  ‘Yes,’
said she, ‘I am pope.’  ‘Well, wife,’  replied he, ‘it is a grand thing to
be pope; and now you must be easy, for you can be nothing greater .’
‘I will think about that,’  said the wife. Then they went to bed: but
Dame Ilsabill could not sleep all night for thinking what she should
be next. At last, as she was dropping asleep, morning broke, and the
sun rose. ‘Ha!’  thought she, as she woke up and looked at it through
the window , ‘after all I cannot prevent the sun rising.’  At this thought
she was very angry , and wakened her husband, and said, ‘Husband,
go to the fish and tell him I must be lord of the sun and moon.’  The
fisherman was half asleep, but the thought frightened him so much
that he started and fell out of bed. ‘Alas, wife!’  said he, ‘cannot you
be easy with being pope?’  ‘No,’  said she, ‘I am very uneasy as long
as the sun and moon rise without my leave. Go to the fish at once!’
Then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down
to the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very
rocks shoo k. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds,
and the lightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might
have seen in the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains
with crow ns of white foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept
towards the sea, and cried out, as well as he could:

Once in summer -time the bear and the wolf were walking in the
forest, and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said:
‘Brother wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?’  ‘That is the King of
birds,’  said the wolf, ‘before whom we must bow down.’  In reality
the bird was the willow-wren. ‘IF that’s the case,’  said the bear, ‘I
should very much like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither .’
‘That is not done quite as you seem to think,’  said the wolf; ‘you
must wait until the Queen comes,’  Soon afterwards, the Queen
arrived with some food in her beak, and the lord King came too, and
they began to feed their young ones. The bear would have liked to go
at once, but the wolf held him back by the sleeve, and said: ‘No, you
must wait until the lord and lady Queen have gone away again.’  So
they took stock of the hole where the nest lay, and trotted away . The
bear, howe ver, could  not rest until he had seen the royal palace, and
when a short time had passed, went to it again. The King and Queen
had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw five or six young ones
lying there. ‘Is that the royal palace?’  cried the bear; ‘it is a wretched
palace, and you are not King’ s children, you are disreputable
children!’  When the young wrens heard that, they were frightfully
angry , and screamed: ‘No, that we are not! Our parents are honest
people! Bear , you will have to pay for that!’
The bear and the wolf grew uneasy , and turned back and went into
their holes . The young willow-wrens, however , continued to cry and
scream, and when their parents again brought food they said: ‘We
will not so much as touch one fly’s leg, no, not if we were dying of
hunger , until you have settled whether we are respectable children or
not; the bear has been here and has insulted us!’ Then the old King
said: ‘Be easy, he shall be punished,’  and he at once flew with the
Queen to the bear’s cave, and called in: ‘Old Growler , why have you
insulted my children? You shall suffer for it—we will punish you by
a bloody war.’ Thus war was announce d to the Bear, and all four-
footed animals were summoned to take part in it, oxen, asses, cows,
deer, and every other animal the earth  contained. And the willow-
wren summoned everything which flew in the air, not only birds,
large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and flies had to come. When the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent
out spies to discover  who was the enemy’ s commander -in-chief. The
gnat, who was the most crafty , flew into the forest where the enemy
was assembled, and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the
password was to be announced. There stood the bear, and he called
the fox before him and said: ‘Fox, you are the most cunning of all
animals, you shall be general and lead us.’ ‘Good,’  said the fox, ‘but
what signal shall we agree upon?’  No one knew that, so the fox said:
‘I have a fine long bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red
feathers. When I lift my tail up quite high, all is going well, and you
must charge; but if I let it hang down, run away as fast as you can.’
When the gnat had heard that, she flew away again, and revealed6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 33/201everything, down to the minutest detai l, to the willow-wren. When
day broke , and the battle was to begin , all the four-footed animals
came running up with such a noise that the earth trembled. The
willow-wren with his army also came  flying through the air with
such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one was
uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each
other . But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to
settle beneath the fox’s tail, and sting with all his might. When the
fox felt the first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain,
but he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second
sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he
could hold out no longer , screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When the animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to
flee, each into his hole, and the birds had won the battle. Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried:
‘Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart’ s content, we have won
the battle!’  But the young wrens said: ‘We will not eat yet, the bear
must come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are
honourable children, before we will do that.’  Then the willow-wren
flew to the bear’s hole and cried: ‘Growler , you are to come to the
nest to my children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your
body shall  be broken.’  So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear,
and begge d their pardon. And now at last the young wrens were
satisfied, and sat down together and ate and drank, and made merry
till quite late into the night.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs,
and went out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came
to a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself
down to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which
was her favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the
air, and catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so
high that she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away ,
and rolled along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the
spring. The princess  looked into the spring after her ball, but it was
very deep,  so deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she
began to bewail her loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball
again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything
that I have in the world.’
Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water , and
said, ‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’  ‘Alas!’  said she, ‘what
can you do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the
spring.’  The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine
clothes; but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat
from off your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you
your ball again.’  ‘What nonsense,’  thought the princess, ‘this silly
frog is talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me,
though he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell
him he shall have what he asks.’  So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you
will bring  me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his
head down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while
he came up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the
edge of the spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she
ran to pick it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand
again, that she never  thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast
as she could. The frog called after her, ‘Stay , princess, and take me
with you as you said,’  But she did not stop to hear a word. The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner , she
heard a strange noise—tap, tap—plash, plash—as if something was
coming up the marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a
gentle knock at the door , and a little voice cried out and said:
 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here! And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’
Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw
the frog, whom she had quite forgotten . At this sight she was sadly
frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to
her seat. The king, her father , seeing that something had frightened
her, asked  her what was the matter . ‘There is a nasty frog,’  said she,
‘at the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning:
I told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 35/201never get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants
to come in.’
While she was speaking the frog knock ed again at the door, and
said:
 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here! And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’
Then the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your
word you must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog
hopped into the room, and then straight on—tap, tap—plash, plash—
from the bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the
table where the princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair ,’ said he to the
princess, ‘and let me sit next to you.’  As soon as she had done this,
the frog said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’
This she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said,
‘Now I am tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’  And
the princess, though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put
him upon the pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As
soon as it was light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out
of the house. ‘Now , then,’  thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone,
and I shall be troubled with him no more.’
But she was mistak en; for when night came again she heard the
same tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:
 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here! And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’
And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept
upon her pillow as before, till the morni ng broke. And the third night
he did the same. But when the prince ss awoke on the following
morning she was astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome
prince, gazing on her with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen,
and standing at the head of her bed. He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had
changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till
some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from
her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the
prince, ‘have broken  his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish
for but that you should go with me into my father ’s kingdom, where
I will marry you, and love you as long as you live.’
The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’
to all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight
beautiful horses, decked with plumes  of feathers and a golden
harness; and behind the coach rode the prince’ s servant, faithful
Heinrich, who had bewailed the misfortunes of his dear master
during his enchantment so long and so bitterly , that his heart had
well-nigh burst. They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight
horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’ s
kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a
great many years.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said
so much to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her,
that at length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house
together .","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"‘But we must make a provisio n for winter , or else we shall
suffer from hunger ,’ said the cat; ‘and you, little mouse, cannot
venture everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.’ The
good advice was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did
not know where to put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat
said: ‘I know no place where it will be better stored up than in the
church, for no one dares take anything away from there. We will set
it beneath the altar, and not touch it until we are really in need of it.’
So the pot was placed in safety , but it was not long before the cat had
a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse: ‘I want to tell you
something, little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the
world, and has asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown
spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the christening. Let me
go out today , and you look after the house by yourself.’  ‘Yes, yes,’
answered the mouse, ‘by all means go, and if you get anything very
good to eat, think of me. I should like a drop of sweet red christening
wine myself.’  All this, however , was untrue; the cat had no cousin,
and had not been asked to be godmother . She went straight to the
church, stole to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked the top of
the fat off. Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town, looked
out for opportunities , and then stretched  herself in the sun, and licked
her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not until it was
evening did she return home. ‘Well, here you are again,’  said the
mouse, ‘no doubt you have had a merry day.’ ‘All went off well,’
answered the cat. ‘What name did they give the child?’  ‘Top off!’
said the cat quite coolly . ‘Top off!’ cried the mouse, ‘that is a very
odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in your family?’  ‘What
does that matter ,’ said the cat, ‘it is no worse than Crumb-stealer , as
your godchildren are called.’
Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said
to the mouse: ‘You must do me a favour , and once more manage the
house for a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother , and, as the
child has a white ring round its neck,  I cannot refuse.’  The good
mouse consented, but the cat crept behind the town walls to the
church, and devoured half the pot of fat. ‘Nothing ever seems so
good as what one keeps to oneself,’  said she, and was quite satisfied
with her day’s work . When she went home the mouse inquired: ‘And
what was the child christened?’  ‘Half-done,’  answered the cat. ‘Half-
done! What are you saying? I never heard the name in my life, I’ll
wager anything it is not in the calendar!’
The cat’s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. ‘All
good things go in threes,’  said she, ‘I am asked to stand godmother
again. The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that
exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

off! Half-d one!’  answered the mouse, ‘they are such odd names, they
make me very thoughtful.’  ‘You sit at home,’  said the cat, ‘in your
dark-grey fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s
because you do not go out in the daytim e.’ During the cat’s absence
the mouse cleaned the house, and put it in order , but the greedy cat
entirely emptied the pot of fat. ‘When everything is eaten up one has
some peace,’  said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not
return home till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been
given to the third child. ‘It will not please you more than the others,’
said the cat. ‘He is called All-gone.’  ‘All-gone,’  cried the mouse ‘that
is the most suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"All-
gone; what can that mean?’  and she shook her head, curled herself
up, and lay down to sleep. From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother , but
when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be
found outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said:
‘Come, cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for
ourselves—we shall enjoy that.’  ‘Yes,’ answered the cat, ‘you will
enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of
yours out of the window.’ They set out on their way, but when they
arrived, the pot of fat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty . ‘Alas!’  said the mouse, ‘now I see what has happened, now it comes
to light! You are a true friend! You have  devoured all when you were
standing godmother . First top off, then half-done, then—’  ‘Will you
hold your tongue,’  cried the cat, ‘one word more, and I will eat you
too.’ ‘All-gone’  was already on the poor mouse’ s lips; scarcely had
she spoken it before  the cat sprang on her, seized her, and swallowed
her down. Verily, that is the way of the world.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

The king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of
their only child. This child was a daugh ter, who was very beautiful;
and her mother loved her dearly , and was very kind to her. And there
was a good fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her
mother to watch over her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a
prince who lived a great way off; and as the time drew near for her to
be married, she got ready to set off on her journey to his country . Then the queen her mother , packed up a great many costly things;
jewels, and gold, and silver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short
everything that became a royal bride. And she gave her a waiting-
maid to ride with her, and give her into the bridegroom’ s hands; and
each had a horse for the journey . Now the princess’ s horse was the
fairy’ s gift, and it was called Falada, and could speak. When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her
bed-chamber , and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair,
and gave it to the princess, and said, ‘Take care of it, dear child; for it
is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.’  Then they all took
a sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into her
bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her
bridegroom’ s kingdom. One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began
to feel very thirsty:  and she said to her maid, ‘Pray get down, and
fetch me some wate r in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I
want to drink.’  ‘Nay,’ said the maid, ‘if you are thirsty , get off
yourself, and stoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your
waiting-maid any longer .’ Then she was so thirsty that she got down,
and knelt over the little brook, and drank ; for she was frightened, and
dared not bring out her golden cup; and she wept and said, ‘Alas! what will become of me?’  And the lock answered her , and said:
 ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’
But the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to
her maid’ s ill behaviour , but got upon her horse again. Then all rode farther on their journey , till the day grew so warm,
and the sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty
again; and at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid’ s
rude speec h, and said, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some water to
drink in my golden cup.’  But the maid answered her, and even spoke
more haughtily than before: ‘Drink if you will, but I shall not be your
waiting-maid.’  Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her
horse, and lay down, and held her head over the running stream, and
cried and said, ‘What will become of me?’  And the lock of hair
answered her again:
 ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 39/201And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her
bosom, and floated away with the water . Now she was so frightened
that she did not see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she
knew the charm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her
power , now that she had lost the hair. So when the bride had done
drinking, and would have got upon Falada again, the maid said, ‘I
shall ride upon Falada, and you may have my horse instead’; so she
was forced to give up her horse, and soon afterwards to take off her
royal clothes and put on her maid’ s shabby ones. At last, as they drew near the end of their journey , this treacherous
servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what
had happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well. Then the waiting-m aid got upon Falad a, and the real bride rode
upon the other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they
came to the royal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the
prince flew to meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse,
thinking she was the one who was to be his wife; and she was led
upstairs to the royal chamber; but the true princess was told to stay in
the court below . Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so
he amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window , looking at what
was going on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very
pretty , and too delicate for a waiting-ma id, he went up into the royal
chamber to ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that
was thus left standing in the court below . ‘I brought her with me for
the sake of her company on the road,’  said she; ‘pray give the girl
some work to do, that she may not be idle.’  The old king could not
for some time think of any work for her to do; but at last he said, ‘I
have a lad who takes care of my geese; she may go and help him.’
Now the name of this lad, that the real bride was to help in watching
the king’ s geese, was Curdken. But the false bride said to the prince, ‘Dear husband, pray do me
one piece of kindnes s.’ ‘That I will,’  said the prince. ‘Then tell one of
your slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it
was very unruly , and plagued me sadly  on the road’; but the truth
was, she was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other
speak, and tell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point,
and the faithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard
of it, she wept, and begged the man to nail up Falada’ s head against a
large dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every
morning and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the slaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the
head, and nailed it up under the dark gate. Early the next morn ing, as she and Curdken went out through the
gate, she said sorrowfully:
 ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’
and the head answered:
 ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest! Alas!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

she came to the meadow , she sat down upon a bank there, and let
down her waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and
when Curdken saw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have
pulled some of the locks out, but she cried:
 ‘Blow, breezes, blow! Let Curdken’s hat go! Blow, breezes, blow!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Let him after it go! O’er hills, dales, and rocks,

  Are all comb’d and curl’d! Then there  came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken’ s hat;
and away it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run
after it; till, by the time he came back,  she had done combing and
curling her hair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry
and sulky , and would not speak to her at all; but they watched the
geese until it grew  dark in the evening, and then drove them
homewards. The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the
poor girl looked up at Falada’ s head, and cried:
 ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’
and the head answered:
 ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest! Alas!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"alas! if thy mother knew it,

Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow ,
and began  to comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her,
and wanted to take hold of it; but she cried out quickly:

way, over the hills and far away , so that he had to run after it; and
when he came back  she had bound up her hair again, and all was
safe. So they watched the geese till it grew dark. In the evening, after they came home,  Curdken went to the old
king, and said, ‘I cannot have that strang e girl to help me to keep the
geese any longer .’ ‘Why?’  said the king. ‘Because, instead of doing
any good, she does nothing but tease me all day long.’  Then the king
made him tell him what had happened. And Curdken said, ‘When we
go in the morning through the dark gate with our flock of geese, she
cries and talks with the head of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and
says:

"alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’
And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon
the meadow where the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and
how he was forced to run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to
themselves. But the old king told the boy to go out again the next
day: and when morning came, he placed himself behind the dark
gate, and heard how she spoke to Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and hid himself in a bush by the
meadow’ s side; and he soon saw with his own eyes how they drove
the flock of geese; and how, after a little time, she let down her hair
that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her say:
 ‘Blow, breezes, blow! Let Curdken’s hat go! Blow, breezes, blow!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Let him after it go! O’er hills, dales, and rocks,

  Are all comb’d and curl’d! And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken’ s hat,
and away went Curd ken after it, while the girl went on combing and
curling her hair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without
being seen; and when the little goose-girl came back in the evening
he called her aside, and asked her why she did so: but she burst into
tears, and said, ‘Tha t I must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose
my life.’
But the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had
told him all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it
was very lucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the
king ordered royal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with
wonder , she was so beautiful. Then he called his son and told him
that he had only a false bride; for that she was merely a waiting-
maid, while the true bride stood by. And the young king rejoiced
when he saw her beauty, and heard how meek and patient she had
been; and without saying anything to the false bride, the king ordered
a great feast to be got ready for all his court. The bridegroom sat at
the top, with the false princess on one side, and the true one on the
other; but nobody knew her again, for her beauty was quite dazzling
to their eyes; and she did not seem at all like the little goose-girl,
now that she had her brilliant dress on. When they had eaten and drank, and were very merry , the old king
said he would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of
the princess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the
true waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who
would behave thus. ‘Nothing better ,’ said this false bride, ‘than that
she should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and
that two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from
street to street till she was dead.’  ‘Thou art she!’  said the old king;
‘and as thou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.’  And the
young king was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over
the kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy
came to see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

AND P ARTLET
1. HOW  THEY  WENT  TO THE MOUNT AINS TO EA T NUTS
‘The nuts are quite ripe now,’ said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet,
‘suppose we go together to the mounta ins, and eat as many as we
can, before the squir rel takes them all away .’ ‘With all my heart,’  said
Partlet, ‘let us go and make a holiday of it together .’
So they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they
stayed there till the evening.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Now , whether it was that they had eaten
so many nuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and
would not, I do not know: however , they took it into their heads that
it did not become them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to
build a little carriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet
jumped into it and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to
it and draw her home. ‘That’ s a good joke!’  said Chanticleer; ‘no,
that will never do; I had rather by half walk home; I’ll sit on the box
and be coachman, if you like, but I’ll not draw .’ While this was
passing, a duck came quacking up and cried out, ‘You thieving
vagabonds, what business have you in my grounds? I’ll give it you
well for your insolence!’  and upon that she fell upon Chanticleer
most lustily . But Chanticleer was no coward, and returned the duck’ s
blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely that she soon began to cry out
for mercy; which was only granted her upon condition that she
would draw the carriage home for them. This she agreed to do; and
Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, ‘Now , duck, get on
as fast as you can.’  And away they went at a pretty good pace. After they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a
pin walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, ‘Stop,
stop!’  and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way,
and such dirty walki ng they could not get on at all: he told them that
he and his friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off,
and had sat drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he
begged therefore that the travellers would be so kind as to give them
a lift in their carriag e. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin
fellows, and not likely to take up much room, told them they might
ride, but made them  promise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in
getting in, nor to tread on Partlet’ s toes. Late at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in
the dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good
deal from one side to the other , they made up their minds to fix their
quarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his
house was full, thinking they might not be very respectable
company: however , they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg
which Partlet had laid by the way, and said they would give him the
duck, who was in the habit of laying one every day: so at last he let6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

evening very jollily . Early in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody
was stirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching
the egg, they pecked  a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into
the firepla ce: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast
asleep, and seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord’ s
easy chair and the other into his handke rchief; and, having done this,
they crept  away as softly as possible. However , the duck, who slept
in the open air in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the
brook which ran close by the inn, soon swam out of their reach. An hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his
handkerchief to wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked
him: then he walked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but
when he stirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost
blinded him. ‘Bless  me!’ said he, ‘all the world seems to have a
design against my head this morning ’: and so saying, he threw
himself sulkily into his easy chair; but, oh dear!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"the needle ran into
him; and this time the pain was not in his head. He now flew into a
very great passion, and, suspecting the company who had come in
the night before, he went to look after them, but they were all off; so
he swore that he never again would take in such a troop of
vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no reckoning, and gave him
nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"2. HOW  CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET  WENT  TO VISIT  MR
KORBES
Another day, Chant icleer and Partlet wished to ride out together;
so Chantic leer built a handsome carriag e with four red wheels, and
harnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage,
and away they drove. Soon afterwards  a cat met them, and said,
‘Where are you going?’  And Chanticleer replied,
 ‘All on our way
  A visit to pay
  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’
Then the cat said, ‘Take me with you,’  Chanticleer said, ‘With all
my heart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall of f.’
 ‘Take care of this handsome coach of mine,
  Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine! Now, mice, be ready,
  And, wheels, run steady! For we are going a visit to pay
  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’
Soon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and
Chanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with
them. When they arrived at Mr Korbes’ s house, he was not at home; so
the mice drew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and
Partlet flew upon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck
got into the washin g cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed
pillow , the millstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg
rolled himself up in the towel.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

fire; but the cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the
kitchen to wash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in
his face; and when he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces
in the towel all over his face and eyes. Then he was very angry , and
went without his supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the
pillow , the pin ran into his cheek: at this he became quite furious,
and, jump ing up, would have run out of the house; but when he came
to the door, the millstone fell down on his head, and killed him on
the spot.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"3. HOW  PARTLET  DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW
CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF
Another day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the
mountains to eat nuts; and it was settled  that all the nuts which they
found should be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a
very large nut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer , and kept
it all to herself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it,
and it stuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried
out to Chanticleer , ‘Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some
water , or I shall be choked.’  Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the
river, and said, ‘River , give me some water , for Partlet lies in the
mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ The river said, ‘Run
first to the bride, and ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water .’
Chanticleer ran to the bride, and said, ‘Bride, you must give me a
silken cord, for then the river will give me water , and the water I will
carry to Partlet, who lies on the mountain, and will be choked by a
great nut.’ But the bride said, ‘Run first, and bring me my garland
that is hanging on a willow in the garden.’  Then Chanticleer ran to
the garden, and took the garland from the bough where it hung, and
brought it to the bride; and then the bride gave him the silken cord,
and he took the silken cord to the river, and the river gave him water ,
and he carried the water to Partlet; but in the meantime she was
choked by the great nut, and lay quite dead, and never moved any
more. Then Chanticleer was very sorry , and cried bitterly; and all the
beasts came and wept with him over poor Partlet.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"And six mice built
a little hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they
harnessed themselve s before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the
way they met the fox. ‘Where are you going, Chanticleer?’  said he. ‘To bury my Partlet,’  said the other . ‘May I go with you?’  said the
fox. ‘Yes; but you must get up behind, or my horses will not be able
to draw you.’ Then the fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the
bear, the goat, and all the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon
the hearse. So on they went till they came to a rapid stream. ‘How shall we
get over?’  said Chanticleer . Then said a straw , ‘I will lay myself
across, and you may pass over upon me.’ But as the mice were going
over, the straw slipp ed away and fell into the water , and the six mice
all fell in and were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log
of wood came and said, ‘I am big enough; I will lay myself across
the stream , and you shall pass over upon me.’ So he laid himself
down; but they managed so clumsily , that the log of wood fell in and
was carried away by the stream. Then a stone, who saw what had6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

laying himself across the stream; and this time he got safely to the
other side with the hearse, and managed to get Partlet out of it; but
the fox and the other mourners, who were sitting behind, were too
heavy , and fell back  into the water and were all carried away by the
stream and drowned. Thus Chan ticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having
dug a grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over
her. Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at
last he died too; and so all were dead.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished
for a child . At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant
her desire. These people had a little window at the back of their
house from  which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of
the most beautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however , surrounded by
a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an
enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down
into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the
most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green
that she longed for it, she quite pined away , and began to look pale
and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and asked: ‘What ails
you, dear wife?’  ‘Ah,’ she replied, ‘if I can’t eat some of the
rampion, which is in the garden behind  our house, I shall die.’ The
man, who loved her, thought: ‘Sooner than let your wife die, bring
her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.’  At twilight,
he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress,
hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife. She at
once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily . It tasted so good
to her—so very good, that the next day she longed for it three times
as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband must once
more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening therefore, he
let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he
was terribly afraid, for he saw the ench antress standing before him. ‘How can you dare,’ said she with angry look, ‘descend into my
garden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!’
‘Ah,’  answered he, ‘let mercy take the place of justice, I only made
up my mind to do it out of necessity . My wife saw your rampion
from the window , and felt such a longing for it that she would have
died if she had not got some to eat.’ Then the enchantress allowed
her anger to be softened, and said to him: ‘If the case be as you say, I
will allow  you to take away with you as much rampion as you will,
only I make one condition, you must give me the child which your
wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care
for it like a mother .’ The man in his terror consented to everything,
and when the woma n was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared
at once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with
her. Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When
she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower ,
which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the
top was a little wind ow. When the ench antress wanted to go in, she
placed herself beneath it and cried:
 ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
  Let down your hair to me.’6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 47/201Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when
she heard the voice  of the enchantress she unfastened her braided
tresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above,
and then the hair fell twenty ells down,  and the enchantress climbed
up by it. After a year or two, it came to pass that the king’ s son rode
through the forest and passed by the tower . Then he heard a song,
which was so charm ing that he stood still and listened. This was
Rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet
voice resound. The king’ s son wanted to climb up to her, and looked
for the door of the tower , but none was to be found. He rode home,
but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he
went out into the forest and listened to it. Once when he was thus
standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he
heard how she cried:
 ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
  Let down your hair to me.’
Then Rapu nzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress
climbed up to her. ‘If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too
will try my fortune,’  said he, and the next day when it began to grow
dark, he went to the tower and cried:
 ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
  Let down your hair to me.’
Immediately the hair fell down and the king’ s son climbed up. At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her
eyes had never yet beheld, came to her; but the king’ s son began to
talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so
stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see
her. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would
take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and
handsome, she thought: ‘He will love me more than old Dame
Gothel does’; and she said yes, and laid her hand in his. She said: ‘I
will willin gly go away with you, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you come, and I will
weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and
you will take me on your horse.’  They agreed that until that time he
should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said
to her: ‘Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are so much
heavier for me to draw up than the young king’ s son—he is with me
in a mome nt.’ ‘Ah! you wicked child,’  cried the enchantress. ‘What
do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all the world,
and yet you have deceived me!’ In her anger she clutched Rapunzel’ s
beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a
pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and
the lovely  braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless that she
took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief
and misery . On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however , the
enchantress fastened  the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the
hook of the window , and when the king’ s son came and cried:6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

she let the hair down. The king’ s son ascended, but instead of
finding his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at
him with wicked and venomous looks. ‘Aha!’  she cried mockingly ,
‘you would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer
singing in the nest; the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes
as well. Rapunzel is lost to you; you will never see her again.’  The
king’ s son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt
down from  the tower . He escaped with his life, but the thorns into
which he fell pierce d his eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about
the forest,  ate nothing but roots and berries, and did naught but
lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife. Thus he roamed
about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert
where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy
and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a voice, and it seemed so
familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached,
Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as
he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were
there. He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at
the top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen
asleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in
her arms, had flown  down, snatched it away , and set it on the high
tree. The forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to
himself: ‘You will take him home with you, and bring him up with
your Lina. ’ He took it home, therefore, and the two children grew up
together . And the one, which he had found on a tree was called
Fundevogel, because  a bird had carried it away . Fundevogel and Lina
loved each other so dearly that when they did not see each other they
were sad. Now the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails
and began to fetch water , and did not go once only, but many times,
out to the spring. Lina saw this and said, ‘Listen, old Sanna, why are
you fetchi ng so much water?’  ‘If you will never repeat it to anyone, I
will tell you why.’ So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to
anyone, and then the cook said: ‘Early tomorrow morning, when the
forester is out huntin g, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in
the kettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.’
Early next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and
when he was gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to
Fundevogel: ‘If you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.’
Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.’  Then said
Lina: ‘The n will I tell you. Last night,  old Sanna carried so many
buckets of water into the house that I asked her why she was doing
that, and she said that if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she
said that early tomo rrow morning when father was out hunting, she
would set the kettle full of water , throw  you into it and boil you; but
we will get up quickly , dress ourselves, and go away together .’
The two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly , and
went away . When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went
into the bedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But
when she came in, and went to the beds, both the children were gone. Then she was terribly alarmed, and she said to herself: ‘What shall I
say now when the forester comes home and sees that the children are
gone? They must be followed instantly to get them back again.’
Then the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and
overtake the children. The children, however , were sitting outside the
forest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina
said to Fundevogel: ‘Never leave me, and I will never leave you.’
Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’ Then said Lina: ‘Do you
become a rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.’ When the three servants
came to the forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

to be done here,’  and they went home and told the cook that they had
seen nothi ng in the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it. Then the old cook scolded and said: ‘You simpletons, you should
have cut the rose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and
brought it home with you; go, and do it at once.’  They had therefore
to go out and look for the second time. The children, however , saw
them coming from a distance. Then Lina said: ‘Fundevogel, never
leave me, and I will never leave you.’  Fundevogel said: ‘Neither
now; nor ever.’ Said Lina: ‘Then do you become a church, and I’ll be
the chandelier in it.’ So when the three servants came, nothing was
there but a church, with a chandelier in it. They said therefore to each
other: ‘What can we do here, let us go home.’  When they got home,
the cook asked if they had not found them; so they said no, they had
found nothing but a church, and there was a chandelier in it. And the
cook scold ed them and said: ‘You fools! why did you not pull the
church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home with you?’  And now
the old cook herself got on her legs, and went with the three servants
in pursuit of the children. The children, however , saw from afar that
the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling after them. Then said Lina: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave
you.’  Then  said Fundevogel: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’ Said Lina: ‘Be
a fishpond , and I will be the duck upon it.’ The cook, however , came
up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it, and was
about to drink it up. But the duck swam quickly to her, seized her
head in its beak and drew her into the water , and there the old witch
had to drown. Then the children went home together , and were
heartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

One summer ’s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the
window; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. Then
came a peasant wom an down the street  crying: ‘Good jams, cheap! Good jams, cheap!’  This rang pleasantly in the tailor ’s ears; he
stretched his delicat e head out of the window , and called: ‘Come up
here, dear woman; here you will get rid of your goods.’  The woman
came up the three steps to the tailor with her heavy basket, and he
made her unpack all the pots for him. He inspected each one, lifted it
up, put his nose to it, and at length said: ‘The jam seems to me to be
good, so weigh me out four ounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter
of a pound that is of no consequence.’  The woman who had hoped to
find a good sale, gave him what he desired, but went away quite
angry and grumbling. ‘Now , this jam shall be blessed by God,’  cried
the little tailor , ‘and give me health and strength’; so he brought the
bread out of the cupboard, cut himself a piece right across the loaf
and spread the jam over it. ‘This won’ t taste bitter ,’ said he, ‘but I
will just finish the jacket before I take a bite.’  He laid the bread near
him, sewe d on, and in his joy, made bigger and bigger stitches. In the
meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to where the flies were
sitting in great numbers, and they were attracted and descended on it
in hosts. ‘Hi! who invited you?’  said the little tailor , and drove the
unbidden guests away . The flies, however , who understood no
German, would not be turned away , but came back again in ever-
increasing companies. The little tailor at last lost all patience, and
drew a piece of cloth  from the hole under his work-table, and saying:
‘Wait, and I will give it to you,’  struck it mercilessly on them. When
he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer than
seven, dead and with legs stretched out. ‘Are you a fellow of that
sort?’  said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery . ‘The
whole town shall know of this!’  And the little tailor hastened to cut
himself a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters:
‘Seven at one strok e!’ ‘What, the town !’ he continued, ‘the whole
world shall hear of it!’ and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb’ s
tail. The tailor put on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the
world, because he thought his workshop was too small for his valour . Before he went away , he sought about in the house to see if there was
anything which he could take with him; however , he found nothing
but an old cheese, and that he put in his pocket. In front of the door
he observed a bird which had caught itself in the thicket. It had to go
into his pocket with the cheese. Now he took to the road boldly , and
as he was light and nimble, he felt no fatigue. The road led him up a
mountain, and when he had reached the highest point of it, there sat a
powerful giant looking peacefully abou t him. The little tailor went
bravely up, spoke to him, and said: ‘Good day, comrade, so you are
sitting there overlooking the wide-spre ad world! I am just on my
way thithe r, and want to try my luck. Have you any inclination to go6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

‘You ragamuf fin! You miserable creature!’
‘Oh, indeed?’  answered the little tailor , and unbuttoned his coat,
and showed the giant the girdle, ‘there may you read what kind of a
man I am!’ The giant read: ‘Seven at one stroke,’  and thought that
they had been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a
little respe ct for the tiny fellow . Nevert heless, he wished to try him
first, and took a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that
water dropped out of it. ‘Do that likewise,’  said the giant, ‘if you
have strength.’  ‘Is that all?’ said the tailor , ‘that is child’ s play with
us!’ and put his hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and
pressed it until the liquid ran out of it. ‘Faith,’  said he, ‘that was a
little bette r, wasn’ t it?’ The giant did not know what to say, and could
not believe it of the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and
threw it so high that the eye could scarcely follow it. ‘Now , little
mite of a man, do that likewise,’  ‘Well thrown,’  said the tailor , ‘but
after all the stone came down to earth again; I will throw you one
which shall never come back at all,’ and he put his hand into his
pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air. The bird, delighted
with its liberty , rose, flew away and did not come back. ‘How does
that shot please you, comrade?’  asked the tailor . ‘You can certainly
throw ,’ said the giant, ‘but now we will see if you are able to carry
anything properly .’ He took the little tailor to a mighty oak tree
which lay there felled on the ground, and said: ‘If you are strong
enough, help me to carry the tree out of the forest.’  ‘Readily ,’
answered the little man; ‘take you the trunk on your shoulders, and I
will raise up the branches and twigs; after all, they are the heaviest.’
The giant took the trunk on his shoulder , but the tailor seated himself
on a branc h, and the giant, who could not look round, had to carry
away the whole tree, and the little tailor into the bargain: he behind,
was quite merry and happy , and whistled the song: ‘Three tailors
rode forth from the gate,’  as if carrying the tree were child’ s play. The giant,  after he had dragged the heavy burden part of the way,
could go no further , and cried: ‘Hark you, I shall have to let the tree
fall!’  The tailor sprang nimbly down, seized the tree with both arms
as if he had been carrying it, and said to the giant: ‘You are such a
great fellow , and yet cannot even carry the tree!’
They went on together , and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant
laid hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging,
bent it down, gave it into the tailor ’s hand, and bade him eat. But the
little tailor  was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant
let it go, it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air
with it. When he had fallen down again without injury , the giant said:
‘What is this? Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?’
‘There is no lack of strength,’  answered the little tailor . ‘Do you
think that could be anything to a man who has struck down seven at
one blow? I leapt over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting
down there in the thicket. Jump as I did, if you can do it.’ The giant
made the attempt but he could not get over the tree, and remained
hanging in the branches, so that in this also the tailor kept the upper
hand. The giant said: ‘If you are such a valiant fellow , come with me
into our cavern and spend the night with us.’ The little tailor was6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

giants were sitting there by the fire, and each of them had a roasted
sheep in his hand and was eating it. The little tailor looked round and
thought: ‘It is much  more spacious here than in my workshop.’  The
giant showed him a bed, and said he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however , was too big for the little tailor; he did not lie
down in it, but crept into a corner . When it was midnight, and the
giant thought that the little tailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got
up, took a great iron bar, cut through the bed with one blow , and
thought he had finished off the grasshopper for good. With the
earliest dawn the giants went into the forest, and had quite forgotten
the little tailor , when all at once he walked up to them quite merrily
and boldly . The giants were terrified, they were afraid that he would
strike them all dead, and ran away in a great hurry . The little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed
nose.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"After he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard
of a royal palace, and as he felt weary , he lay down on the grass and
fell asleep. Whilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him
on all sides, and read on his girdle: ‘Seven at one stroke.’  ‘Ah!’  said
they, ‘wha t does the great warrior want  here in the midst of peace? He must be a migh ty lord.’  They went and announced him to the
king, and gave it as their opinion that if war should break out, this
would be a weighty and useful man who ought on no account to be
allowed to depart. The counsel pleased the king, and he sent one of
his courtiers to the little tailor to offer him military service when he
awoke. The ambassador remained standing by the sleeper , waited
until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes, and then conveyed
to him this proposal. ‘For this very reason have I come here,’  the
tailor replied, ‘I am ready to enter the king’ s service.’  He was
therefore honourably received, and a special dwelling was assigned
him. The soldie rs, however , were set against the little tailor , and wished
him a thousand miles away . ‘What is to be the end of this?’  they said
among themselves. ‘If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him,
seven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against
him.’  They  came therefore to a decision,  betook themselves in a body
to the king, and begged for their dismissal. ‘We are not prepared,’
said they, ‘to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.’  The
king was sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful
servants, wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor , and would
willingly have been rid of him again. But he did not venture to give
him his dismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his
people dead, and place himself on the royal throne. He thought about
it for a long time, and at last found good counsel. He sent to the little
tailor and caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior ,
he had one request to make to him. In a forest of his country lived
two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering,
ravaging, and burning, and no one could approach them without
putting himself in danger of death. If the tailor conquered and killed
these two giants, he would give him his only daughter to wife, and
half of his kingdom  as a dowry , likewise one hundred horsemen
should go with him to assist him. ‘That would indeed be a fine thing
for a man like me!’ thought the little tailor . ‘One is not offered a
beautiful princess and half a kingdom every day of one’s life!’  ‘Oh,6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 54/201yes,’ he replied, ‘I will soon subdue the giants, and do not require the
help of the hundred horsemen to do it; he who can hit seven with one
blow has no need to be afraid of two.’
The little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed
him. Whe n he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his
followers: ‘Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the
giants.’  Then he bounded into the forest and looked about right and
left. After a while he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under
a tree, and snored so that the branches waved up and down. The little
tailor , not idle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these
climbed up the tree. When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a
branch, until he sat just above the sleepers, and then let one stone
after another fall on the breast of one of the giants. For a long time
the giant felt nothin g, but at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and
said: ‘Why  are you knocking me?’  ‘You must be dreaming,’  said the
other , ‘I am not knocking you.’  They laid themselves down to sleep
again, and then the tailor threw a stone down on the second. ‘What is
the meaning of this? ’ cried the other ‘Why are you pelting me?’  ‘I am
not pelting you,’  answered the first, growling. They disputed about it
for a time, but as they were weary they let the matter rest, and their
eyes close d once more. The little tailor began his game again, picked
out the biggest stone , and threw it with all his might on the breast of
the first giant. ‘Tha t is too bad!’  cried he, and sprang up like a
madman, and pushed his companion against the tree until it shook. The other paid him back in the same coin, and they got into such a
rage that they tore up trees and belaboured each other so long, that at
last they both fell down dead on the ground at the same time. Then
the little tailor leapt down. ‘It is a lucky thing,’  said he, ‘that they did
not tear up the tree on which I was sitting, or I should have had to
sprint on to another like a squirrel; but we tailors are nimble.’  He
drew out his sword and gave each of them a couple of thrusts in the
breast, and then went out to the horsemen and said: ‘The work is
done; I have finishe d both of them off, but it was hard work! They
tore up trees in their sore need, and defended themselves with them,
but all that is to no purpose when a man like myself comes, who can
kill seven at one blow .’ ‘But are you not wounded?’  asked the
horsemen. ‘You need not concern yours elf about that,’  answered the
tailor , ‘they have not bent one hair of mine.’  The horsemen would
not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they found the giants
swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the torn-up trees. The little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he,
however , repented of his promise, and again bethought himself how
he could get rid of the hero. ‘Before you receive my daughter , and
the half of my kingdom,’  said he to him, ‘you must perform one
more heroic deed. In the forest roams a unicorn which does great
harm, and you must catch it first.’  ‘I fear one unicorn still less than
two giants. Seven at one blow , is my kind of affair.’ He took a rope
and an axe with him, went forth into the forest, and again bade those
who were sent with him to wait outside. He had not long to seek. The
unicorn soon came towards him, and rushed directly on the tailor , as
if it would gore him with its horn without more ado. ‘Softly , softly; it
can’t be done as quickly as that,’  said he, and stood still and waited
until the animal was quite close, and then sprang nimbly behind the
tree. The unicorn ran against the tree with all its strength, and stuck6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 55/201its horn so fast in the trunk that it had not the strength enough to
draw it out again, and thus it was caught. ‘Now , I have got the bird,’
said the tailor , and came out from behind the tree and put the rope
round its neck, and then with his axe he hewed the horn out of the
tree, and when all was ready he led the beast away and took it to the
king. The king still would not give him the promised reward, and made
a third demand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a
wild boar that made great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen
should give him their help. ‘Willingly ,’ said the tailor , ‘that is child’ s
play!’  He did not take the huntsmen with him into the forest, and
they were well pleas ed that he did not, for the wild boar had several
times received them  in such a manner that they had no inclination to
lie in wait for him. When the boar perceived the tailor , it ran on him
with foaming mouth and whetted tusks,  and was about to throw him
to the ground, but the hero fled and sprang into a chapel which was
near and up to the window at once, and in one bound out again. The
boar ran after him, but the tailor ran round outside and shut the door
behind it, and then the raging beast, which was much too heavy and
awkward to leap out of the window , was caught. The little tailor
called the huntsmen thither that they might see the prisoner with
their own eyes. The hero, however , went to the king, who was now,
whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his promise, and gave his
daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he known that it was no
warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before him, it would
have gone to his heart still more than it did. The wedding was held
with great  magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a king was
made. After some time the young queen heard her husband say in his
dreams at night: ‘Boy , make me the doublet, and patch the
pantaloons, or else I will rap the yard-measure over your ears.’  Then
she discov ered in what state of life the young lord had been born,
and next morning complained of her wrongs to her father , and
begged him to help her to get rid of her husband, who was nothing
else but a tailor . The king comforted her and said: ‘Leave your
bedroom door open this night, and my servants shall stand outside,
and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind him, and take him on
board a ship which shall carry him into the wide world.’  The woman
was satisfi ed with this; but the king’ s armour -bearer , who had heard
all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of the whole
plot. ‘I’ll put a screw  into that business,’  said the little tailor . At night
he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and when she thought
that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door, and then lay
down again. The little tailor , who was only pretending to be asleep,
began to cry out in a clear voice: ‘Boy , make me the doublet and
patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your
ears. I smote seven at one blow . I killed  two giants, I brought away
one unicor n, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are
standing outside the room.’  When these men heard the tailor
speaking thus, they were overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the
wild hunts man were behind them, and none of them would venture
anything further against him. So the little tailor was and remained a
king to the end of his life.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and
his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He
had little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the
land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he
thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety ,
he groaned and said to his wife: ‘What is to become of us? How are
we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even
for ourselves?’  ‘I’ll tell you what, husb and,’  answered the woman,
‘early tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest
to where it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give
each of them one more piece of bread,  and then we will go to our
work and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again,
and we shall be rid of them.’  ‘No, wife, ’ said the man, ‘I will not do
that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?—the
wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.’  ‘O, you
fool!’  said she, ‘then  we must all four die of hunger , you may as well
plane the planks for our coffins,’  and she left him no peace until he
consented. ‘But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,’
said the man. The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger , and
had heard what their stepmother had said to their father . Gretel wept
bitter tears , and said to Hansel: ‘Now all is over with us.’ ‘Be quiet,
Gretel,’  said Hansel,  ‘do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way
to help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put
on his little coat, opened the door below , and crept outside. The
moon shone brightly , and the white pebbles which lay in front of the
house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed
the little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he
went back and said to Gretel: ‘Be comforted, dear little sister , and
sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,’ and he lay down again in his
bed. When  day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman
came and awoke the two children, saying: ‘Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the forest to fetch wood.’  She gave each a little
piece of bread, and said: ‘There is something for your dinner , but do
not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.’  Gretel took
the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they
had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the
house, and did so again and again. His father said: ‘Hansel, what are
you looking at there and staying behind for? Pay attention, and do
not forget how to use your legs.’  ‘Ah, father ,’ said Hansel, ‘I am
looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and
wants to say goodby e to me.’ The wife said: ‘Fool, that is not your
little cat, that is the morning sun which  is shining on the chimneys.’
Hansel, however , had not been looking back at the cat, but had been
constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket
on the road.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 57/201When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said:
‘Now , children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you
may not be cold.’  Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together , as
high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames
were burning very high, the woman said: ‘Now , children, lay
yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and
cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch
you away .’
Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a
little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe
they believ ed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however ,
but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind
was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting
such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast
asleep.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel
began to cry and said: ‘How are we to get out of the forest now?’  But
Hansel comforted her and said: ‘Just wait a little, until the moon has
risen, and then we will soon find the way.’ And when the full moon
had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the
pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed
them the way . They walk ed the whole night long, and by break of day came once
more to their father ’s house. They knock ed at the door, and when the
woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said:
‘You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?—
we though t you were never coming back  at all!’ The father , however ,
rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone. Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout
the land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their
father: ‘Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that
is the end. The child ren must go, we will take them farther into the
wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other
means of saving ourselves!’  The man’ s heart was heavy , and he
thought: ‘It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with
your child ren.’ The woman, however , would listen to nothing that he
had to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say
B, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a
second time also.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"The children, however , were still awake and had heard the
conversation. When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up,
and wante d to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but
the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said: ‘Do not cry,
Gretel, go to sleep quietly , the good God will help us.’
Early in the mornin g came the woman, and took the children out
of their beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still
smaller than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel
crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel
on the ground. ‘Hansel, why do you stop and look round?’  said the
father , ‘go on.’ ‘I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting
on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me,’ answered Hansel. ‘Fool!’  said the woman, ‘that is not your little pigeon, that is the6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 58/201morning sun that is shining on the chim ney.’ Hansel, however little
by little, threw all the crumbs on the path. The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they
had never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again
made, and the mother said: ‘Just sit there, you children, and when
you are tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to
cut wood,  and in the evening when we are done, we will come and
fetch you away .’ When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread
with Hans el, who had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep
and evening passed, but no one came to the poor children. They did
not awake  until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little
sister and said: ‘Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we
shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will
show us our way home again.’  When the moon came they set out, but
they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly
about in the woods and fields had picke d them all up. Hansel said to
Gretel: ‘We shall soon find the way,’ but they did not find it. They
walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till
evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry ,
for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on
the ground. And as they were so weary that their legs would carry
them no longer , they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep. It was now three mornings since they had left their father ’s house. They began to walk  again, but they always came deeper into the
forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and
weariness. When it was mid-day , they saw a beautiful snow-white
bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood
still and listened to it. And when its song was over, it spread its
wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they
reached a little hous e, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they
approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and
covered with cakes, but that the windo ws were of clear sugar . ‘We
will set to work on that,’  said Hansel, ‘and have a good meal. I will
eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some of the window , it
will taste sweet.’  Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of
the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and
nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried from the parlour:
 ‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,
  Who is nibbling at my little house?’
The children answered:
 ‘The wind, the wind,
  The heaven-born wind,’
and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who
liked the taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel
pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and
enjoyed herself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as
old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping
out. Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall
what they had in their hands. The old woman, however , nodded her
head, and said: ‘Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"No harm shall happen to you.’  She
took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. Then6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 59/201good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar ,
apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with
clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and
thought they were in heaven. The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in
reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only
built the little house  of bread in order to entice them there. When a
child fell into her power , she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was
a feast day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but
they have a keen scent like the beasts,  and are aware when human
beings draw near. When Hansel and Gretel came into her
neighbourhood, she laughed with malice, and said mockingly: ‘I
have them, they shall not escape me again!’  Early in the morning
before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she
saw both of them sleeping and looking  so pretty , with their plump
and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: ‘That will be a dainty
mouthful!’  Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried
him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to Gretel,
shook her till she awoke, and cried: ‘Get up, lazy thing, fetch some
water , and cook something good for your brother , he is in the stable
outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.’  Gretel
began to weep bitter ly, but it was all in vain, for she was forced to do
what the wicked witch commanded. And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got
nothing but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little
stable, and cried: ‘Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if
you will soon be fat.’ Hansel, however , stretched out a little bone to
her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and
thought it was Hans el’s finger , and was astonished that there was no
way of fattening him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still
remained thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait
any longe r. ‘Now , then, Gretel,’  she cried to the girl, ‘stir yourself,
and bring some water . Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill
him, and cook him.’  Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when
she had to fetch the water , and how her tears did flow down her
cheeks! ‘Dear God, do help us,’ she cried. ‘If the wild beasts in the
forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together .’
‘Just keep your noise to yourself,’  said the old woman, ‘it won’ t help
you at all.’
Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the
cauldron with the water , and light the fire. ‘We will bake first,’  said
the old woman, ‘I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the
dough.’  She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames
of fire were already  darting. ‘Creep in,’ said the witch, ‘and see if it
is properly heated, so that we can put the bread in.’ And once Gretel
was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and
then she would eat her, too. But Gretel  saw what she had in mind,
and said: ‘I do not know how I am to do it; how do I get in?’ ‘Silly
goose,’  said the old woman. ‘The door is big enough; just look, I can
get in myself!’  and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the
iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then she began to howl quite6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

burnt to death. Gretel, however , ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little
stable, and cried: ‘Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!’
Then Hansel sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is
opened. How they did rejoice and embrace each other , and dance
about and kiss each other! And as they had no longer any need to
fear her, they went into the witch’ s house, and in every corner there
stood chests full of pearls and jewels. ‘These are far better than
pebbles!’  said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be
got in, and Gretel said: ‘I, too, will take something home with me,’
and filled her pinafo re full. ‘But now we must be off,’ said Hansel,
‘that we may get out of the witch’ s forest.’
When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch
of water. ‘We canno t cross,’  said Hansel , ‘I see no foot-plank, and no
bridge.’  ‘And there is also no ferry ,’ answered Gretel, ‘but a white
duck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.’ Then she
cried:
 ‘Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,
  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee? There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,

The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back,
and told his sister to sit by him. ‘No,’  replied Gretel, ‘that will be too
heavy for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other .’
The good little duck  did so, and when they were once safely across
and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and
more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father ’s
house. Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour , and threw
themselves round their father ’s neck. The man had not known one
happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman,
however , was dead. Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and
precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful
after another out of his pocket to add to them.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

SAUSAGE
Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into
partnership and set up house together . For a long time all went well;
they lived  in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add
considerably to their stores. The bird’ s duty was to fly daily into the
wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water , and the sausage
saw to the cooking. When people are too well off they always begin to long for
something new. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one
day, met a fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the
excellence of his household arrangemen ts. But the other bird sneered
at him for being a poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while
the other two stayed at home and had a good time of it. For, when the
mouse had made the fire and fetched in the water , she could retire
into her little room and rest until it was time to set the table. The
sausage had only to watch the pot to see that the food was properly
cooked, and when it was near dinner -time, he just threw himself into
the broth, or rolled in and out among the vegetables three or four
times, and there they were, buttered, and salted, and ready to be
served. Then, when the bird came home and had laid aside his
burden, they sat down to table, and when they had finished their
meal, they could sleep their fill till the following morning: and that
was really a very delightful life. Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to
bring in the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant
long enou gh, and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was
now time to make a change, and to try some other way of arranging
the work. Beg and pray as the mouse and the sausage might, it was
of no use; the bird remained master of the situation, and the venture
had to be made. They therefore drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to
bring in the wood, to the mouse to cook, and to the bird to fetch the
water . And now what happ ened? The sausage started in search of wood,
the bird made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these
two waited till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following
day. But the sausa ge remained so long away , that they became
uneasy , and the bird flew out to meet him. He had not flown far,
however , when he came across a dog who, having met the sausage,
had regar ded him as his legitimate booty , and so seized and
swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog of this bare-faced
robbery , but nothing he said was of any avail, for the dog answered
that he found false credentials on the sausage, and that was the
reason his life had been forfeited. He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse
all he had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy , but agreed6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

and, wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling
in and out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped
into the pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the
bottom, having already parted not only with her skin and hair, but
also with life. Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner , but
he could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry , he threw the
wood here and there about the floor , called and searched, but no cook
was to be found.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

thrown down, caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to
fetch some  water , but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as
he was unable to recover himself, he was drowned.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one
of them was beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The
mother , however , loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was
her own daughter , and so the other , who was only her stepdaughter ,
was made to do all the work of the house, and was quite the
Cinderella of the family . Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit
by the well in the high road, there to spin until she made her fingers
bleed. Now it chanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle,
and as the girl stopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle
suddenly sprang out of her hand and fell into the well. She ran home
crying to tell of her misfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to
her, and after giving her a violent scold ing, said unkindly , ‘As you
have let the spindle fall into the well you may go yourself and fetch
it out.’
The girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last
in her distress she jumped into the water after the spindle. She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself
in a beaut iful meado w, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers
blooming in every direction. She walked over the meadow , and presently she came upon a
baker ’s oven full of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, ‘Take us
out, take us out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked
through long ago.’  So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all
out. She went on a little farther , till she came to a tree full of apples. ‘Shake me, shake me, I pray,’ cried the tree; ‘my apples, one and all,
are ripe.’  So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down
upon her like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a
single apple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples
together in a heap and walked on again. The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an
old woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified,
and turned to run away . But the old woman called after her, ‘What
are you afraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work
of my house properly for me, I will make you very happy . You must
be very careful, however , to make my bed in the right way, for I wish
you always to shake  it thoroughly , so that the feathers fly about; then
they say, down there in the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother
Holle.’  The old wom an spoke so kindly , that the girl summoned up
courage and agreed to enter into her service. She took care to do everything according to the old woman’ s
bidding and every time she made the bed she shook it with all her
might, so that the feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The
old woman was as good as her word: she never spoke angrily to her,
and gave her roast and boiled meats every day .6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 64/201So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she
began to grow unha ppy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad,
but she became conscious at last of great longing to go home; then
she knew she was homesick, although she was a thousand times
better off with Mother Holle than with her mother and sister . After
waiting awhile, she went to Mother Holle and said, ‘I am so
homesick, that I cannot stay with you any longer , for although I am
so happy here, I must return to my own people.’
Then Mother Holle said, ‘I am pleased that you should want to go
back to your own people, and as you have served me so well and
faithfully , I will take you home myself.’
Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway . The
gate was opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold
fell upon her, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with
it from head to foot. ‘That is a reward for your industry ,’ said Mother Holle, and as she
spoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the
well. The gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the
old world close to her mother ’s house. As she entered the courtyard,
the cock who was perched on the well, called out:
 ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo! Your golden daughter’s come back to you.’
Then she went in to her mother and sister , and as she was so richly
covered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to
them all that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had
come by her great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy
daughter to go and try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit
by the well and spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her
hand into a thorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the
spindle; then she threw it into the well, and jumped in herself. Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow , and walked
over it till she came to the oven.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"‘Take us out, take us out, or alas! we
shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked  through long ago,’  cried the
loaves as before. But the lazy girl answered, ‘Do you think I am
going to dirty my hands for you?’  and walked on. Presently she came to the apple-tree. ‘Shake me, shake me, I pray;
my apples , one and all, are ripe,’  it cried . But she only answered, ‘A
nice thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,’
and passed on. At last she came to Mother Holle’ s house, and as she had heard all
about the large teeth from her sister , she was not afraid of them, and
engaged herself without delay to the old woman. The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted
herself to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she
should get in return . The next day, however , she began to dawdle
over her work, and the third day she was more idle still; then she
began to lie in bed in the mornings and refused to get up. Worse still,
she neglec ted to make the old woman’ s bed properly , and forgot to
shake it so that the feathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very
soon got tired of her, and told her she might go. The lazy girl was6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

mine.’  Mother Holle led her, as she had led her sister , to the broad
gateway; but as she was passing through, instead of the shower of
gold, a great bucketful of pitch came pouring over her . ‘That is in return for your services,’  said the old woman, and she
shut the gate. So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock
on the well called out as she saw her:
 ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo! Your dirty daughter’s come back to you.’
But, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it
stuck to her as long as she lived.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

HOOD]
Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by
everyone who looke d at her, but most of all by her grandmother , and
there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once
she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that
she would never wear anything else; so she was always called ‘Little
Red-Cap.’
One day her mother said to her: ‘Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a
piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother ,
she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets
hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run
off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your
grandmother will get nothing; and when  you go into her room, don’t
forget to say, “Goo d morning”, and don’t peep into every corner
before you do it.’
‘I will take great care,’ said Little Red-Cap to her mother , and
gave her hand on it. The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the
village, and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not
at all afraid of him. ‘Good day , Little Red-Cap,’  said he. ‘Thank you kindly , wolf.’
‘Whither away so early , Little Red-Cap?’
‘To my grandmother ’s.’
‘What have you got in your apron?’
‘Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day , so poor sick
grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger .’
‘Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?’
‘A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house
stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below;
you surely must know it,’  replied Little Red-Cap. The wolf thought to himself: ‘What a tender young creature! what
a nice plump mouthful—she will be better to eat than the old
woman. I must act craftily , so as to catch both.’  So he walked for a
short time by the side of Little Red-C ap, and then he said: ‘See,
Little Red-Cap, how pretty the flowers are about here—why do you
not look round? I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the
little birds  are singing; you walk gravel y along as if you were going
to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry .’
Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams
dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing
everywhere, she thought: ‘Suppose I take grandmother a fresh6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 67/201nosegay; that would please her too. It is so early in the day that I
shall still get there in good time’; and so she ran from the path into
the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she
fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it,
and so got deeper and deeper into the wood. Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother ’s house and
knocked at the door . ‘Who is there?’
‘Little Red-Cap,’  replied the wolf. ‘She is bringing cake and wine;
open the door .’
‘Lift the latch,’  called out the grandmother , ‘I am too weak, and
cannot get up.’
The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying
a word he went straight to the grandmo ther’s bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in
bed and drew the curtains. Little Red-Cap, however , had been running about picking flowers,
and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more,
she remembered her grandmother , and set out on the way to her . She was surprised to find the cottage -door standing open, and
when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she
said to herself: ‘Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today , and at other times
I like being with grandmother so much.’  She called out: ‘Good
morning,’  but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew
back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far
over her face, and looking very strange. ‘Oh! grandmother ,’ she said, ‘what big ears you have!’
‘The better to hear you with, my child,’  was the reply . ‘But, grandmother , what big eyes you have!’  she said. ‘The better to see you with, my dear .’
‘But, grandmother , what lar ge hands you have!’
‘The better to hug you with.’
‘Oh! but, grandmother , what a terrible big mouth you have!’
‘The better to eat you with!’
And scarc ely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was
out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap. When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the
bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just
passing the house, and thought to hims elf: ‘How the old woman is
snoring! I must just see if she wants anything.’  So he went into the
room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying
in it. ‘Do I find you here, you old sinner!’  said he. ‘I have long
sought you!’  Then just as he was going  to fire at him, it occurred to
him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother , and that she
might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and
began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf. When he had
made two snips, he saw the little Red-C ap shining, and then he made
two snips  more, and the little girl sprang out, crying: ‘Ah, how
frightened I have been! How dark it was inside the wolf ’; and after
that the aged grandm other came out alive also, but scarcely able to6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 68/201breathe. Red-Cap, however , quickly fetched great stones with which
they filled  the wolf ’s belly , and when he awoke, he wanted to run
away , but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell
dead. Then all three were  delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf ’s
skin and went home  with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank
the wine which Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap
thought to herself: ‘As long as I live, I will never by myself leave the
path, to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do
so.’
It also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to
the old grandmother , another wolf spok e to her, and tried to entice
her from the path. Red-Cap, however , was on her guard, and went
straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had
met the wolf, and that he had said ‘good morning’  to her, but with
such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the
public road she was certain he would have eaten her up. ‘Well,’ said
the grandmother , ‘we will shut the door, that he may not come in.’
Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried: ‘Open the door,
grandmother , I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you some
cakes.’  But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard
stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof,
intending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then
to steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother
saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone
trough, so she said to the child: ‘Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made
some sausages yesterday , so carry the water in which I boiled them
to the trough.’  Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and
peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could
no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from
the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-
Cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her
again.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter , and as
she was grown up, he was anxious that she should be well married
and provided for. He said to himself, ‘I will give her to the first
suitable man who comes and asks for her hand.’  Not long after a
suitor appeared, and as he appeared to be very rich and the miller
could see nothing in him with which to find fault, he betrothed his
daughter to him. But the girl did not care for the man as a girl ought
to care for her betrothed husband. She did not feel that she could
trust him, and she could not look at him nor think of him without an
inward shudder . One day he said to her, ‘You have not yet paid me a
visit, although we have been betrothed for some time.’  ‘I do not
know where your house is,’ she answere d. ‘My house is out there in
the dark forest,’  he said. She tried to excuse herself by saying that
she would not be able to find the way thither . Her betrothed only
replied, ‘You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already
invited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I
will strew ashes along the path.’
When Sunday came , and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling
of dread came over her which she could not explain, and that she
might be able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas
and lentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching
the entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and
these she followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at
every step she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the
deepest, darkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house,
looking so grim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"She
stepped inside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence
reigned throughout. Suddenly a voice cried:
 ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,
  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’
The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird
hanging in a cage on the wall. Again it cried:
 ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,
  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’
The girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but
they were all empty , and still she saw no one. At last she came to the
cellar , and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her
head from  shaking. ‘Can you tell me,’ asked the girl, ‘if my betrothed
husband lives here?’
‘Ah, you poor child,’  answered the old woman, ‘what a place for
you to come to! This is a murderers’  den. You think yourself a
promised bride, and that your marriage will soon take place, but it is
with death that you will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see
that large cauldron of water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have you in their power they will kill you without6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

take pity on you and save you, you would be lost.’
Thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite
hid her from view .","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"‘Keep as still as a mouse,’ she said; ‘do not move
or speak, or it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers
are all asleep, we will flee together . I have long been waiting for an
opportunity to escape.’
The words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew
returned, dragging another young girl along with them. They were all
drunk, and paid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her
wine to drink, three  glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and
one of yellow , and with that her heart gave way and she died. Then
they tore off her dainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her
beautiful body into pieces, and sprinkled salt upon it. The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind
the cask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her
by the robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining
on the little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it
off easily , he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger
sprang into the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl
who was hiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for
it, but he could not find it. ‘Have you looked behind the large cask?’
said one of the others. But the old woman called out, ‘Come and eat
your suppers, and let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won’ t run
away .’
‘The old woman is right,’  said the robbers, and they ceased
looking for the finger and sat down. The old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine,
and before long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar , fast
asleep and snoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came
from behin d the cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the
sleepers, who were lying close together , and every moment she was
filled with renewed dread lest she should awaken them. But God
helped her, so that she passed safely over them, and then she and the
old woma n went upstairs, opened the door, and hastened as fast as
they could from the murderers’  den. They found the ashes scattered
by the wind, but the peas and lentils had sprouted, and grown
sufficiently above the ground, to guide them in the moonlight along
the path. All night long they walked, and it was morning before they
reached the mill. Then the girl told her father all that had happened. The day came that had been fixed  for the marriage. The
bridegroom arrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller
had taken care to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the
feast, each guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and
did not say a word. ‘And you, my love,’  said the bridegroom, turning to her, ‘is there
no tale you know? Tell us something.’
‘I will tell you a dream, then,’  said the bride. ‘I went alone through
a forest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within,
but a bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:
 ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,
  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

‘My darling, this is only a dream.’
‘I went on through the house from room  to room, but they were all
empty , and everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went
down to the cellar , and there sat a very, very old woman, who could
not keep her head still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and
she answered, “Ah, you poor child, you are come to a murderers’
den; your betrothed does indeed live here, but he will kill you
without mercy and afterwards cook and eat you.”’
‘My darling, this is only a dream.’
‘The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she
done this when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl
along with them. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white,
red, and yellow , and with that she died.’
‘My darling, this is only a dream.’
‘Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body
into pieces and sprinkled salt upon it.’
‘My darling, this is only a dream.’
‘And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on
her finger , and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and
cut off her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind
the great cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.’  And
with these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the
assembled guests. The bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale,
up and tried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They deliv ered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band
were condemned to death for their wicked deeds.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

A poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by
the fireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. ‘How lonely it is,
wife,’  said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, ‘for you and me
to sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and
amuse us while other people seem so happy and merry with their
children!’  ‘What you say is very true,’  said the wife, sighing, and
turning round her wheel; ‘how happy should I be if I had but one
child! If it were ever so small—nay , if it were no bigger than my
thumb—I should be very happy , and love it dearly .’ Now—odd as
you may think it—it came to pass that this good woman’ s wish was
fulfilled, just in the very way she had wished it; for, not long
afterwards, she had a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong,
but was not much bigger than my thumb. So they said, ‘Well, we
cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and, little as he is,
we will love him dearly .’ And they called him Thomas Thumb. They gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never
grew bigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was
born. Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed
himself to be a clever little fellow , who always knew well what he
was about. One day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to
cut fuel, he said, ‘I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for
I want to make haste.’  ‘Oh, father ,’ cried Tom, ‘I will take care of
that; the cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.’ Then the
woodman laughed, and said, ‘How can that be? you cannot reach up
to the horse’ s bridle.’  ‘Never mind that, father ,’ said Tom; ‘if my
mother will only harness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him
which way to go.’  ‘Well,’ said the father , ‘we will try for once.’
When the time came the mother harne ssed the horse to the cart,
and put Tom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the
beast how to go, crying out, ‘Go on!’ and ‘Stop!’  as he wanted: and
thus the horse went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it
himself into the wood. It happened that as the horse was going a little
too fast, and Tom was calling out, ‘Gently! gently!’  two strangers
came up. ‘What an odd thing that is!’ said one: ‘there is a cart going
along, and I hear a carter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no
one.’  ‘Tha t is queer , indeed,’  said the other; ‘let us follow the cart,
and see where it goes.’  So they went on into the wood, till at last they
came to the place where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb,
seeing his father , cried out, ‘See, father , here I am with the cart, all
right and safe! now take me down!’  So his father took hold of the
horse with one hand, and with the other took his son out of the
horse’ s ear, and put him down upon a straw, where he sat as merry as
you please. The two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know
what to say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said,6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

him about from town to town as a show; we must buy him.’  So they
went up to the wood man, and asked him what he would take for the
little man. ‘He will be better off,’ said they, ‘with us than with you.’
‘I won’t sell him at all,’ said the father; ‘my own flesh and blood is
dearer to me than all the silver and gold in the world.’  But Tom,
hearing of the bargain they wanted to make, crept up his father ’s coat
to his shou lder and whispered in his ear, ‘Take the money , father , and
let them have me; I’ll soon come back to you.’
So the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for
a large piece of gold, and they paid the price. ‘Where would you like
to sit?’ said one of them. ‘Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will
be a nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country
as we go along.’  So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken
leave of his father they took him away with them. They journ eyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man
said, ‘Let me get down, I’m tired.’  So the man took off his hat, and
put him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of
the road. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped
into an old mouse-h ole. ‘Good night, my masters!’  said he, ‘I’m off! mind and look sharp  after me the next time.’ Then they ran at once to
the place, and poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but
all in vain; Tom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it
became quite dark, so that they were forced to go their way without
their prize, as sulky as could be. When Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. ‘What dangerous walking it is,’ said he, ‘in this ploughed field! If I
were to fall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly
break my neck.’  At last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-
shell. ‘This is lucky ,’ said he, ‘I can sleep here very well’; and in he
crept. Just as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by,
chatting together; and one said to the other, ‘How can we rob that
rich parson’ s house of his silver and gold?’  ‘I’ll tell you!’  cried Tom. ‘What noise was that?’  said the thief, frightened; ‘I’m sure I heard
someone speak.’  They stood still listeni ng, and Tom said, ‘Take me
with you, and I’ll soon show you how to get the parson’ s money .’
‘But where are you?’ said they. ‘Look about on the ground,’
answered he, ‘and listen where the sound comes from.’  At last the
thieves found him out, and lifted him up in their hands. ‘You little
urchin!’  they said, ‘what can you do for us?’ ‘Why , I can get between
the iron window-bars of the parson’ s house, and throw you out
whatever you want.’  ‘That’ s a good thought,’ said the thieves; ‘come
along, we shall see what you can do.’
When they came to the parson’ s house, Tom slipped through the
window-bars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could
bawl, ‘Will you have all that is here?’  At this the thieves were
frightened, and said, ‘Softly , softly! Speak low, that you may not
awaken anybody .’ But Tom seemed as if he did not understand them,
and bawled out again, ‘How much will you have? Shall I throw it all
out?’  Now  the cook lay in the next room; and hearing a noise she
raised herself up in her bed and listened. Meantime the thieves were
frightened, and ran off a little way; but at last they plucked up their6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

So they came back and whispered softly to him, saying, ‘Now let us
have no more of your roguish jokes; but throw us out some of the
money .’ Then Tom called out as loud as he could, ‘Very well! hold
your hands! here it comes.’
The cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran
to open the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails:
and the maid, having  groped about and found nothing, went away for
a light. By the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the
barn; and when she had looked about and searched every hole and
corner , and found nobody , she went to bed, thinking she must have
been dreaming with her eyes open. The little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a
snug place to finish his night’ s rest in; so he laid himself down,
meaning to sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his
father and mother . But alas!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"how woefully he was undone! what
crosses and sorrows happen to us all in this world! The cook got up
early , before daybreak, to feed the cows; and going straight to the
hay-loft, carried away a large bundle of hay, with the little man in the
middle of it, fast asleep. He still, however , slept on, and did not
awake till he found himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had
put the hay into the cow’ s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a
mouthful of it. ‘Good lack-a-day!’  said he, ‘how came I to tumble
into the mill?’  But he soon found out where he really was; and was
forced to have all his wits about him, that he might not get between
the cow’ s teeth, and so be crushed to death. At last down he went
into her stomach. ‘It is rather dark,’  said he; ‘they forgot to build
windows in this room to let the sun in; a candle would be no bad
thing.’
Though he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his
quarters at all; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was
always coming down, and the space left for him became smaller and
smaller . At last he cried out as loud as he could, ‘Don’ t bring me any
more hay! Don’ t bring me any more hay!’
The maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing
someone speak, but seeing nobody , and yet being quite sure it was
the same voice that she had heard in the night, she was so frightened
that she fell off her stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she
could pick herself up out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could
to her master the parson, and said, ‘Sir, sir, the cow is talking!’  But
the parson said, ‘Woman, thou art surely mad!’  However , he went
with her into the cow-house, to try and see what was the matter . Scarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out,
‘Don’ t bring me any more hay!’  Then the parson himself was
frightened; and thinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man
to kill her on the spot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the
stomach, in which Tom lay , was thrown out upon a dunghill. Tom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very
easy task; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out,
fresh ill-luck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed
up the whole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away .6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 75/201Tom, however , was still not dishearten ed; and thinking the wolf
would not dislike having some chat with him as he was going along,
he called out, ‘My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.’
‘Where’ s that?’  said the wolf. ‘In such and such a house,’  said Tom,
describing his own father ’s house. ‘You can crawl through the drain
into the kitchen and then into the pantry , and there you will find
cakes, ham, beef, cold chicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and
everything that your heart can wish.’
The wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he
went to the house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and
then into the pantry , and ate and drank there to his heart’ s content. As
soon as he had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten
so much that he could not go out by the same way he came in. This was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to
set up a great shou t, making all the noise he could. ‘Will you be
easy?’  said the wolf; ‘you’ll awaken everybody in the house if you
make such a clatter .’ ‘What’ s that to me?’  said the little man; ‘you
have had your frolic , now I’ve a mind to be merry myself ’; and he
began, singing and shouting as loud as he could. The wood man and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped
through a crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you
may well suppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman
ran for his axe, and gave his wife a scythe. ‘Do you stay behind,’  said
the woodman, ‘and when I have knocked him on the head you must
rip him up with the scythe.’  Tom heard all this, and cried out, ‘Father ,
father! I am here, the wolf has swallowed me.’ And his father said,
‘Heaven be praised! we have found our dear child again’; and he told
his wife not to use the scythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he
aimed a great blow , and struck the wolf on the head, and killed him
on the spot! and when he was dead they cut open his body , and set
Tommy free. ‘Ah!’  said the father , ‘wha t fears we have had for you!’
‘Yes, father,’ answered he; ‘I have travelled all over the world, I
think, in one way or other , since we parted; and now I am very glad
to come home and get fresh air again.’  ‘Why , where have you been?’
said his father . ‘I have been in a mouse-hole—and in a snail-shell—
and down a cow’ s throat—and in the wolf’s belly; and yet here I am
again, safe and sound.’
‘Well,’ said they, ‘you are come back,  and we will not sell you
again for all the riches in the world.’
Then they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him
plenty to eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they
fetched new clothes  for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled
on his journey . So Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and
mother , in peace; for though he had been so great a traveller , and had
done and seen so many fine things, and was fond enough of telling
the whole story , he always agreed that, after all, there’ s no place like

By the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine
stream of water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller ’s
house was close by, and the miller , you must know , had a very
beautiful daughter . She was, moreover , very shrewd and clever; and
the miller was so proud of her, that he one day told the king of the
land, who used to come and hunt in the wood, that his daughter
could spin gold out of straw . Now this king was very fond of money;
and when he heard the miller ’s boast his greediness was raised, and
he sent for the girl to be brought befor e him. Then he led her to a
chamber in his palace where there was a great heap of straw , and
gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, ‘All this must be spun into gold
before morning, as you love your life.’ It was in vain that the poor
maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father , for that she
could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber door was
locked, and she was left alone. She sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her
hard fate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking
little man hobbled in, and said, ‘Good morrow to you, my good lass;
what are you weeping for?’ ‘Alas!’  said she, ‘I must spin this straw
into gold, and I know not how.’ ‘What will you give me,’ said the
hobgoblin, ‘to do it for you?’  ‘My necklace,’  replied the maiden. He
took her at her word, and sat himse lf down to the wheel, and
whistled and sang:
 ‘Round about, round about,
    Lo and behold! Reel away, reel away,
    Straw into gold!’
And round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly
done, and the straw was all spun into gold. When the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and
pleased; but his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up
the poor miller’s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not
what to do, and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon
opened the door, and said, ‘What will you give me to do your task?’
‘The ring on my finger,’ said she. So her little friend took the ring,
and began to work at the wheel again, and whistled and sang:
 ‘Round about, round about,
    Lo and behold! Reel away, reel away,
    Straw into gold!’
till, long before morning, all was done again. The king was great ly delighted to see all this glittering treasure;
but still he had not enough: so he took the miller ’s daughter to a yet
larger heap, and said, ‘All this must be spun tonight; and if it is, you
shall be my queen.’  As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and
said, ‘Wha t will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?’  ‘I6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

little man, ‘the first little child that you may have when you are
queen.’  ‘That may never be,’ thought the miller ’s daughter: and as
she knew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do
what he asked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the
manikin once more spun the heap into gold. The king came in the
morning, and, findin g all he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so
he married the miller ’s daughter , and she really became queen. At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot
the dwarf,  and what she had said. But one day he came into her
room, where she was sitting playing with her baby , and put her in
mind of it. Then she grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she
would give him all the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off,
but in vain; till at last her tears softened him, and he said, ‘I will give
you three days’  grace, and if during that time you tell me my name,
you shall keep your child.’
Now the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names
that she had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to
find out new ones. The next day the little man came, and she began
with TIMOTHY , ICHABOD, BENJAM IN, JEREMIAH, and all the
names she could remember; but to all and each of them he said,
‘Madam, that is not my name.’
The secon d day she began with all the comical names she could
hear of, BANDY -LEGS, HUNCHBAC K, CROOK-SHANKS, and
so on; but the little gentleman still said to every one of them,
‘Madam, that is not my name.’
The third day one of the messengers came back, and said, ‘I have
travelled two days without hearing of any other names; but
yesterday , as I was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest
where the fox and the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little
hut; and before the hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny
little dwarf was dancing upon one leg, and singing:
  “Merrily the feast I’ll make. Today I’ll brew, tomorrow bake;
  Merrily I’ll dance and sing,
  For next day will a stranger bring. Little does my lady dream
  Rumpelstiltskin is my name!”
 
When the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her
little frien d came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her
court round to enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the
baby in her arms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the
little man began to chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to
take home with him to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, ‘Now ,
lady, what  is my name?’  ‘Is it JOHN?’  asked she. ‘No, madam!’  ‘Is it
TOM?’  ‘No, madam !’ ‘Is it JEMMY?’  ‘It is not.’ ‘Can your name be
RUMPELSTIL TSKIN?’  said the lady slyly . ‘Some witch told you
that!—some witch told you that!’  cried the little man, and dashed his
right foot in a rage so deep into the floor, that he was forced to lay
hold of it with both hands to pull it out. Then he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and
the baby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red
heels, and when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this
way and that, was quite happy and thought: ‘You certainly are a
pretty girl!’ And when she came home she drank, in her gladness of
heart, a draught of wine, and as wine excites a desire to eat, she
tasted the best of whatever she was cooking until she was satisfied,
and said: ‘The cook must know what the food is like.’
It came to pass that the master one day said to her: ‘Gretel, there is
a guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily .’ ‘I
will see to it, master ,’ answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded
them, plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set
them before the fire, that they might roast.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"The fowls began to turn
brown, and were nearly ready , but the guest had not yet arrived. Then
Gretel called out to her master: ‘If the guest does not come, I must
take the fowls away from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if
they are not eaten the moment they are at their juiciest.’  The master
said: ‘I will run myself, and fetch the guest.’  When the master had
turned his back, Gretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and
thought: ‘Standing so long by the fire there, makes one sweat and
thirsty; who knows when they will come ? Meanwhile, I will run into
the cellar , and take a drink.’  She ran down, set a jug, said: ‘God bless
it for you, Gretel,’  and took a good drink, and thought that wine
should flow on, and should not be interrupted, and took yet another
hearty draught. Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted
them, and drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt
so good, Gretel thought: ‘Something might be wrong, it ought to be
tasted!’  She touched it with her finger , and said: ‘Ah! how good
fowls are! It certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at
the right time!’  She ran to the window , to see if the master was not
coming with his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the
fowls and thought: ‘One of the wings is burning! I had better take it
off and eat it.’ So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she
had done, she thought: ‘The other must go down too, or else master
will observe that something is missing.’  When the two wings were
eaten, she went and looked for her master, and did not see him. It
suddenly occurred to her: ‘Who knows? They are perhaps not
coming at all, and have turned in somew here.’  Then she said: ‘Well,
Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has been cut into, take another
drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is eaten you will have some
peace, why should God’ s good gifts be spoilt?’  So she ran into the
cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the one chicken in
great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down, and still
her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said: ‘What
one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what’ s right
for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take another6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 80/201draught it would do me no harm.’  So she took another hearty drink,
and let the second chicken follow the first. While she was making the most of it, her master came and cried:
‘Hurry up, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!’ ‘Yes, sir, I
will soon serve up,’ answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to
see that the table was properly laid, and took the great knife,
wherewith he was going to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on
the steps. Presently the guest came, and knocked politely and
courteously at the house-door . Gretel ran, and looked to see who was
there, and when she saw the guest, she put her finger to her lips and
said: ‘Hus h! hush! go away as quickl y as you can, if my master
catches you it will be the worse for you; he certainly did ask you to
supper , but his inten tion is to cut off your two ears. Just listen how he
is sharpen ing the knife for it!’ The guest heard the sharpening, and
hurried down the steps again as fast as he could. Gretel was not idle;
she ran screaming to her master , and cried: ‘You have invited a fine
guest!’  ‘Why, Gretel? What do you mean by that?’  ‘Yes,’ said she,
‘he has taken the chickens which I was just going to serve up, off the
dish, and has run away with them!’  ‘That’s a nice trick!’  said her
master , and lamented the fine chickens. ‘If he had but left me one, so
that something remained for me to eat.’ He called to him to stop, but
the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him with the knife
still in his hand, crying: ‘Just one, just one,’  meaning that the guest
should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The guest,
however , thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of his
ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take them
both with him.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his
ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he
could hardly hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth
or let it run out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were
disgusted at this, so the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner
behind the stove, and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl,
and not even enoug h of it. And he used to look towards the table
with his eyes full of tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not
hold the bowl, and it fell to the ground  and broke. The young wife
scolded him, but he said nothing and only sighed. Then they brought
him a wooden bowl for a few half-pence, out of which he had to eat. They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years
old began to gather  together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are you doing there?’  asked the father . ‘I am making a little
trough,’  answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when
I am big.’
The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and
presently began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the
table, and henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said
nothing if he did spill a little of anything.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich
peasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one,
and yet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to
her: ‘Liste n, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter , he
shall make  us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like
any other, and in time it will certainly  get big and be a cow.’ the
woman also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and
planed the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its
head hanging down as if it were eating. Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little
peasant called the cow-herd in and said: ‘Look, I have a little calf
there, but it is still small and has to be carried.’  The cow-herd said:
‘All right,’  and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and
set it among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like
one which  was eating, and the cow-he rd said: ‘It will soon run by
itself, just look how it eats already!’  At night when he was going to
drive the herd home again, he said to the calf: ‘If you can stand there
and eat your fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don’t care to
drag you home again in my arms.’  But the little peasant stood at his
door, and waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the
cows through the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired
where it was. The cow-herd answered: ‘It is still standing out there
eating. It would not stop and come with us.’ But the little peasant
said: ‘Oh, but I must have my beast back again.’  Then they went
back to the meadow together , but someone had stolen the calf, and it
was gone. The cow- herd said: ‘It must have run away .’ The peasant,
however , said: ‘Don’ t tell me that,’  and led the cow-herd before the
mayor , who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a
cow for the calf which had run away . And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which
they had so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no
food for it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be
killed. They salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and
wanted to sell the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the
proceeds. On the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with
broken wings, and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the
skin. But as the weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain
and wind, he could  go no farther , and turned back to the mill and
begged for shelter . The miller ’s wife was alone in the house, and said
to the peasant: ‘Lay yourself on the straw there,’  and gave him a slice
of bread and cheese. The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin
beside him, and the woman thought: ‘He is tired and has gone to
sleep.’  In the meant ime came the parson; the miller ’s wife received
him well, and said: ‘My husband is out, so we will have a feast.’  The
peasant listened, and when he heard them talk about feasting he was
vexed that he had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread and6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

salad, cakes, and wine.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking
outside. The woman said: ‘Oh, heave ns! It is my husband!’  she
quickly hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the
pillow , the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the
closet on the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and
said: ‘Tha nk heaven , you are back again! There is such a storm, it
looks as if the world were coming to an end.’  The miller saw the
peasant lying on the straw , and asked, ‘What is that fellow doing
there?’  ‘Ah,’  said the wife, ‘the poor knave came in the storm and
rain, and begged for shelter , so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese,
and showed him where the straw was.’  The man said: ‘I have no
objection, but be quick and get me something to eat.’ The woman
said: ‘But I have nothing but bread and cheese.’  ‘I am contented with
anything,’  replied the husband, ‘so far as I am concerned, bread and
cheese will do,’ and looked at the peasant and said: ‘Come and eat
some more with me.’ The peasant did not require to be invited twice,
but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin in which the
raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: ‘What have you there?’
The peasant answered: ‘I have a soothsayer inside it.’ ‘Can he
foretell anything to me?’  said the mille r. ‘Why not?’  answered the
peasant: ‘but he only says four things , and the fifth he keeps to
himself.’  The miller was curious, and said: ‘Let him foretell
something for once.’  Then the peasant pinched the raven’ s head, so
that he croaked and made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: ‘What
did he say?’ The peasant answered: ‘In the first place, he says that
there is some wine hidden under the pillow .’ ‘Bless me!’ cried the
miller , and went there and found the wine. ‘Now go on,’ said he. The
peasant made the raven croak again, and said: ‘In the second place,
he says that there is some roast meat in the tiled stove.’  ‘Upon my
word!’  cried the miller, and went thithe r, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven prophesy still more, and said: ‘Thirdly ,
he says that there is some salad on the bed.’  ‘That would be a fine
thing!’  cried the miller , and went there  and found the salad. At last
the peasant pinched the raven once more till he croaked, and said:
‘Fourthly , he says that there are some cakes under the bed.’  ‘That
would be a fine thing!’ cried the miller , and looked there, and found
the cakes. And now the two sat down to the table together , but the miller ’s
wife was frightened  to death, and went to bed and took all the keys
with her. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the
little peasa nt said: ‘First, we will quickl y eat the four things, for the
fifth is something bad.’ So they ate, and after that they bargained
how much  the miller was to give for the fifth prophecy , until they
agreed on three hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched
the raven’ s head till he croaked loudly . The miller asked: ‘What did
he say?’  The peasant replied: ‘He says that the Devil is hiding
outside there in the closet on the porch.’  The miller said: ‘The Devil
must go out,’ and opened the house- door; then the woman was
forced to give up the keys, and the peasant unlocked the closet. The
parson ran out as fast as he could, and the miller said: ‘It was true; I
saw the black rascal with my own eyes.’  The peasant, however , made
off next morning by daybreak with the three hundred talers.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

beautiful house, and the peasants said: ‘The small peasant has
certainly been to the place where golden  snow falls, and people carry
the gold home in shovels.’  Then the small peasant was brought
before the mayor , and bidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: ‘I sold my cow’ s skin in the town, for three hundred
talers.’  When the peasants heard that, they too wished to enjoy this
great profi t, and ran home, killed all their cows, and stripped off their
skins in order to sell them in the town to the greatest advantage. The
mayor , however , said: ‘But my servan t must go first.’  When she
came to the merchant in the town, he did not give her more than two
talers for a skin, and when the others came, he did not give them so
much, and said: ‘What can I do with all these skins?’
Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have
thus outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused
him of this treacher y before the mayor . The innocent little peasant
was unani mously sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the
water , in a barrel pierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest
was brought who was to say a mass for his soul. The others were all
obliged to retire to a distance, and when the peasant looked at the
priest, he recognized the man who had been with the miller ’s wife. He said to him: ‘I set you free from the closet, set me free from the
barrel.’  At this same moment up came, with a flock of sheep, the
very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long been wishing to be
mayor , so he cried with all his might: ‘No, I will not do it; if the
whole world insists on it, I will not do it!’ The shepherd hearing that,
came up to him, and asked: ‘What are you about? What is it that you
will not do?’ The peasant said: ‘They want to make me mayor , if I
will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.’ The shepherd
said: ‘If nothing more than that is needful in order to be mayor , I
would get into the barrel at once.’  The peasant said: ‘If you will get
in, you will be mayor .’ The shepherd was willing, and got in, and the
peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd’ s flock
for himself, and drove it away . The parson went to the crowd, and
declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the
barrel towards the water . When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd
cried: ‘I am quite willing to be mayor .’ They believed no otherwise
than that it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered:
‘That is what we intend, but first you shall look about you a little
down below there,’  and they rolled the barrel down into the water . After that the peasa nts went home, and as they were entering the
village, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of
sheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were
astonished, and said: ‘Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you
come out of the wate r?’ ‘Yes, truly,’ replied the peasant, ‘I sank deep,
deep down , until at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out
of the barrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which
a number of lambs  were feeding, and from thence I brought this
flock away with me.’ Said the peasants:  ‘Are there any more there?’
‘Oh, yes,’ said he, ‘more than I could want.’  Then the peasants made
up their minds that they too would fetch  some sheep for themselves,
a flock apiece, but the mayor said: ‘I come first.’  So they went to the
water together, and just then there were some of the small fleecy
clouds in the blue sky, which are called little lambs, and they were6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

the sheep down below!’  The mayor pressed forward and said: ‘I will
go down first, and look about me, and if things promise well I’ll call
you.’  So he jumped in; splash! went the water; it sounded as if he
were calling them, and the whole crowd plunged in after him as one
man.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name
was Catherine, and they had not long been married. One day
Frederick said.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"‘Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come
back I shall be hung ry so let me have something nice cooked, and a
good draught of ale.’ ‘Very well,’  said she, ‘it shall all be ready .’
When dinner -time drew nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was
all the meat she had, and put it on the fire to fry. The steak soon
began to look brown, and to crackle in the pan; and Catherine stood
by with a fork and turned it: then she said to herself, ‘The steak is
almost ready , I may as well go to the cellar for the ale.’ So she left
the pan on the fire and took a large jug and went into the cellar and
tapped the ale cask. The beer ran into the jug and Catherine stood
looking on. At last it popped into her head, ‘The dog is not shut up—
he may be running away with the steak; that’s well thought of.’ So up
she ran from the cellar; and sure enough the rascally cur had got the
steak in his mouth, and was making of f with it. Away ran Catherine , and away ran the dog across the field: but he
ran faster than she, and stuck close to the steak. ‘It’s all gone, and
“what can’t be cured must be endured”,’  said Catherine. So she
turned round; and as she had run a good way and was tired, she
walked home leisurely to cool herself. Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not
turned the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the
floor till the cask was empty . When she got to the cellar stairs she
saw what had happened. ‘My stars!’  said she, ‘what shall I do to keep
Frederick from seeing all this sloppin g about?’  So she thought a
while; and at last remembered that there was a sack of fine meal
bought at the last fair, and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it
would suck up the ale nicely . ‘What a lucky thing,’  said she, ‘that we
kept that meal! we have now a good use for it.’ So away she went for
it: but she managed to set it down just upon the great jug full of beer,
and upset it; and thus all the ale that had been saved was set
swimming on the floor also. ‘Ah! well,’  said she, ‘when one goes
another may as well follow .’ Then she strewed the meal all about the
cellar , and was quite pleased with her cleverness, and said, ‘How
very neat and clean it looks!’
At noon Frederick came home. ‘Now , wife,’  cried he, ‘what have
you for dinner?’  ‘O Frederick!’  answered she, ‘I was cooking you a
steak; but while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with
it; and while I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry
up the ale with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the
jug: but the cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!’  ‘Kate, Kate,’
said he, ‘how could you do all this?’  Why did you leave the steak to
fry, and the ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?’  ‘Why , Frederick,’
said she, ‘I did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told
me before.’6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 87/201The husband thought to himself, ‘If my wife manages matters
thus, I must look sharp myself.’  Now he had a good deal of gold in
the house: so he said to Catherine, ‘Wha t pretty yellow buttons these
are! I shall put them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take
care that you never go near or meddle with them.’  ‘No, Frederick,’
said she, ‘that I never will.’  As soon as he was gone, there came by
some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her
whether she would buy.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"‘Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much,
but I have  no money: if you had any use for yellow buttons, I might
deal with you.’  ‘Yellow buttons!’  said they: ‘let us have a look at
them.’  ‘Go into the garden and dig wher e I tell you, and you will find
the yellow buttons: I dare not go myself.’  So the rogues went: and
when they found what these yellow buttons were, they took them all
away , and left her plenty of plates and dishes. Then she set them all
about the house for a show: and when Frederick came back, he cried
out, ‘Kate, what have you been doing?’  ‘See,’  said she, ‘I have
bought all these with your yellow buttons: but I did not touch them
myself; the pedlars went themselves and dug them up.’ ‘Wife, wife,’
said Frederick, ‘what a pretty piece of work you have made! those
yellow buttons were all my money: how came you to do such a
thing?’  ‘Why ,’ answered she, ‘I did not know there was any harm in
it; you should have told me.’
Catherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her
husband, ‘Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us
run after the thieve s.’ ‘Well, we will try,’ answered he; ‘but take
some butte r and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat
by the way.’ ‘Very well,’ said she; and they set out: and as Frederick
walked the fastest, he left his wife some way behind. ‘It does not
matter ,’ thought she: ‘when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer
home than he.’
Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which
there was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the
trees on each side as they passed. ‘Ah, see now,’ said she, ‘how they
have bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get
well.’  So she took pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease
them all, so that the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she
was doing  this kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket,
and rolled down the hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it
had gone; so she said, ‘Well, I suppose the other will go the same
way and find you; he has younger legs than I have.’  Then she rolled
the other cheese after it; and away it went, nobody knows where,
down the hill. But she said she supposed that they knew the road,
and would  follow her, and she could not stay there all day waiting for
them. At last she overtoo k Frederick, who desired her to give him
something to eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. ‘Where are the
butter and cheese?’  said he. ‘Oh!’  answered she, ‘I used the butter to
grease those poor trees that the wheel s chafed so: and one of the
cheeses ran away so I sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose
they are both on the road together somewhere.’  ‘What a goose you
are to do such silly things!’  said the husband. ‘How can you say so?’
said she; ‘I am sure you never told me not.’6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 88/201They ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, ‘Kate, I hope
you locked the door safe when you came away .’ ‘No,’  answered she,
‘you did not tell me.’ ‘Then go home, and do it now before we go
any farther ,’ said Frederick, ‘and bring with you something to eat.’
Catherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,
‘Frederick wants something to eat; but I don’t think he is very fond
of butter and cheese: I’ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the
vinegar , for I have often seen him take some.’
When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front
door she took off the hinges, and said, ‘Frederick told me to lock the
door, but surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.’ So she
took her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she
cried out, ‘There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it
as carefully as you please.’  ‘Alas! alas!’  said he, ‘what a clever wife I
have! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away ,
so that everybody may go in and out as they please—however , as
you have brought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your
pains.’  ‘Very well,’  answered she, ‘I’ll carry the door; but I’ll not
carry the nuts and vinegar bottle also—that would be too much of a
load; so if you please, I’ll fasten them to the door .’
Frederick of course made no objection  to that plan, and they set
off into the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find
them: and when it grew dark, they climb ed up into a tree to spend the
night there. Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the
very rogue s they were looking for. They were in truth great rascals,
and belonged to that class of people who find things before they are
lost; they were tired; so they sat down and made a fire under the very
tree where  Frederick and Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on
the other side, and picked up some stones. Then he climbed up again,
and tried to hit the thieves on the head with them: but they only said,
‘It must be near morning, for the wind shakes the fir -apples down.’
Catherine, who had the door on her shoulder , began to be very
tired; but she though t it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so
she said softly, ‘Fred erick, I must let the nuts go.’ ‘No,’  answered he,
‘not now, they will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that: they must go.’
‘Well, then, make haste and throw them down, if you will.’  Then
away rattled the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves
cried, ‘Bless me, it is hailing.’
A little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very
heavy: so she whispered to Frederick,  ‘I must throw the vinegar
down.’  ‘Pray don’t,’ answered he, ‘it will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help
that,’  said she, ‘go it must.’  So she poured all the vinegar down; and
the thieves said, ‘What a heavy dew there is!’
At last it popped into Catherine’ s head that it was the door itself
that was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, ‘Frederick, I must
throw the door down soon.’  But he begg ed and prayed her not to do
so, for he was sure it would betray them. ‘Here goes, however ,’ said
she: and down went the door with such a clatter upon the thieves,
that they cried out ‘Murder!’  and not knowing what was coming, ran
away as fast as they could, and left all the gold.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and
had two daughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved
because she was her own daughter , and one beautiful and good, and
this one she hated, because she was her stepdaughter . The
stepdaughter once had a pretty apron, which the other fancied so
much that she became envious, and told her mother that she must
and would have that apron. ‘Be quiet, my child,’  said the old woman,
‘and you shall have it. Your stepsiste r has long deserved death;
tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her head off. Only be
careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and push her well to the
front.’  It would have been all over with the poor girl if she had not
just then been stand ing in a corner , and heard everything. All day
long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime had come, the
witch’ s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the far side, but
when she was asleep, the other pushed  her gently to the front, and
took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall. In the night,
the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right hand,
and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside, and
then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child’ s
head of f. When she had gone away , the girl got up and went to her
sweetheart, who was called Roland, and knocked at his door. When
he came out, she said to him: ‘Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in
all haste; my stepm other wanted to kill me, but has struck her own
child. When daylight comes, and she sees what she has done, we
shall be lost.’  ‘But,’  said Roland, ‘I coun sel you first to take away her
magic wand, or we cannot escape if she pursues us.’ The maiden
fetched the magic wand, and she took the dead girl’s head and
dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in front of the bed,
one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then she hurried away with
her lover . When the old witch  got up next morning, she called her daughter ,
and wante d to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the
witch cried: ‘Where are you?’  ‘Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,’
answered the first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw
no one on the stairs, and cried again: ‘Where are you?’  ‘Here in the
kitchen, I am warmi ng myself,’  cried the second drop of blood. She
went into the kitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again:
‘Where are you?’  ‘Ah, here in the bed, I am sleeping,’  cried the third
drop of blood. She went into the room to the bed. What did she see
there? Her own child, whose head she had cut off, bathed in her
blood. The witch fell into a passion, sprang to the window , and as
she could look forth quite far into the world, she perceived her
stepdaughter hurrying away with her sweetheart Roland. ‘That shall
not help you,’  cried she, ‘even if you have got a long way off, you
shall still not escap e me.’ She put on her many-league boots, in
which she covered an hour’s walk at every step, and it was not long6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 90/201before she overtook them. The girl, however , when she saw the old
woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic wand, her
sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck swimming in
the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore, threw
breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck; but
the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to go
home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart
Roland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the
whole night until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a
beautiful flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her
sweetheart Roland into a fiddler . It was not long before the witch
came striding up towards them, and said to the musician: ‘Dear
musician, may I pluck that beautiful flower for myself?’  ‘Oh, yes,’ he
replied, ‘I will play to you while you do it.’ As she was hastily
creeping into the hedge and was just going to pluck the flower ,
knowing perfectly well who the flower was, he began to play, and
whether she would or not, she was forced to dance, for it was a
magical dance. The faster he played, the more violent springs was
she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes from her body ,
and pricke d her and wounded her till she bled, and as he did not stop,
she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground. As they were now set free, Roland said: ‘Now I will go to my
father and arrange for the wedding.’  ‘Then in the meantime I will
stay here and wait for you,’  said the girl, ‘and that no one may
recognize me, I will change myself into a red stone landmark.’  Then
Roland went away , and the girl stood like a red landmark in the field
and waited for her beloved. But when Roland got home, he fell into
the snares of another , who so fascinated him that he forgot the
maiden. The poor girl remained there a long time, but at length, as he
did not return at all, she was sad, and changed herself into a flower ,
and thoug ht: ‘Someone will surely come this way, and trample me
down.’
It befell, however , that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and
saw the flower , and as it was so pretty , plucked it, took it with him,
and laid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things
happened in the shepherd’ s house. When he arose in the morning, all
the work was alrea dy done, the room was swept, the table and
benches cleaned, the fire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was
fetched, and at noon , when he came home, the table was laid, and a
good dinner served. He could not conc eive how this came to pass,
for he never saw a human being in his house, and no one could have
concealed himself in it. He was certainly pleased with this good
attendance, but still at last he was so afraid that he went to a wise
woman and asked for her advice. The wise woman said: ‘There is
some enchantment behind it, listen very early some morning if
anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no matter
what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will be
stopped.’
The shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day
dawned, he saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he
sprang towards it, and threw a white  cloth over it. Instantly the
transformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him,
who admitted to him that she had been the flower , and that up to this6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

and as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she
answered: ‘No,’  for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart
Roland, although he had deserted her.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Nevertheless, she promised
not to go away , but to continue keeping house for the shepherd. And now the time drew near when Roland’ s wedding was to be
celebrated, and then, according to an old custom in the country , it
was announced that all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in
honour of the bridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she
grew so sad that she thought her heart would break, and she would
not go thither , but the other girls came and took her. When it came to
her turn to sing, she stepped back, until at last she was the only one
left, and then she could not refuse. But when she began her song, and
it reached Roland’ s ears, he sprang up and cried: ‘I know the voice,
that is the true bride, I will have no other!’  Everything he had
forgotten, and which had vanished from his mind, had suddenly
come home again to his heart. Then the faithful maiden held her
wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and grief came to an end and
joy began.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

It was the middle of winter , when the broad flakes of snow were
falling around, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off
sat working at her window . The frame of the window was made of
fine black ebony , and as she sat looking out upon the snow , she
pricked her finger , and three drops of blood fell upon it. Then she
gazed thoughtfully upon the red drops that sprinkled the white snow ,
and said, ‘Would that my little daugh ter may be as white as that
snow , as red as that blood, and as black as this ebony windowframe!’
And so the little girl really did grow up; her skin was as white as
snow , her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and her hair as black as ebony;
and she was called Snowdrop. But this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who
became queen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not
bear to think that anyone could be hand somer than she was. She had
a fairy looking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would
gaze upon herself in it, and say:
 ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true! Of all the ladies in the land,
  Who is fairest, tell me, who?’
And the glass had always answered:
 ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.’
But Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was
seven years old she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the
queen herself. Then the glass one day answered the queen, when she
went to look in it as usual:
 ‘Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see,
  But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!’
When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy , and
called to one of her servants, and said, ‘Take Snowdrop away into
the wide wood, that I may never see her any more.’  Then the servant
led her away; but his heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to
spare her life, and he said, ‘I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.’  So
he left her by herse lf; and though he thought it most likely that the
wild beast s would tear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were
taken off his heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but
to leave her to her fate, with the chance of someone finding and
saving her . Then poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great
fear; and the wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the evening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to
rest, for her little feet would carry her no further . Everything was
spruce and neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth,
and there were seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little
glasses with wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order;6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

picked a little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of
each glass ; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So
she tried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too
short, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself
down and went to sleep. By and by in came  the masters of the cottage. Now they were
seven little dwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and
searched for gold. They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at
once that all was not right.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"The first said, ‘Who has been sitting on
my stool? ’ The second, ‘Who has been eating off my plate?’  The
third, ‘Who has been picking my bread?’  The fourth, ‘Who has been
meddling with my spoon?’  The fifth, ‘Who has been handling my
fork?’  The sixth, ‘Who has been cutting with my knife?’  The seventh,
‘Who has been drinking my wine?’  Then the first looked round and
said, ‘Who has been  lying on my bed?’  And the rest came running to
him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his bed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come
and see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and
brought their lamps to look at her, and said, ‘Good heavens! what a
lovely child she is!’ And they were very glad to see her, and took
care not to wake her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each
of the other dwarfs in turn, till the night was gone. In the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied
her, and said if she would keep all things in order , and cook and
wash and knit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and
they woul d take good care of her. Then they went out all day long to
their work, seeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but
Snowdrop was left at home; and they warned her, and said, ‘The
queen will soon find out where you are, so take care and let no one
in.’
But the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed
that she must be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her
glass and said:
 ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true! Of all the ladies in the land,
  Who is fairest, tell me, who?’
And the glass answered:
 ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:
  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,
  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,
  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she
  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’
Then the queen was very much frighten ed; for she knew that the
glass always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had
betrayed her. And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who
was more beautiful than she was; so she dressed herself up as an old
pedlar , and went her way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs
dwelt. Then she knocked at the door, and cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’
Snowdrop looked out at the window , and said, ‘Good day, good
woman! what have you to sell?’  ‘Good wares, fine wares,’  said she;
‘laces and bobbins of all colours.’  ‘I will let the old lady in; she
seems to be a very good sort of body ,’ thought Snowdrop, as she ran6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 94/201down and unbolted the door. ‘Bless me!’ said the old woman, ‘how
badly your stays are laced! Let me lace them up with one of my nice
new laces .’ Snowdrop did not dream of any mischief; so she stood
before the old woma n; but she set to work so nimbly , and pulled the
lace so tight, that Snowdrop’ s breath was stopped, and she fell down
as if she were dead. ‘There’ s an end to all thy beauty ,’ said the
spiteful queen, and went away home. In the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say
how grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out
upon the ground, as if she was quite dead. However , they lifted her
up, and when they found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a
little time she began to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, ‘The old woman was the queen herself; take care
another time, and let no one in when we are away .’
When the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and
spoke to it as before; but to her great grief it still said:
 ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:
  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,
  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,
  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she
  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’
Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see
that Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in
quite anoth er dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a
poisoned comb. When she reached the dwarfs’  cottage, she knocked
at the door, and cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’  But Snowdrop said, ‘I
dare not let anyone in.’ Then the queen said, ‘Only look at my
beautiful combs!’  and gave her the poisoned one. And it looked so
pretty , that she took it up and put it into her hair to try it; but the
moment it touched her head, the poison was so powerful that she fell
down senseless. ‘There you may lie,’ said the queen, and went her
way. But by good luck the dwarfs came in very early that evening;
and when they saw Snowdrop lying on the ground, they thought
what had happened, and soon found the poisoned comb. And when
they took it away she got well, and told them all that had passed; and
they warned her once more not to open the door to anyone. Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage
when she read the very same answer as before; and she said,
‘Snowdrop shall die, if it cost me my life.’ So she went by herself
into her chamber , and got ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked
very rosy and tempting, but whoever tasted it was sure to die. Then
she dressed herself up as a peasant’ s wife, and travelled over the hills
to the dwarfs’  cotta ge, and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put
her head out of the window and said, ‘I dare not let anyone in, for the
dwarfs have told me not.’ ‘Do as you please,’  said the old woman,
‘but at any rate take this pretty apple; I will give it you.’  ‘No,’  said
Snowdrop, ‘I dare not take it.’ ‘You silly girl!’  answered the other ,
‘what are you afraid of? Do you think it is poisoned?","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Come! do you
eat one part, and I will eat the other .’ Now the apple was so made up
that one side was good, though the other side was poisoned. Then
Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for the apple looked so very
nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she could wait no longer . But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth, when she fell6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 95/201down dead upon the ground. ‘This time nothing will save thee,’  said
the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it said:
 ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.’
And then her wicked  heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart
could be. When evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found
Snowdrop lying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and
they were afraid that she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and
combed her hair, and washed her face with wine and water; but all
was in vain, for the little girl seemed quite dead. So they laid her
down upon a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three
whole days; and then they thought they would bury her: but her
cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just as it did while she
was alive; so they said, ‘We will never bury her in the cold ground.’
And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might still look at her,
and wrote  upon it in golden letters what her name was, and that she
was a king’s daught er. And the coffin was set among the hills, and
one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the birds of the
air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop;  and first of all came an owl,
and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side. And thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked
as though she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow ,
and as red as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and
called at the dwarfs’  house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what
was written in golde n letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money , and
prayed and besough t them to let him take her away; but they said,
‘We will not part with her for all the gold in the world.’  At last,
however , they had pity on him, and gave him the coffin; but the
moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him, the piece of apple
fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop awoke, and said, ‘Where
am I?’  And the prince said, ‘Thou art quite safe with me.’
Then he told her all that had happened, and said, ‘I love you far
better than all the world; so come with me to my father ’s palace, and
you shall be my wife.’  And Snowdrop consented, and went home
with the prince; and everything was got ready with great pomp and
splendour for their wedding. To the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop’ s old enemy the
queen; and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she
looked in the glass and said:
 ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true! Of all the ladies in the land,
  Who is fairest, tell me, who?’
And the glass answered:
 ‘Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween;
  But lovelier far is the new-made queen.’
When she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and
curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the
bride. And when she got there, and saw that it was no other than
Snowdrop, who, as she thought, had been dead a long while, she
choked with rage, and fell down and died: but Snowdrop and the
prince lived and reigned happily over that land many , many years;6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

There was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no
children. Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God
in heaven to bestow  on her a son or a daughter .","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Then an angel from
heaven came to her and said: ‘Be at rest, you shall have a son with
the power of wishing, so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for,
that shall he have.’  Then she went to the king, and told him the joyful
tidings, and when the time was come she gave birth to a son, and the
king was filled with gladness. Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the
wild beasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It
happened once when the child was a little older , that it was lying in
her arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that
the child had the power of wishing, and stole it away , and he took a
hen, and cut it in pieces, and droppe d some of its blood on the
queen’ s apron and on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a
secret place, where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the
king and accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken
from her by the wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her
apron, he believed this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high
tower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and
had his wife put into it, and walled up. Here she was to stay for
seven years without meat or drink, and die of hunger . But God sent
two angels from heaven in the shape of white doves, which flew to
her twice a day , and carried her food until the seven years were over . The cook, however , thought to himself: ‘If the child has the power
of wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.’
So he left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big
enough to speak, and said to him: ‘Wish for a beautiful palace for
yourself with a garden, and all else that pertains to it.’ Scarcely were
the words out of the boy’s mouth, when everything was there that he
had wished for. After a while the cook said to him: ‘It is not well for
you to be so alone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.’  Then the
king’ s son wished for one, and she immediately stood before him,
and was more beaut iful than any painter could have painted her. The
two played together , and loved each other with all their hearts, and
the old cook went out hunting like a nobleman.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"The thought occurred
to him, however , that the king’ s son might some day wish to be with
his father , and thus bring him into great peril. So he went out and
took the maiden aside, and said: ‘Tonigh t when the boy is asleep, go
to his bed and plung e this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart
and tongue, and if you do not do it, you shall lose your life.’
Thereupon he went away , and when he returned next day she had not
done it, and said: ‘Why should I shed the blood of an innocent boy
who has never harm ed anyone?’  The cook once more said: ‘If you do
not do it, it shall cost you your own life.’ When he had gone away ,
she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her to be killed, and
took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate, and when she6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

and draw the clothes  over you.’  Then the wicked wretch came in and
said: ‘Where are the boy’s heart and tongue?’  The girl reached the
plate to him, but the king’ s son threw off the quilt, and said: ‘You old
sinner , why did you want to kill me? Now will I pronounce thy
sentence.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar
round your neck, and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst
forth from  your throat.’  And when he had spoken these words, the
old man was change d into a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round
his neck, and the cooks were ordered to bring up some live coals,
and these he ate, until the flames broke forth from his throat. The
king’ s son remained  there a short while longer , and he thought of his
mother , and wonder ed if she were still alive. At length he said to the
maiden: ‘I will go home to my own country; if you will go with me, I
will provide for you.’ ‘Ah,’  she replied, ‘the way is so long, and what
shall I do in a stran ge land where I am unknown?’  As she did not
seem quite willing, and as they could not be parted from each other ,
he wished that she might be changed into a beautiful pink, and took
her with him. Then he went away to his own country , and the poodle
had to run after him. He went to the tower in which his mother was
confined, and as it was so high, he wished for a ladder which would
reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up and looked inside, and
cried: ‘Beloved mother , Lady Queen, are you still alive, or are you
dead?’  She answered: ‘I have just eaten, and am still satisfied,’  for
she thought the angels were there. Said he: ‘I am your dear son,
whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms; but I
am alive still, and will soon set you free.’  Then he descended again,
and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a
strange huntsman, and asked if he could  offer him service. The king
said yes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should
come to him, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any
part of the district  or country . Then the huntsman promised to
procure as much game for him as he could possibly use at the royal
table. So he summoned all the huntsmen  together , and bade them go
out into the forest with him. And he went with them and made them
form a great circle, open at one end where he stationed himself, and
began to wish. Two hundred deer and more came running inside the
circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them. Then they were all
placed on sixty country carts, and drive n home to the king, and for
once he was able to deck his table with game, after having had none
at all for years. Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire
household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When they were all assembled together , he said to the huntsman: ‘As
you are so clever , you shall sit by me.’ He replied: ‘Lord King, your
majesty must excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.’  But the king
insisted on it, and said: ‘You shall sit by me,’ until he did it. Whilst
he was sitting there, he thought of his dearest mother , and wished
that one of the king’ s principal servants would begin to speak of her,
and would  ask how it was faring with the queen in the tower , and if
she were alive still, or had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish
than the marshal began, and said: ‘Your majesty , we live joyously
here, but how is the queen living in the tower? Is she still alive, or
has she died?’  But the king replied: ‘She let my dear son be torn to6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 99/201pieces by wild beasts; I will not have her named.’  Then the huntsman
arose and said: ‘Gracious lord father she is alive still, and I am her
son, and I was not carried away by wild beasts, but by that wretch
the old cook, who tore me from her arms when she was asleep, and
sprinkled her apron with the blood of a chicken.’  Thereupon he took
the dog with the golden collar , and said: ‘That is the wretch!’  and
caused live coals to be brought, and these the dog was compelled to
devour before the sight of all, until flames burst forth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he would like to see the dog
in his true shape, and wished him back into the form of the cook, in
which he stood immediately , with his white apron, and his knife by
his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passion, and ordered
him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman spoke
further and said: ‘Father , will you see the maiden who brought me up
so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it,
though her own life depended on it?’ The king replied: ‘Yes, I would
like to see her.’ The son said: ‘Most gracious father , I will show her
to you in the form of a beautiful flower ,’ and he thrust his hand into
his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal
table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to
equal it. Then the son said: ‘Now will I show her to you in her own
form,’  and wished that she might become a maiden, and she stood
there looking so beautiful that no painter could have made her look
more so. And the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the
tower , to fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when
she was led in she ate nothing, and said: ‘The gracious and merciful
God who has suppo rted me in the tower , will soon set me free.’  She
lived three days more, and then died happily , and when she was
buried, the two white doves which had brought her food to the tower ,
and were angels of heaven, followed her body and seated themselves
on her grave. The aged king ordered the cook to be torn in four
pieces, but grief consumed the king’ s own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden whom he had brought with him
as a flower in his pocket, and whether they are still alive or not, is
known to God.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever
Elsie. And when she had grown up her father said: ‘We will get her
married.’  ‘Yes,’ said the mother , ‘if only someone would come who
would have her.’ At length a man came from a distance and wooed
her, who was called Hans; but he stipul ated that Clever Elsie should
be really smart. ‘Oh,’  said the father , ‘she has plenty of good sense’;
and the mother said: ‘Oh, she can see the wind coming up the street,
and hear the flies coughing.’  ‘Well,’ said Hans, ‘if she is not really
smart, I won’ t have her.’ When they were sitting at dinner and had
eaten, the mother said: ‘Elsie, go into the cellar and fetch some beer.’
Then Clev er Elsie took the pitcher from the wall, went into the cellar ,
and tappe d the lid briskly as she went , so that the time might not
appear long. When she was below she fetched herself a chair , and set
it before the barrel so that she had no need to stoop, and did not hurt
her back or do herself any unexpected injury . Then she placed the
can before her, and turned the tap, and while the beer was running
she would  not let her eyes be idle, but looked up at the wall, and
after much peering here and there, saw a pick-axe exactly above her,
which the masons had accidentally left there. Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said: ‘If I get Hans, and we
have a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here
to draw beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’
Then she sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her
body , over the misfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs
waited for the drink, but Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the
woman said to the servant: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see
where Elsie is.’ The maid went and found her sitting in front of the
barrel, screaming loudly . ‘Elsie why do you weep?’  asked the maid. ‘Ah,’  she answered, ‘have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans, and
we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the
pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill him.’  Then said the
maid: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’  and sat down beside her and
began loudly to weep over the misfortun e. After a while, as the maid
did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the beer, the
man said to the boy: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see where
Elsie and the girl are.’ The boy went down, and there sat Clever Elsie
and the girl both weeping together . Then he asked: ‘Why are you
weeping?’  ‘Ah,’  said Elsie, ‘have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans,
and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the
pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’  Then said the boy: ‘What
a clever Elsie we have!’  and sat down by her, and likewise began to
howl loudly . Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not
return, the man said to the woman: ‘Just go down into the cellar and
see where Elsie is!’ The woman went down, and found all three in
the midst of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause;
then Elsie  told her also that her future child was to be killed by the
pick-axe, when it grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

have!’  and sat down and wept with them. The man upstairs waited a
short time, but as his wife did not come back and his thirst grew ever
greater , he said: ‘I must go into the cellar myself and see where Elsie
is.’ But when he got into the cellar , and they were all sitting together
crying, and he heard the reason, and that Elsie’ s child was the cause,
and the Elsie might perhaps bring one into the world some day, and
that he might be killed by the pick-axe , if he should happen to be
sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very time when it fell
down, he cried: ‘Oh, what a clever Elsie!’  and sat down, and likewise
wept with them. The bridegroom staye d upstairs alone for a long
time; then as no one would come back  he thought: ‘They must be
waiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are
about.’  When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming
and lamenting quite piteously , each out-doing the other . ‘What
misfortune has happened then?’  asked  he. ‘Ah, dear Hans,’  said
Elsie, ‘if we marry each other and have a child, and he is big, and we
perhaps send him here to draw somethin g to drink, then the pick-axe
which has been left up there might dash his brains out if it were to
fall down, so have we not reason to weep?’  ‘Come,’  said Hans, ‘more
understanding than that is not needed for my household, as you are
such a clever Elsie, I will have you,’  and seized her hand, took her
upstairs with him, and married her . After Hans had had her some time, he said: ‘Wife, I am going out
to work and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the
corn that we may have some bread.’  ‘Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.’
After Hans had gone away , she cooked herself some good broth and
took it into the field with her. When she came to the field she said to
herself: ‘What shall I do; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I
will eat first.’  Then she drank her cup of broth and when she was
fully satisfied, she once more said: ‘What shall I do? Shall I cut first,
or shall I sleep first? I will sleep first.’  Then she lay down among the
corn and fell asleep . Hans had been at home for a long time, but
Elsie did not come; then said he: ‘What a clever Elsie I have; she is
so industrious that she does not even come home to eat.’ But when
evening came and she still stayed away , Hans went out to see what
she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she was lying among the corn
asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought a fowler ’s net with
little bells and hung it round about her, and she still went on
sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door , and sat down in his
chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever Elsie
awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about her,
and the bells rang at each step whic h she took. Then she was
alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie
or not, and said: ‘Is it I, or is it not I?’ But she knew not what answer
to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought:
‘I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure to
know .’ She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then
she knocked at the window and cried: ‘Hans, is Elsie within?’  ‘Yes,’
answered Hans, ‘she is within.’  Hereupo n she was terrified, and said:
‘Ah, heav ens! Then  it is not I,’ and went to another door; but when
the people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and
she could get in nowhere.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard
for him three years,  without having been paid any wages. At last it
came into the man’ s head that he would not go on thus without pay
any longer ; so he went to his master , and said, ‘I have worked hard
for you a long time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to
have for my trouble.’  The farmer was a sad miser , and knew that his
man was very simp le-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave
him for every year’s service a penny . The poor fellow thought it was
a great deal of money to have, and said to himself, ‘Why should I
work hard, and live here on bad fare any longer? I can now travel
into the wide world , and make myself merry .’ With that he put his
money into his purse, and set out, roaming over hill and valley . As he jogged along  over the fields, singing and dancing, a little
dwarf met him, and asked him what made him so merry . ‘Why , what
should make me down-hearted?’  said he; ‘I am sound in health and
rich in purse, what should I care for? I have saved up my three years’
earnings and have it all safe in my pocket.’  ‘How much may it come
to?’ said the little man. ‘Full threepence,’  replied the countryman. ‘I
wish you would give them to me,’ said the other; ‘I am very poor.’
Then the man pitied him, and gave him all he had; and the little
dwarf said in return, ‘As you have such a kind honest heart, I will
grant you three wishes—one for every penny; so choose whatever
you like.’ Then the countryman rejoiced  at his good luck, and said, ‘I
like many things better than money: first, I will have a bow that will
bring down everything I shoot at; secondly , a fiddle that will set
everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly , I should
like that everyone should grant what I ask.’ The dwarf said he should
have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle, and went
his way . Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry
before, he was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he
met an old miser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost
twig sat a thrush singing away most joyfully . ‘Oh, what a pretty
bird!’  said the mise r; ‘I would give a great deal of money to have
such a one.’  ‘If that’s all,’ said the countryman, ‘I will soon bring it
down.’  Then he took up his bow, and down fell the thrush into the
bushes at the foot of the tree. The miser crept into the bush to find it;
but directly he had got into the middle , his companion took up his
fiddle and played away , and the miser began to dance and spring
about, capering higher and higher in the air. The thorns soon began
to tear his clothes till they all hung in rags about him, and he himself
was all scratched and wounded, so that the blood ran down. ‘Oh, for
heaven’ s sake!’  cried the miser , ‘Maste r! master! pray let the fiddle
alone. What have I done to deserve this?’ ‘Thou hast shaved many a
poor soul close enough,’  said the other ; ‘thou art only meeting thy
reward’: so he played up another tune. Then the miser began to beg
and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but he did not come6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

brisker and brisker , and the miser bid higher and higher , till at last he
offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse, and had
just gained by cheat ing some poor fellow . When the countryman saw
so much money , he said, ‘I will agree to your proposal.’  So he took
the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his
bargain. Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a
piteous plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge,
and serve his late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge,
and complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money , and
beaten him into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a
bow at his back and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge
sent out his officers  to bring up the accused wherever they should
find him; and he was soon caught and brought up to be tried. The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of his
money . ‘No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.’  said the
countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely , and cut the
matter short by ordering him of f to the gallows. So away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, ‘My
Lord Judge, grant me one last reques t.’ ‘Anything but thy life,’
replied the other . ‘No,’  said he, ‘I do not ask my life; only to let me
play upon my fiddle  for the last time.’  The miser cried out, ‘Oh, no! no!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"for heaven’ s sake don’t listen to him! don’t listen to him!’  But
the judge said, ‘It is only this once, he will soon have done.’  The fact
was, he could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf ’s third
gift. Then the miser said, ‘Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity’s sake.’
But the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the
first note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering,
and no one could hold the miser . At the second note the hangman let
his prisone r go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the
first bar of the tune, all were dancing  together—judge, court, and
miser , and all the people who had followed to look on. At first the
thing was merry and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a
while, and there seemed to be no end of playing or dancing, they
began to cry out, and beg him to leave off; but he stopped not a whit
the more for their entreaties, till the judge not only gave him his life,
but promised to return him the hundred florins. Then he called to the miser , and said, ‘Tell us now, you vagabond,
where you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,’
‘I stole it,’ said the miser in the presence of all the people; ‘I
acknowledge that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly .’ Then the
countryman stopped  his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at
the gallows.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

The wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end
drew nigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said,
‘Always be a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch
over you.’  Soon afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was
buried in the garden; and the little girl went every day to her grave
and wept, and was always good and kind to all about her. And the
snow fell and sprea d a beautiful white covering over the grave; but
by the time the spring came, and the sun had melted it away again,
her father had married another wife.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"This new wife had two
daughters of her own, that she brought home with her; they were fair
in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time for the poor
little girl. ‘What does the good-for -nothing want in the parlour?’  said
they; ‘they  who would eat bread should  first earn it; away with the
kitchen-maid!’  Then  they took away her fine clothes, and gave her an
old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her into the
kitchen. There she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before
daylight, to bring the water , to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that, the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed
at her. In the evening  when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down
on, but was made to lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of
course, made her always dusty and dirty , they called her Ashputtel. It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked
his wife’ s daughters  what he should bring them. ‘Fine clothes,’  said
the first; ‘Pearls and diamonds,’  cried the second. ‘Now , child,’  said
he to his own daugh ter, ‘what will you have?’  ‘The first twig, dear
father , that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come
homewards,’  said she. Then he bough t for the first two the fine
clothes and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way
home, as he rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against
him, and almost pushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it
away; and when he got home he gave it to his daughter . Then she
took it, and went to her mother ’s grave and planted it there; and cried
so much that it was watered with her tears; and there it grew and
became a fine tree. Three times every day she went to it and cried;
and soon a little bird came and built its nest upon the tree, and talked
with her, and watche d over her, and brought her whatever she wished
for. Now it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was
to last three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to
choose a bride for himself. Ashputtel’ s two sisters were asked to
come; so they called her up, and said, ‘Now , comb our hair, brush
our shoes, and tie our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the
king’ s feast.’  Then she did as she was told; but when all was done
she could not help crying, for she thought to herself, she should so
have liked  to have gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

who have nothing to wear , no clothes at all, and who cannot even
dance—you want to go to the ball?","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"And when she kept on begging,
she said at last, to get rid of her, ‘I will throw this dishful of peas into
the ash-heap, and if in two hours’  time you have picked them all out,
you shall go to the feast too.’
Then she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little
maiden ran out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:
 ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,
  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly! Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,
  Hither, hither, haste away! One and all come help me, quick! Haste ye, haste ye!—pick, pick, pick!’
Then first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window;
next came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds
under heav en, chirpi ng and fluttering in: and they flew down into the
ashes. And the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work,
pick, pick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and
among them all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it
into a dish but left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the
work was quite done, and all flew out again at the windows. Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother , overjoyed at the
thought that now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, ‘No,
no! you slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not
go.’ And when Ashputtel begged very hard to go, she said, ‘If you
can in one hour’s time pick two of those dishes of peas out of the
ashes, you shall go too.’ And thus she thought she should at least get
rid of her . So she shook two dishes of peas into the ashes. But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the
house, and cried out as before:
 ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,
  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly! Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,
  Hither, hither, haste away! One and all come help me, quick! Haste ye, haste ye!—pick, pick, pick!’
Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next
came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under
heaven, chirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the
ashes; and the little doves put their head s down and set to work, pick,
pick, pick; and then the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put
all the good grain into the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half
an hour’s time all was done, and out they flew again. And then
Ashputtel took the dishes to her mother , rejoicing to think that she
should now go to the ball. But her mother said, ‘It is all of no use,
you canno t go; you have no clothes, and cannot dance, and you
would only put us to shame’: and off she went with her two
daughters to the ball. Now when  all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went
sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:
 ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,
  Gold and silver over me!’6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 106/201Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold
and silver  dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put
them on, and follow ed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know
her, and thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine
and beautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of
Ashputtel, taking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt. The king’ s son soon  came up to her, and took her by the hand and
danced with her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but
when anyo ne else came to ask her to dance, he said, ‘This lady is
dancing with me.’
Thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted
to go home: and the king’ s son said, ‘I shall go and take care of you
to your home’; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden
lived. But she slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards
home; and as the prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-
house and shut the door. Then he waited till her father came home,
and told him that the unknown maiden, who had been at the feast,
had hid herself in the pigeon-house. But when they had broken open
the door they found no one within; and as they came back into the
house, Ashputtel was lying, as she always did, in her dirty frock by
the ashes, and her dim little lamp was burning in the chimney . For
she had run as quickly as she could through the pigeon-house and on
to the hazel-tree, and had there taken off her beautiful clothes, and
put them beneath the tree, that the bird might carry them away , and
had lain down again amid the ashes in her little grey frock. The next day when  the feast was again held, and her father ,
mother , and sisters were gone, Ashputte l went to the hazel-tree, and
said:
 ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,
  Gold and silver over me!’
And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she
had worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball,
everyone wondered at her beauty: but the king’ s son, who was
waiting for her, took her by the hand, and danced with her; and when
anyone asked her to dance, he said as before, ‘This lady is dancing
with me.’
When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’ s son
followed here as before, that he might see into what house she went:
but she sprang away  from him all at once into the garden behind her
father ’s house. In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe
fruit; and Ashputtel,  not knowing wher e to hide herself, jumped up
into it without being  seen. Then the king’ s son lost sight of her, and
could not find out where she was gone, but waited till her father
came home, and said to him, ‘The unknown lady who danced with
me has slipped away , and I think she must have sprung into the pear-
tree.’  The father thought to himself, ‘Can it be Ashputtel?’  So he had
an axe brought; and they cut down the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into the kitchen, there lay Ashputtel
among the ashes; for she had slipped down on the other side of the
tree, and carried her beautiful clothes back to the bird at the hazel-
tree, and then put on her little grey frock.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 107/201The third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone,
she went again into the garden, and said:
 ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,
  Gold and silver over me!’
Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the
former one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she
came to the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty:
and the king’ s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone
else asked her to dance, he said, ‘This lady is my partner , sir.’
When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’ s son
would go with her, and said to himself, ‘I will not lose her this time’;
but, however , she again slipped away from him, though in such a
hurry that she dropped her left golden slipper upon the stairs. The prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his
father , and said, ‘I will take for my wife the lady that this golden
slipper fits.’ Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they
had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden
slipper .","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was,
and wanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe
could not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for
her. Then the mothe r gave her a knife, and said, ‘Never mind, cut it
off; when you are queen you will not care about toes; you will not
want to walk.’  So the silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus
squeezed on the shoe, and went to the king’ s son. Then he took her
for his bride, and set her beside him on his horse, and rode away with
her homewards. But on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that
Ashputtel had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:
 ‘Back again! back again!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"look to the shoe! The shoe is too small, and not made for you! Prince!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"prince! look again for thy bride,
  For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’
Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by
the blood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So
he turned his horse round, and brough t the false bride back to her
home, and said, ‘This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and
put on the slipper .’ Then she went into the room and got her foot into
the shoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother
squeezed it in till the blood came, and took her to the king’ s son: and
he set her as his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with
her. But when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still,
and sang:
 ‘Back again! back again!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

Then he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much
from the shoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned
his horse and brought her also back again. ‘This is not the true
bride,’  said he to the father; ‘have you no other daughters?’  ‘No,’  said6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

wife; I am sure she cannot be the bride.’  The prince told him to send
her. But the mother said, ‘No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not
dare to show herself.’  However , the prince would have her come; and
she first washed her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to
him, and he reached her the golden slipper . Then she took her clumsy
shoe off her left foot, and put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her
as if it had been made for her. And when he drew near and looked at
her face he knew her, and said, ‘This is the right bride.’  But the
mother and both the sisters were frightened, and turned pale with
anger as he took Ashputtel on his horse, and rode away with her. And
when they came to the hazel-tree, the white dove sang:

A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom
through all the land. Nothing was hidde n from him, and it seemed as
if news of the most secret things was brought to him through the air.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"But he had a strange custom; every day after dinner , when the table
was cleare d, and no one else was present, a trusty servant had to
bring him one more dish. It was covered, however , and even the
servant did not know what was in it, neither did anyone know , for the
king never took of f the cover to eat of it until he was quite alone. This had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who
took away  the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could
not help carrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully
locked the door, he lifted up the cover , and saw a white snake lying
on the dish. But when he saw it he could not deny himself the
pleasure of tasting it, so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it touched his tongue than he heard a strange
whispering of little voices outside his window . He went and listened,
and then noticed that it was the sparrows who were chattering
together , and telling one another of all kinds of things which they
had seen in the fields and woods. Eating the snake had given him
power of understanding the language of animals. Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most
beautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty
servant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the
man to be brought before him, and threa tened with angry words that
unless he could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself
should be looked upon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared
his innocence; he was dismissed with no better answer .","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took
thought how to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks
were sitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and,
whilst they were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they
were having a confidential conversation together . The servant stood
by and listened. They were telling one another of all the places where
they had been wadd ling about all the morning, and what good food
they had found; and one said in a pitiful  tone: ‘Something lies heavy
on my stomach; as I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay
under the queen’ s window .’ The servant at once seized her by the
neck, carried her to the kitchen, and said to the cook: ‘Here is a fine
duck; pray, kill her.’ ‘Yes,’ said the cook, and weighed her in his
hand; ‘she has spared no trouble to fatten herself, and has been
waiting to be roasted long enough.’  So he cut off her head, and as she
was being dressed for the spit, the queen’ s ring was found inside her . The servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to
make amends for the wrong, allowed  him to ask a favour , and
promised him the best place in the court that he could wish for. The
servant refused everything, and only asked for a horse and some6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

a little. When his request was granted he set out on his way, and one
day came to a pond, where he saw three fishes caught in the reeds
and gaspin g for water . Now , though it is said that fishes are dumb, he
heard them  lamenting that they must perish so miserably , and, as he
had a kind heart, he got off his horse and put the three prisoners back
into the water. They  leapt with delight, put out their heads, and cried
to him: ‘W e will remember you and repay you for saving us!’
He rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a
voice in the sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king
complain: ‘Why cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our
bodies? That stupid horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading
down my people without mercy!’  So he turned on to a side path and
the ant-kin g cried out to him: ‘We will remember you—one good
turn deserves another!’
The path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens
standing by their nest, and throwing out their young ones. ‘Out with
you, you idle, good-for -nothing creatures!’  cried they; ‘we cannot
find food for you any longer; you are big enough, and can provide
for yourselves.’  But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground,
flapping their wings, and crying: ‘Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves, and yet we cannot fly! What can we do,
but lie here and starve?’  So the good  young fellow alighted and
killed his horse with his sword, and gave it to them for food. Then
they came hopping up to it, satisfied their hunger , and cried: ‘We will
remember you—one good turn deserves another!’
And now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a
long way, he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd
in the streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: ‘The
king’ s daughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must
perform a hard task, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his
life.’ Many had already made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless
when the youth saw the king’ s daughter  he was so overcome by her
great beauty that he forgot all danger , went before the king, and
declared himself a suitor . So he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it,
before his eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from
the bottom of the sea, and added: ‘If you come up again without it
you will be thrown in again and again until you perish amid the
waves.’  All the people grieved for the handsome youth; then they
went away , leaving him alone by the sea. He stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when
suddenly he saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they
were the very fishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle
held a mussel in its mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth’ s
feet, and when he had taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold
ring in the shell. Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that
he would grant him the promised reward.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal
in birth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another
task. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands

grain be wanting.’
The youth sat down  in the garden and considered how it might be
possible to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there
he sat sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led
to death. But as soon  as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden
he saw all the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a
single grain was missing. The ant-king had come in the night with
thousands and thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by
great industry picked up all the millet- seed and gathered them into
the sacks. Presently the king’ s daughter herself came down into the garden,
and was amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had
given him. But she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said:
‘Although he has performed both the tasks, he shall not be my
husband until he had brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.’  The
youth did not know where the Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and
would have gone on for ever, as long as his legs would carry him,
though he had no hope of finding it. After he had wandered through
three kingdoms, he came one evening to a wood, and lay down under
a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in the branches, and a golden
apple fell into his hand. At the same time three ravens flew down to
him, perched themselves upon his knee , and said: ‘We are the three
young ravens whom you saved from starving; when we had grown
big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple, we flew over
the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life stands, and
have brought you the apple.’  The youth, full of joy, set out
homewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king’ s beautiful
daughter , who had now no more excuse s left to make. They cut the
Apple of Life in two and ate it togethe r; and then her heart became
full of love for him, and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a

devour you all—skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often
disguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice
and his black feet.’  The kids said: ‘Dear mother , we will take good
care of ourselves; you may go away without any anxiety .’ Then the
old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind. It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and
called: ‘Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has
brought something back with her for each of you.’  But the little kids
knew that it was the wolf, by the rough voice. ‘We will not open the
door,’ cried they, ‘you are not our mother . She has a soft, pleasant
voice, but your voice is rough; you are the wolf!’  Then the wolf went
away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate
this and made his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at
the door of the house, and called: ‘Open the door, dear children, your
mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of
you.’  But the wolf had laid his black paws against the window , and
the childre n saw them and cried: ‘We will not open the door, our
mother has not black feet like you: you are the wolf!’  Then the wolf
ran to a baker and said: ‘I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over
them for me.’ And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to
the miller and said:  ‘Strew some white  meal over my feet for me.’
The miller  thought to himself: ‘The wolf wants to deceive someone,’
and refused; but the wolf said: ‘If you will not do it, I will devour
you.’  Then  the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind. So now the wretch  went for the third time to the house-door ,
knocked at it and said: ‘Open the door for me, children, your dear
little mother has come home, and has brought every one of you
something back from the forest with her.’ The little kids cried: ‘First
show us your paws that we may know if you are our dear little
mother .’ Then he put his paws in through the window and when the
kids saw that they were white, they belie ved that all he said was true,
and opened the door. But who should come in but the wolf! They
were terrified and wanted to hide themselves. One sprang under the
table, the second into the bed, the third into the stove, the fourth into
the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth under the washing-
bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But the wolf found them
all, and used no great ceremony; one after the other he swallowed
them down his throa t. The youngest, who was in the clock-case, was
the only one he did not find. When the wolf had satisfied his appetite6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards the old goat
came home again from the forest. Ah!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"what a sight she saw there! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches
were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the
quilts and pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children,
but they were nowhere to be found. She called them one after
another by name, but no one answered. At last, when she came to the
youngest, a soft voice cried: ‘Dear mother , I am in the clock-case.’
She took the kid out, and it told her that the wolf had come and had
eaten all the others. Then you may imagine how she wept over her
poor children. At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with
her. When they came to the meadow , there lay the wolf by the tree
and snored  so loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on
every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his
gorged belly . ‘Ah, heavens,’  she said, ‘is it possible that my poor
children whom he has swallowed down for his supper , can be still
alive?’  Then the kid had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle
and thread, and the goat cut open the monster ’s stomach, and hardly
had she made one cut, than one little kid thrust its head out, and
when she had cut farther , all six spran g out one after another , and
were all still alive, and had suffered no injury whatever , for in his
greediness the monster had swallowed them down whole. What
rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother , and jumped
like a tailor at his wedding. The mother , however , said: ‘Now go and
look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast’ s stomach
with them  while he is still asleep.’  Then the seven kids dragged the
stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this
stomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in
the greate st haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never
once stirred. When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his
legs, and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty , he
wanted to go to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to
move about, the stones in his stomach knocked against each other
and rattled. Then cried he:
 ‘What rumbles and tumbles
  Against my poor bones? I thought ‘twas six kids,
  But it feels like big stones.’
And when  he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink,
the heavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably . When
the seven kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried
aloud: ‘The wolf is dead! The wolf is dead!’  and danced for joy
round about the well with their mother .6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

Two kings’  sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their
fortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so
that they could not return home again. Then their brother , who was a
little insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when
he had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who
was so young and simple, should try to travel through the world,
when they, who were so much wiser , had been unable to get on. However , they all set out on their journey together , and came at last
to an ant-h ill. The two elder brothers would have pulled it down, in
order to see how the poor ants in their fright would run about and
carry off their eggs. But the little dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things
enjoy themselves, I will not suf fer you to trouble them.’
So on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks
were swim ming about. The two brothe rs wanted to catch two, and
roast them. But the dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy
themselves, you shall not kill them.’  Next they came to a bees’-nest
in a hollow tree, and there was so much honey that it ran down the
trunk; and the two brothers wanted to light a fire under the tree and
kill the bees, so as to get their honey . But the dwarf held them back,
and said, ‘Let the pretty insects enjoy themselves, I cannot let you
burn them.’
At length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed
by the stables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of
marble, and no man was to be seen. Then they went through all the
rooms, till they came to a door on which  were three locks: but in the
middle of the door was a wicket, so that they could look into the next
room. There they saw a little grey old man sitting at a table; and they
called to him once or twice, but he did not hear: however , they called
a third time, and then he rose and came out to them. He said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful
table covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten
and drunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber . The next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble
table, where there were three tablets, containing an account of the
means by which the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet
said: ‘In the wood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging
to the king’ s daughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing
by set of sun, he who seeks them will be turned into marble.’
The eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day:
but the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he
was turned into stone as the tablet had foretold. The next day the second brother undertook the task; but he
succeeded no better than the first; for he could only find the second
hundred of the pearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone. At last came the little dwarf ’s turn; and he looked in the moss; but
it was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!—so he6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

ants (whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand
ants; and it was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid
them in a heap. The secon d tablet said: ‘The key of the princess’ s bed-chamber
must be fished up out of the lake.’  And as the dwarf came to the
brink of it, he saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved
swimming about; and they dived down and soon brought in the key
from the bottom. The third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest
and the best of the king’ s three daughters. Now they were all
beautiful, and all exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had
eaten a piece of sugar , the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a
spoonful of honey; so he was to guess which it was that had eaten the
honey . Then came the quee n of the bees, who had been saved by the little
dwarf from the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she
sat upon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the
dwarf knew which was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and
all who had been turned into stones awoke, and took their proper
forms. And the dwarf married the youngest and the best of the
princesses, and was king after her father ’s death; but his two brothers
married the other two sisters.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

There was once a shoemaker , who worked very hard and was very
honest: but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all
he had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one
pair of shoes. Then he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day,
meaning to rise early in the morning to his work.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"His conscience was
clear and his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably
to bed, left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the
morning after he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his
work; when, to his great wonder , there stood the shoes all ready
made, upon the table. The good man knew not what to say or think at
such an odd thing happening. He looked at the workmanship; there
was not one false stitch in the whole job; all was so neat and true,
that it was quite a masterpiece. The same  day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so
well that he willingl y paid a price higher than usual for them; and the
poor shoemaker , with the money , bough t leather enough to make two
pairs more . In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early ,
that he might get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all
the trouble, for when he got up in the morning the work was done
ready to his hand. Soon in came buyers, who paid him handsomely
for his goods, so that he bought leather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight and found it done in the
morning, as before; and so it went on for some time: what was got
ready in the evening was always done  by daybreak, and the good
man soon became thriving and well of f again. One evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were
sitting over the fire chatting together , he said to her, ‘I should like to
sit up and watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and
does my work for me.’ The wife liked the thought; so they left a light
burning, and hid themselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain
that was hung up there, and watched what would happen. As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs;
and they sat themsel ves upon the shoem aker’s bench, took up all the
work that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers,
stitching and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the
shoemaker was all wonder , and could not take his eyes off them. And
on they went, till the job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready
for use upon the table. This was long before daybreak; and then they
bustled away as quick as lightning. The next day the wife said to the shoemaker . ‘These little wights
have made  us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them
a good turn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they
do; and indeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their
backs to keep off the cold. I’ll tell you what, I will make each of6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

the bar gain; and do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.’
The thought pleased the good cobbl er very much; and one
evening, when all the things were ready , they laid them on the table,
instead of the work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid
themselves, to watch what the little elves would do. About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped
round the room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but
when they saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and
chuckled, and seemed mightily delighted. Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and
danced and capered  and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at
last they danced out at the door , and away over the green. The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well
with them from that time forward, as long as they lived.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

Long, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich
man with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly ,
but sorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they
desire to have one, that the wife prayed  for it day and night, but still
they remained childless. In front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper -
tree. One winter ’s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some
apples, and as she was peeling them, she cut her finger , and the blood
fell on the snow . ‘Ah,’  sighed the woman heavily , ‘if I had but a
child, as red as blood and as white as snow ,’ and as she spoke the
words, her heart grew light within her, and it seemed to her that her
wish was granted, and she returned to the house feeling glad and
comforted. A month passed, and the snow had all disappeared; then
another month went  by, and all the earth was green. So the months
followed one another , and first the trees budded in the woods, and
soon the green branches grew thickly  intertwined, and then the
blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife stood under the juniper -
tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her heart leaped for joy,
and she was so overcome with her happiness, that she fell on her
knees. Presently the fruit became round  and firm, and she was glad
and at peace; but when they were fully  ripe she picked the berries
and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill. A little while
later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping. ‘If I die, bury
me under the junipe r-tree.’  Then she felt comforted and happy again,
and before another month had passed she had a little child, and when
she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy was
so great that she died. Her husba nd buried  her under the juniper -tree, and wept bitterly
for her. By degrees,  however , his sorrow  grew less, and although at
times he still grieved  over his loss, he was able to go about as usual,
and later on he married again. He now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife
was a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow . The
mother loved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her
and then looked at the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would
always stand in the way of her own child, and she was continually
thinking how she could get the whole of the property for her. This
evil thought took possession of her more and more, and made her
behave very unkindl y to the boy. She drove him from place to place
with cuffings and buffetings, so that the poor child went about in
fear, and had no peace from the time he left school to the time he
went back. One day the little daughter came running to her mother in the
store-room, and said, ‘Mother , give me an apple.’  ‘Yes, my child,’
said the wife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the
chest had a very heavy lid and a lar ge iron lock.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 119/201‘Mother ,’ said the little daughter again, ‘may not brother have one
too?’  The mother was angry at this, but she answered, ‘Yes, when he
comes out of school.’
Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and
it seemed as if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the
apple out of her little daughter ’s hand, and said, ‘You shall not have
one before your brother .’ She threw the apple into the chest and shut
it to. The little boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made
her say kindly to him, ‘My son, will you have an apple?’  but she
gave him a wicked look. ‘Mother ,’ said the boy, ‘how dreadful you
look! Yes, give me an apple.’  The thought came to her that she would
kill him. ‘Come with me,’ she said, and she lifted up the lid of the
chest; ‘take one out for yourself.’  And as he bent over to do so, the
evil spirit urged her, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the
little boy’s head. Then she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought
of what she had done. ‘If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I
did it,’ she thought. So she went upstairs to her room, and took a
white hand kerchief out of her top drawer; then she set the boy’s head
again on his should ers, and bound it with the handkerchief so that
nothing could be seen, and placed him on a chair by the door with an
apple in his hand. Soon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was
stirring a pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, ‘Mother ,
brother is sitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks
so pale; and when I asked him to give me the apple, he did not
answer , and that frightened me.’
‘Go to him again,’  said her mother , ‘and if he does not answer ,
give him a box on the ear.’ So little Marleen went, and said, ‘Brother ,
give me that apple,’  but he did not say a word; then she gave him a
box on the ear, and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this,
that she ran crying and screaming to her mother . ‘Oh!’  she said, ‘I
have knoc ked off brother ’s head,’  and then she wept and wept, and
nothing would stop her . ‘What have you done!’ said her mother , ‘but no one must know
about it, so you must keep silence; what  is done can’t be undone; we
will make  him into puddings.’  And she took the little boy and cut
him up, made him into puddings, and put him in the pot. But
Marleen stood looking on, and wept and wept, and her tears fell into
the pot, so that there was no need of salt. Presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he
asked, ‘Where is my son?’  The mother said nothing, but gave him a
large dish of black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing. The father again asked, ‘Where is my son?’
‘Oh,’  answered the wife, ‘he is gone into the country to his
mother ’s great uncle; he is going to stay there some time.’
‘What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to
me!’
‘Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away
quite six weeks; he is well looked after there.’
‘I feel very unhappy about it,’ said the husband, ‘in case it should
not be all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.’6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

why do you weep? Brother will soon be back.’  Then he asked his
wife for more pudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the
table.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief
out of her bottom drawer , and in it she wrapped all the bones from
under the table and carried them outside, and all the time she did
nothing but weep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the
juniper -tree, and she had no sooner done so, then all her sadness
seemed to leave her, and she wept no more. And now the juniper -tree
began to move, and the branches waved backwards and forwards,
first away from one another , and then together again, as it might be
someone clapping their hands for joy. After this a mist came round
the tree, and in the midst of it there was a burning as of fire, and out
of the fire there flew a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air,
singing magnificently , and when it could no more be seen, the
juniper -tree stood there as before, and the silk handkerchief and the
bones were gone. Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother
were still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down
cheerfully to the table and ate. The bird flew away  and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and
began to sing:
 ‘My mother killed her little son;
  My father grieved when I was gone;
  My sister loved me best of all;
  She laid her kerchief over me,
  And took my bones that they might lie
  Underneath the juniper-tree
  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’
The goldsm ith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he
heard the song of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that
he got up and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of
his slippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper
on one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and
still held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood
gazing up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on
the street. ‘Bird,’  he said, ‘how beautifully you sing! Sing me that song
again.’
‘Nay ,’ said the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that
gold chain, and I will sing it you again.’
‘Here is the chain, take it,’ said the goldsmith. ‘Only sing me that
again.’
The bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and
then he alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:
 ‘My mother killed her little son;
  My father grieved when I was gone;

The shoem aker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his
shirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his
hand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun. ‘Bird,’  he said, ‘how  beautifully you sing!’  Then he called through
the door to his wife: ‘Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look
at it and hear how beautifully it sings.’  Then he called his daughter
and the children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran
up the street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its
red and green feath ers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes
like two bright stars in its head. ‘Bird,’  said the shoemaker , ‘sing me that song again.’
‘Nay ,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; you
must give me something.’
‘Wife,’ said the man, ‘go into the garret; on the upper shelf you
will see a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.’ The wife went in and
fetched the shoes. ‘There, bird,’  said the shoemaker , ‘now sing me that song again.’
The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and
then he went back to the roof and sang:
 ‘My mother killed her little son;
  My father grieved when I was gone;
  My sister loved me best of all;
  She laid her kerchief over me,

When he had finishe d, he flew away . He had the chain in his right
claw and the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and
the mill went ‘Click  clack, click clack,  click clack.’  Inside the mill
were twenty of the miller ’s men hewing a stone, and as they went
‘Hick hack, hick hack, hick hack,’  the mill went ‘Click clack, click
clack, click clack.’
The bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:

"‘Bird,’  he said, ‘what a beautiful song that is you sing! Let me hear
it too; sing it again.’
‘Nay ,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; give me
that millstone, and I will sing it again.’
‘If it belonged to me alone,’  said the man, ‘you should have it.’
‘Yes, yes,’  said the others: ‘if he will sing again, he can have it.’
The bird came down , and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up
the stone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole
and took the stone round his neck like a collar , and flew back with it
to the tree and sang—

roof. ‘I do feel so happy ,’ said the father , ‘and how beautifully the sun

corner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears. The bird now flew to the juniper -tree and began singing:

so magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a
delicious scent of spice in the air!’
  My sister loved me best of all;
then little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed. ‘I must go outside and see the bird nearer ,’ said the man. ‘Ah, do not go!’ cried the wife. ‘I feel as if the whole house were
in flames!’
But the man went out and looked at the bird. She laid her kerchief over me,
 And took my bones that they might lie
 Underneath the juniper-tree
 Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’
With that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the
man’ s neck, so that it fitted him exactly . He went inside, and said, ‘See, what a splendid bird that is; he has
given me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.’
But the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor ,
and her cap fell from her head. Then the bird began again:
 ‘My mother killed her little son;
‘Ah me!’ cried the wife, ‘if I were but a thousand feet beneath the
earth, that I might not hear that song.’
  My father grieved when I was gone;
then the woman fell down again as if dead. My sister loved me best of all;
‘Well,’ said little Marleen, ‘I will go out too and see if the bird will
give me anything.’
So she went out. She laid her kerchief over me,
  And took my bones that they might lie
and he threw down the shoes to her ,
  Underneath the juniper-tree
  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’
And she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the
shoes and danced and jumped about in them. ‘I was so miserable,’
she said, ‘when I came out, but that has all passed away; that is
indeed a splendid bird, and he has given me a pair of red shoes.’
The wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like
flames of fire. ‘Then I will go out too,’ she said, ‘and see if it will
lighten my misery , for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.’
But as she crossed  the threshold, crash!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

There were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich
and the other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better
himself; so, pulling off his red coat, he became a gardener , and dug
his ground well, and sowed turnips.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"When the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the
rest; and it kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would
never cease growing ; so that it might have been called the prince of
turnips for there never was such a one seen before, and never will
again. At last it was so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could
hardly draw it; and the gardener knew not what in the world to do
with it, nor whether it would be a blessing or a curse to him. One day
he said to himself, ‘What shall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no
more than another; and for eating, the little turnips are better than
this; the best thing perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a
mark of respect.’
Then he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave
it to the king. ‘What a wonderful thing!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"’ said the king; ‘I have seen
many strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where
did you get the seed?","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a
true child of fortune .’ ‘Ah, no!’ answered  the gardener , ‘I am no child
of fortune; I am a poor soldier , who never could get enough to live
upon; so I laid aside  my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a brother , who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and
all the world knows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets
me.’
The king then took pity on him, and said, ‘You shall be poor no
longer . I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than
your brother .’ Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made
him so rich that his brother ’s fortune could not at all be compared
with his. When the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the
gardener so rich, he envied him sorely , and bethought himself how
he could contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However ,
he determined to manage more cleverly than his brother , and got
together a rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and
thought he must have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother
had receiv ed so much for only a turnip, what must his present be
worth? The king took the gift very graciously , and said he knew not what
to give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip;
so the soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with
him. When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his
rage and spite; and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and
he resolved to kill his brother . So he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them
where to lie in ambush, he went to his brother , and said, ‘Dear6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 126/201brother , I have found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and
share it between us.’ The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so
they went out together, and as they were travelling along, the
murderers rushed out upon him, bound him, and were going to hang
him on a tree. But whilst  they were getting all ready , they heard the trampling of
a horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their
prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up
by a cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away .","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Meantime he worked and worked away, till he made a hole large
enough to put out his head. When the horseman  came up, he proved to be a student, a merry
fellow , who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he
went. As soon as the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree,
he cried out, ‘Good morning! good morning to thee, my friend!’  The
student looked about everywhere; and seeing no one, and not
knowing where the voice came from, cried out, ‘Who calls me?’
Then the man in the tree answered, ‘Lift up thine eyes, for behold
here I sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned
great and wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the learning of
the school s is as empty air. A little longer , and I shall know all that
man can know , and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of
mankind. Here I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and
the stars; the laws that control the winds; the number of the sands on
the seasho re; the healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of
birds, and of precious stones. Wert thou but once here, my friend,
though wouldst feel and own the power of knowledge. The student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said,
‘Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive
to let me into the sack for a little while?’  Then the other answered, as
if very unwillingly , ‘A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou
wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet
an hour below , till I have learnt some little matters that are yet
unknown to me.’
So the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time
hung heavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend
forthwith, for his thirst for knowledge  was great. Then the other
pretended to give way, and said, ‘Thou must let the sack of wisdom
descend, by untying  yonder cord, and then thou shalt enter .’ So the
student let him down, opened the sack, and set him free. ‘Now then,’
cried he, ‘let me ascend quickly .’ As he began to put himself into the
sack heels  first, ‘Wait a while,’  said the gardener , ‘that is not the
way.’ Then he pushed him in head first, tied up the sack, and soon
swung up the searcher after wisdom dangling in the air. ‘How is it
with thee, friend?’  said he, ‘dost thou not feel that wisdom comes
unto thee? Rest there in peace, till thou art a wiser man than thou
wert.’
So saying , he trotted off on the student’ s nag, and left the poor
fellow to gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him
down.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

but he was stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father:
‘Hark you, my son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"You
must go from hence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated
master , who shall see what he can do with you.’  The youth was sent
into a strange town,  and remained a whole year with the master . At
the end of this time, he came home again, and his father asked:
‘Now , my son, what have you learnt?’  ‘Father , I have learnt what the
dogs say when they bark.’  ‘Lord have mercy on us!’ cried the father;
‘is that all you have learnt? I will send you into another town, to
another master.’ The youth was taken thither , and stayed a year with
this maste r likewise. When he came back the father again asked: ‘My
son, what have you learnt?’  He answere d: ‘Father , I have learnt what
the birds say.’ Then the father fell into a rage and said: ‘Oh, you lost
man, you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing; are you
not ashamed to appear before my eyes? I will send you to a third
master , but if you learn nothing this time also, I will no longer be
your father .’ The youth remained a whole year with the third master
also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired: ‘My
son, what have you learnt?’  he answer ed: ‘Dear father , I have this
year learn t what the frogs croak.’  Then  the father fell into the most
furious anger , sprang up, called his people thither , and said: ‘This
man is no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to
take him out into the forest, and kill him.’  They took him forth, but
when they should have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and
let him go, and they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they
might carry them to the old man as a token. The youth  wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress
where he begged for a night’ s lodging . ‘Yes,’ said the lord of the
castle, ‘if you will pass the night down there in the old tower , go
thither; but I warn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of
wild dogs, which bark and howl without stopping, and at certain
hours a man has to be given to them, whom they at once devour .’ The
whole district was in sorrow and dismay  because of them, and yet no
one could do anythi ng to stop this. The youth, however , was without
fear, and said: ‘Just let me go down to the barking dogs, and give me
something that I can throw to them; they will do nothing to harm
me.’ As he himself would have it so, they gave him some food for
the wild animals, and led him down to the tower . When he went
inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged their tails quite
amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and did not hurt
one hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of everyone,
he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of the
castle: ‘The dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why
they dwell there, and bring evil on the land. They are bewitched, and
are oblige d to watch over a great treasure which is below in the
tower , and they can have no rest until it is taken away , and I have6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

who heard  this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would

brought a chest full of gold out with him.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

great doub t among the cardinals as to whom they should appoint as
his succes sor. They at length agreed that the person should be chosen
as pope who should  be distinguished by some divine and miraculous
token. And just as that was decided on, the young count entered into
the churc h, and suddenly two snow-white doves flew on his
shoulders and remained sitting there. The ecclesiastics recognized
therein the token from above, and asked  him on the spot if he would

It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought
to herself:  ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed
in the world,’ she spoke to him in a frien dly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr
Fox, how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in
these hard times?’  The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at
the cat from head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether
he would give any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched
beard-cleaner , you piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter , what can
you be thinking of? Have you the cheek  to ask how I am getting on?","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

a tree and save myself.’  ‘Is that all?’ said the fox. ‘I am master of a
hundred arts, and have into the bargain a sackful of cunning. You
make me sorry for you; come with me, I will teach you how people
get away from the hounds.’  Just then came a hunter with four dogs. The cat sprang nimb ly up a tree, and sat down at the top of it, where
the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your sack, Mr

‘Dear children,’  said a poor man to his four sons, ‘I have nothing
to give you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin by learning some craft or another , and see how you can get
on.’ So the four brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and
their little bundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father
goodbye, went all out at the gate together . When they had got on
some way they came to four crossways , each leading to a different
country . Then the eldest said, ‘Here we must part; but this day four
years we will come back to this spot, and in the meantime each must
try what he can do for himself.’
So each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a
man met him, and asked him where he was going, and what he
wanted. ‘I am going to try my luck in the world, and should like to
begin by learning some art or trade,’  answered he. ‘Then,’  said the
man, ‘go with me, and I will teach you to become the cunningest
thief that ever was.’  ‘No,’  said the other , ‘that is not an honest
calling, and what can one look to earn by it in the end but the
gallows?’  ‘Oh!’  said the man, ‘you need not fear the gallows; for I
will only teach you to steal what will be fair game: I meddle with
nothing but what no one else can get or care anything about, and
where no one can find you out.’ So the young man agreed to follow
his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever , that nothing could
escape him that he had once set his mind upon. The second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what
he was setting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow .","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"‘I
do not know yet,’ said he. ‘Then come with me, and be a star-gazer . It is a noble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you
understand the stars.’  The plan please d him much, and he soon
became such a skilful star-gazer , that when he had served out his
time, and wanted to leave his master , he gave him a glass, and said,
‘With this you can see all that is passing in the sky and on earth, and
nothing can be hidden from you.’
The third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and
taught him so well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very
clever in the craft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave
him a bow, and said, ‘Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will
be sure to hit.’
The young est brother likewise met a man who asked him what he
wished to do. ‘Would not you like,’  said he, ‘to be a tailor?’  ‘Oh, no!’
said the young man; ‘sitting cross-leg ged from morning to night,
working backwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never
suit me.’ ‘Oh!’ answ ered the man, ‘that is not my sort of tailoring;
come with me, and you will learn quite another kind of craft from
that.’  Not knowing what better to do, he came into the plan, and
learnt tailoring from the beginning; and when he left his master , he
gave him a needle, and said, ‘You can sew anything with this, be it as6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

seam will be seen.’
After the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four
brothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each
other , set off towar ds their father ’s home, where they told him all
that had happened to them, and how each had learned some craft.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Then, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very
high tree, the father  said, ‘I should like to try what each of you can
do in this way.’ So he looked up, and said to the second son, ‘At the
top of this tree there is a chaffinch’ s nest; tell me how many eggs
there are in it.’ The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said,
‘Five.’  ‘Now,’ said the father to the eldest son, ‘take away the eggs
without letting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them
know anything of what you are doing.’  So the cunning thief climbed
up the tree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under
the bird; and it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting
on at its ease.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Then the father took the eggs, and put one on each
corner of the table , and the fifth in the middle, and said to the
huntsman, ‘Cut all the eggs in two pieces at one shot.’  The huntsman
took up his bow, and at one shot struck all the five eggs as his father
wished. ‘Now comes your turn,’  said he to the young tailor; ‘sew the eggs
and the young birds  in them together again, so neatly that the shot
shall have  done them no harm.’  Then the tailor took his needle, and
sewed the eggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was
sent to take them back to the nest, and put them under the bird
without its knowing it. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them:
and in a few days they crawled out, and had only a little red streak
across their necks, where the tailor had sewn them together .","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"‘Well done, sons!’  said the old man; ‘you have made good use of
your time,  and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I
do not know which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might
soon come for you to turn your skill to some account!’
Not long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the
king’ s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the
king mour ned over his loss day and night, and made it known that
whoever brought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then
the four brothers said to each other , ‘Here is a chance for us; let us
try what we can do.’ And they agreed to see whether they could not
set the princess free. ‘I will soon find out where she is, however ,’
said the star-gazer , as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried
out, ‘I see her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy
the dragon  close by, guarding her.’ Then he went to the king, and
asked for a ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together
over the sea, till they came to the right place. There they found the
princess sitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the
dragon was lying asleep, with his head upon her lap. ‘I dare not
shoot at him,’  said the huntsman, ‘for I should kill the beautiful
young lady also.’  ‘Then I will try my skill,’  said the thief, and went
and stole her away from under the drago n, so quietly and gently that
the beast did not know it, but went on snoring. Then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards
the ship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

boat, and wanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the
huntsman took up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so
that he fell down dead. They were still not safe; for he was such a
great beast that in his fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim
in the open sea upon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle, and
with a few large stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat
down upon these, and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the
boat; and then tacked them together so quickly that the boat was
soon ready , and they then reached the ship and got home safe. When they had brought home the princess to her father , there was
great rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, ‘One of you shall
marry her, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.’
Then there  arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, ‘If
I had not found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no
use; therefore she ought to be mine.’  ‘Your seeing her would have
been of no use,’ said the thief, ‘if I had not taken her away from the
dragon; therefore she ought to be mine.’  ‘No, she is mine,’  said the
huntsman; ‘for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have
torn you and the princess into pieces.’  ‘And if I had not sewn the
boat together again,’  said the tailor , ‘you would all have been
drowned, therefore she is mine.’  Then the king put in a word, and
said, ‘Each of you is right; and as all cannot have the young lady, the
best way is for neither of you to have her: for the truth is, there is
somebody she likes a great deal better . But to make up for your loss,
I will give each of you, as a reward for his skill, half a kingdom.’  So
the brothe rs agreed that this plan would be much better than either
quarrelling or marrying a lady who had no mind to have them. And
the king then gave to each half a kingdom, as he had said; and they
lived very happily the rest of their days, and took good care of their
father; and somebod y took better care of the young lady, than to let
either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have her again.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

A merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a
journey; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he
should bring back for her. The eldest wished for pearls; the second
for jewels; but the third, who was called Lily, said, ‘Dear father ,
bring me a rose.’  Now it was no easy task to find a rose, for it was
the middle of winte r; yet as she was his prettiest daughter , and was
very fond of flowers, her father said he would try what he could do. So he kissed all three, and bid them goodbye. And when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls
and jewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain
for the rose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a
thing, the people laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought
roses grew  in snow . This grieved him very much, for Lily was his
dearest child; and as he was journeyi ng home, thinking what he
should bring her, he came to a fine castle; and around the castle was
a garden, in one half of which it seemed to be summer -time and in
the other half winter . On one side the finest flowers were in full
bloom, and on the other everything looked dreary and buried in the
snow . ‘A lucky hit!’ said he, as he called  to his servant, and told him
to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was there, and bring him away
one of the finest flowers. This done , they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a
fierce lion, and roared out, ‘Whoever has stolen my roses shall be
eaten up alive!’  Then the man said, ‘I knew not that the garden
belonged to you; can nothing save my life?’  ‘No!’  said the lion,
‘nothing, unless you undertake to give me whatever meets you on
your return home; if you agree to this, I will give you your life, and
the rose too for your daughter .’ But the man was unwilling to do so
and said, ‘It may be my youngest daugh ter, who loves me most, and
always runs to meet me when I go home.’  Then the servant was
greatly frightened, and said, ‘It may perhaps be only a cat or a dog.’
And at last the man yielded with a heavy heart, and took the rose;
and said he would give the lion whatev er should meet him first on
his return. And as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest
daughter , that met him; she came running, and kissed him, and
welcomed him home; and when she saw that he had brought her the
rose, she was still more glad. But her father began to be very
sorrowful, and to weep, saying, ‘Alas , my dearest child! I have
bought this flower at a high price, for I have said I would give you to
a wild lion; and when he has you, he will tear you in pieces, and eat
you.’  Then  he told her all that had happened, and said she should not
go, let what would happen. But she comforted him, and said, ‘Dear father , the word you have
given must be kept; I will go to the lion, and soothe him: perhaps he
will let me come safe home again.’6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 136/201The next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave
of her father , and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But the
lion was an enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions,
but in the evening they took their right forms again. And when Lily
came to the castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed
to marry him. The wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily
together a long time. The prince was only to be seen as soon as
evening came, and then he held his court; but every morning he left
his bride, and went away by himself, she knew not whither , till the
night came again. After some time he said to her, ‘Tomorrow there will be a great
feast in your father ’s house, for your eldest sister is to be married;
and if you wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither .’
Then she rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once
more, and set out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see
her, for they had thought her dead long since. But she told them how
happy she was, and stayed till the feast was over, and then went back
to the wood. Her second sister was soon after married, and when Lily was
asked to go to the wedding, she said to the prince, ‘I will not go
alone this time—yo u must go with me.’ But he would not, and said
that it would be a very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the
torch-light should fall upon him his enchantment would become still
worse, for he shou ld be changed into a dove, and be forced to
wander about the world for seven long years. However , she gave him
no rest, and said she would take care no light should fall upon him. So at last they set out together , and took with them their little child;
and she chose a large hall with thick walls for him to sit in while the
wedding-torches were lighted; but, unluckily , no one saw that there
was a crack in the door. Then the weddin g was held with great pomp,
but as the train came from the church, and passed with the torches
before the hall, a very small ray of light fell upon the prince. In a
moment he disappeared, and when his wife came in and looked for
him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her, ‘Seven years
must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but every now and
then I will let fall a white feather , that will show you the way I am
going; follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me free.’
This said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and
every now and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she
was to journey. Thus  she went roving on through the wide world, and
looked neither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for
seven years. Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that
the time was fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet
repose was still far off, for one day as she was travelling on she
missed the white feather , and when she lifted up her eyes she could
nowhere see the dove. ‘Now ,’ thought she to herself, ‘no aid of man
can be of use to me.’ So she went to the sun and said, ‘Thou shinest
everywhere, on the hill’s top and the valley’ s depth—hast thou
anywhere seen my white dove?’  ‘No,’  said the sun, ‘I have not seen
it; but I will give thee a casket—open  it when thy hour of need
comes.’
So she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and
when the moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, ‘Thou shinest6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 137/201through the night, over field and grove—hast thou nowhere seen my
white dove?’ ‘No,’  said the moon, ‘I cannot help thee but I will give
thee an egg—break it when need comes.’
Then she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew;
and she raised up her voice to it, and said, ‘Thou blowest through
every tree and under every leaf—hast thou not seen my white dove?’
‘No,’  said the night-wind, ‘but I will ask three other winds; perhaps
they have seen it.’ Then the east wind and the west wind came, and
said they too had not seen it, but the south wind said, ‘I have seen the
white dove—he has fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more
into a lion, for the seven years are passed away , and there he is
fighting with a drago n; and the dragon is an enchanted princess, who
seeks to separate him from you.’  Then  the night-wind said, ‘I will
give thee counsel. Go to the Red Sea; on the right shore stand many
rods—count them, and when thou comest to the eleventh, break it
off, and smite the dragon with it; and so the lion will have the
victory , and both of them will appear to you in their own forms.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Then
look round  and thou wilt see a griffin, winged like bird, sitting by the
Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved one as quickly as
possible, and he will carry you over the waters to your home. I will
also give thee this nut,’ continued the night-wind. ‘When you are
half-way over, throw it down, and out of the waters will immediately
spring up a high nut-tree on which the griffin will be able to rest,
otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole way;
if, therefo re, thou dost forget to throw down the nut, he will let you
both fall into the sea.’
So our poor wander er went forth, and found all as the night-wind
had said; and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon,
and the lion forthwith became a prince, and the dragon a princess
again. But no sooner was the princess released from the spell, than
she seized the princ e by the arm and sprang on to the griffin’s back,
and went of f carrying the prince away with her . Thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she
took heart and said, ‘As far as the wind blows, and so long as the
cock crow s, I will journey on, till I find him once again.’  She went
on for a long, long way, till at length she came to the castle whither
the princess had carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready ,
and she heard that the wedding was about to be held. ‘Heaven aid me
now!’  said she; and she took the casket that the sun had given her,
and found that within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So
she put it on, and went into the palace, and all the people gazed upon
her; and the dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether
it was to be sold. ‘Not for gold and silver .’ said she, ‘but for flesh and
blood.’  The princess asked what she meant, and she said, ‘Let me
speak with the bridegroom this night in his chamber , and I will give
thee the dress.’  At last the princess agreed, but she told her
chamberlain to give the prince a sleeping draught, that he might not
hear or see her. When evening came, and the prince had fallen
asleep, she was led into his chamber , and she sat herself down at his
feet, and said: ‘I have followed thee seven years.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"I have been to the
sun, the moon, and the night-wind, to seek thee, and at last I have
helped thee to overcome the dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite?’
But the prince all the time slept so soundly , that her voice only6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 138/201passed over him, and seemed like the whistling of the wind among
the fir -trees. Then poor Lily was led away , and forced to give up the golden
dress; and when she saw that there was no help for her, she went out
into a meadow , and sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she
bethought herself of the egg that the moon had given her; and when
she broke it, there ran out a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold,
that played about, and then nestled under the old one’s wings, so as
to form the most beautiful sight in the world. And she rose up and
drove them  before her, till the bride saw them from her window , and
was so pleased that she came forth and asked her if she would sell
the brood. ‘Not for gold or silver , but for flesh and blood: let me
again this evening speak with the bridegroom in his chamber , and I
will give thee the whole brood.’
Then the princess thought to betray her as before, and agreed to
what she asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked
the chamberlain why the wind had whis tled so in the night. And the
chamberlain told him all—how he had given him a sleeping draught,
and how a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber ,
and was to come again that night. Then the prince took care to throw
away the sleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to
tell him what woes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him
she had been, he knew his beloved wife’s voice, and sprang up, and
said, ‘You have awakened me as from a dream, for the strange
princess had thrown a spell around me, so that I had altogether
forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent you to me in a lucky hour .’
And they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and
seated themselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the
Red Sea. When they were half-way across Lily let the nut fall into
the water , and immediately a large nut-tree arose from the sea,
whereon the griffin rested for a while, and then carried them safely
home. There they found their child, now grown up to be comely and
fair; and after all their troubles they lived happily together to the end
of their days.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to
him: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would
give him nothing more to eat, and said, ‘I want you no longer , so
take yours elf off out of my stable; I shall not take you back again
until you are stronger than a lion.’  Then he opened the door and
turned him adrift. The poor horse was very melancholy , and wandered up and down
in the wood, seeking  some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently a fox met him: ‘What’ s the matter , my friend?’  said he,
‘why do you hang down your head and look so lonely and woe-
begone?’  ‘Ah!’  replied the horse, ‘justic e and avarice never dwell in
one house; my master has forgotten all that I have done for him so
many years, and because I can no longer work he has turned me
adrift, and says unless I become stronge r than a lion he will not take
me back again; what chance can I have of that? he knows I have
none, or he would not talk so.’
However , the fox bid him be of good cheer , and said, ‘I will help
you; lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be
dead.’  The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the
lion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, ‘A little way off
lies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent
meal of his carcas e.’ The lion was greatly pleased, and set off
immediately; and when they came to the horse, the fox said, ‘You
will not be able to eat him comfortabl y here; I’ll tell you what—I
will tie you fast to his tail, and then you can draw him to your den,
and eat him at your leisure.’
This advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for
the fox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his
legs together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength
he could not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox
clapped the horse on the shoulder , and said, ‘Jip! Dobbin! Jip!’ Then
up he sprang, and moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The
beast began to roar and bellow , till all the birds of the wood flew
away for fright; but the horse let him sing on, and made his way
quietly over the fields to his master ’s house.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"‘Here he is, master ,’ said he, ‘I have got the better of him’: and
when the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. ‘Thou shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.’ And so the
poor old horse had plenty to eat, and lived—till he died.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 140/201THE BLUE LIGHT
There was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had
served the king faithfully , but when the war came to an end could
serve no longer because of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him: ‘You may return to your home, I need you no
longer , and you will not receive any more money , for he only
receives wages who renders me service  for them.’  Then the soldier
did not know how to earn a living, went away greatly troubled, and
walked the whole day, until in the evening he entered a forest. When
darkness came on, he saw a light, which he went up to, and came to a
house wherein lived  a witch. ‘Do give me one night’ s lodging, and a
little to eat and drink,’ said he to her, ‘or I shall starve.’  ‘Oho!’  she
answered, ‘who gives anything to a run-away soldier? Yet will I be
compassionate, and take you in, if you will do what I wish.’  ‘What
do you wish?’  said the soldier . ‘That you should dig all round my
garden for me, tomorrow .’ The soldie r consented, and next day
laboured with all his strength, but could  not finish it by the evening. ‘I see well enough,’  said the witch, ‘that you can do no more today ,
but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for which you must
tomorrow chop me a load of wood, and chop it small.’  The soldier
spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch
proposed that he should stay one night more. ‘Tomorrow , you shall
only do me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is
an old dry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and
never goes out, and you shall bring it up again.’  Next day the old
woman took him to the well, and let him down in a basket. He found
the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him up again. She did
draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she stretched down
her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from him. ‘No,’  said
he, perceiving her evil intention, ‘I will not give you the light until I
am standing with both feet upon the ground.’  The witch fell into a
passion, let him fall again into the well, and went away . The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the
blue light went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw
very well that he could not escape death. He sat for a while very
sorrowfully , then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his
tobacco pipe, which was still half full. ‘This shall be my last
pleasure,’  thought he, pulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to
smoke. When the smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a
little black dwarf stood before him, and said: ‘Lord, what are your
commands?’  ‘What my commands are?’  replied the soldier , quite
astonished. ‘I must do everything you bid me,’ said the little man. ‘Good,’  said the soldier; ‘then in the first place help me out of this
well.’  The little man took him by the hand, and led him through an
under ground passag e, but he did not forget to take the blue light with
him. On the way the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch
had collected and hidden there, and the soldier took as much gold as
he could carry . When he was above, he said to the little man: ‘Now6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 141/201go and bind the old witch, and carry her before the judge.’  In a short
time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild tom-cat and
screaming frightfully . Nor was it long before the little man
reappeared. ‘It is all done,’  said he, ‘and the witch is already hanging
on the gallows. What further commands has my lord?’  inquired the
dwarf. ‘At this moment, none,’  answere d the soldier; ‘you can return
home, only be at hand immediately , if I summon you.’  ‘Nothing
more is needed than that you should light your pipe at the blue light,
and I will appear before you at once.’  Thereupon he vanished from
his sight. The soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to
the best inn, ordere d himself handsome clothes, and then bade the
landlord furnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was
ready and the soldier had taken posses sion of it, he summoned the
little black  manikin and said: ‘I have served the king faithfully , but
he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I want to take
my revenge.’  ‘What am I to do?’ asked the little man. ‘Late at night,
when the king’ s daughter is in bed, bring her here in her sleep, she
shall do servant’ s work for me.’ The manikin said: ‘That is an easy
thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is
discovered, you will fare ill.’ When twelve o’clock had struck, the
door sprang open, and the manikin carried in the princess. ‘Aha!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"are
you there? ’ cried the soldier , ‘get to your work at once! Fetch the
broom and sweep the chamber .’ When she had done this, he ordered
her to come to his chair , and then he stretched out his feet and said:
‘Pull off my boots,’  and then he threw them in her face, and made her
pick them  up again, and clean and brighten them. She, however , did
everything he bade her, without opposition, silently and with half-
shut eyes. When the first cock crowed, the manikin carried her back
to the royal palace, and laid her in her bed. Next morn ing when  the princess arose she went to her father , and
told him that she had had a very strange dream. ‘I was carried
through the streets with the rapidity of lightning,’  said she, ‘and
taken into a soldier ’s room, and I had to wait upon him like a
servant, sweep his room, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial
work. It was only a dream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had
done everything.’  ‘The dream may have  been true,’  said the king. ‘I
will give you a piece of advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and
make a small hole in the pocket, and then if you are carried away
again, they will fall out and leave a track in the streets.’  But unseen
by the king, the manikin was standing beside him when he said that,
and heard all. At night when the sleepin g princess was again carried
through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of her pocket, but
they made  no track, for the crafty manikin had just before scattered
peas in every street there was. And again the princess was compelled
to do servant’ s work until cock-crow . Next morn ing the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it
was all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking
up peas, and saying: ‘It must have rained peas, last night.’  ‘We must
think of something else,’  said the king; ‘keep your shoes on when
you go to bed, and before you come back from the place where you
are taken, hide one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.’ The
black manikin heard this plot, and at night when the soldier again6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 142/201ordered him to bring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him
that he knew of no expedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if
the shoe were found in the soldier ’s house it would go badly with
him. ‘Do what I bid you,’  replied the soldier , and again this third
night the princess was obliged to work like a servant, but before she
went away , she hid her shoe under the bed. Next morning the king had the entire town searched for his
daughter ’s shoe. It was found at the soldier ’s, and the soldier
himself, who at the entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate,
was soon brought back, and thrown into prison. In his flight he had
forgotten the most valuable things he had, the blue light and the gold,
and had only one ducat in his pocket. And now loaded with chains,
he was standing at the window of his dungeon, when he chanced to
see one of his comrades passing by. The soldier tapped at the pane of
glass, and when this man came up, said to him: ‘Be so kind as to
fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in the inn, and I will give
you a ducat for doing it.’ His comrade ran thither and brought him
what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone again, he lighted
his pipe and summoned the black manikin. ‘Have no fear,’ said the
latter to his master . ‘Go wheresoever they take you, and let them do
what they will, only take the blue light with you.’  Next day the
soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge
condemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a
last favour of the king. ‘What is it?’ asked the king. ‘That I may
smoke one more pipe on my way.’ ‘You may smoke three,’  answered
the king, ‘but do not imagine that I will spare your life.’ Then the
soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon
as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended , the manikin was there with
a small cudgel in his hand, and said: ‘What does my lord command?’
‘Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his constable, and
spare not the king who has treated me so ill.’ Then the manikin fell
on them like lightnin g, darting this way and that way, and whosoever
was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth, and did not
venture to stir again. The king was terrified; he threw himself on the
soldier ’s mercy , and merely to be allowe d to live at all, gave him his
kingdom for his own, and his daughter to wife.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

to run alone.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"One day the child was very troublesome, and the
mother could not quiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient,
and seein g the ravens flying round the castle, she opened the
window , and said: ‘I wish you were a raven and would fly away , then
I should have a little peace.’  Scarcely were the words out of her
mouth, when the child in her arms was turned into a raven, and flew
away from her through the open window . The bird took its flight to a
dark wood  and remained there for a long time, and meanwhile the
parents could hear nothing of their child. Long after this, a man was making his way through the wood
when he heard a raven calling, and he followed the sound of the
voice. As he drew near, the raven said, ‘I am by birth a king’ s

however , set me free.’  ‘What am I to do?’ he asked. She replied, ‘Go
farther into the wood until you come to a house, wherein lives an old
woman; she will offer you food and drink, but you must not take of
either; if you do, you will fall into a deep sleep, and will not be able
to help me. In the garden behind the house is a large tan-heap, and on
that you must stand and watch for me. I shall drive there in my
carriage at two o’clock in the afternoon for three successive days; the
first day it will be drawn by four white,  the second by four chestnut,
and the last by four black horses; but if you fail to keep awake and I
find you sleeping, I shall not be set free.’
The man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said,
‘Alas! I know even now that you will take something from the
woman and be unable to save me.’ The man assured her again that he
would on no account touch a thing to eat or drink. When he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met
him, and said, ‘Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and
let me give you something to eat and drink.’
‘No,’  answered the man, ‘I will neither eat not drink.’
But she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, ‘If you
will not eat anything, at least you migh t take a draught of wine; one
drink counts for nothing,’  and at last he allowed himself to be
persuaded, and drank. As it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the
garden and mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a
feeling of fatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down
for a little while, fully determined, however , to keep awake; but in
another minute his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into
such a deep sleep, that all the noises in the world would not have
awakened him. At two o’clock the raven came driving along, drawn
by her four white horses; but even before she reached the spot, she
said to herself, sighing, ‘I know he has fallen asleep.’  When she
entered the garden, there she found him as she had feared, lying on6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

she called him and shook him, but it was all in vain, he still
continued sleeping. The next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food
and drink  which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her
persistent entreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass
and drank again. Towards two o’cloc k he went into the garden and on to the tan-
heap to watch for the raven. He had not been there long before he
began to feel so tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support
him, and he could not stand upright any longer; so again he lay down
and fell fast asleep . As the raven drove along her four chestnut
horses, she said sorrowfully to herself, ‘I know he has fallen asleep.’
She went as before to look for him, but he slept, and it was
impossible to awaken him. The following day the old woman said to him, ‘What is this? You
are not eating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?’
He answered, ‘I may not and will not either eat or drink.’
But she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of
him, and when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the
temptation, and took a deep draught. When the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-
heap in the garden to await the king’ s daughter , but he felt even more
overcome with weariness than on the two previous days, and
throwing himself down, he slept like a log. At two o’clock the raven
could be seen approaching, and this time her coachman and
everything about her , as well as her horses, were black. She was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully ,
‘I know he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.’  She
found him sleeping heavily , and all her efforts to awaken him were
of no avail.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Then she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a
flask of wine, of such a kind, that however much he took of them,
they would never grow less. After that she drew a gold ring, on
which her name was engraved, off her finger , and put it upon one of
his. Finall y, she laid a letter near him, in which, after giving him
particulars of the food and drink she had left for him, she finished
with the following words: ‘I see that as long as you remain here you
will never be able to set me free; if, however, you still wish to do so,
come to the golden castle of Strombe rg; this is well within your
power to accomplish .’ She then returned  to her carriage and drove to
the golden castle of Stromber g. When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was
grieved at heart, and said, ‘She has no doubt been here and driven
away again, and it is now too late for me to save her.’ Then his eyes
fell on the things which were lying besid e him; he read the letter , and
knew from  it all that had happened. He rose up without delay , eager
to start on his way and to reach the castle of Stromber g, but he had
no idea in which direction he ought to go. He travelled about a long
time in search of it and came at last to a dark forest, through which
he went on walking for fourteen days and still could not find a way
out. Once more the night came on, and worn out he lay down under a
bush and fell asleep. Again the next day he pursued his way through6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 145/201the forest, and that evening, thinking to rest again, he lay down as
before, but he heard such a howling and wailing that he found it
impossible to sleep. He waited till it was darker and people had
begun to light up their houses, and then seeing a little glimmer ahead
of him, he went towards it. He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller
than it really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an
immense giant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, ‘If the
giant sees me going in, my life will not be worth much.’  However ,
after a while he summoned up courage and went forward. When the
giant saw him, he called out, ‘It is lucky for that you have come, for I
have not had anything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for
my supper .’ ‘I would rather you let that alone,’  said the man, ‘for I do
not willingly give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I
have enough to satisfy your hunger .’ ‘If that is so,’ replied the giant,
‘I will leave you in peace; I only though t of eating you because I had
nothing else.’
So they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought
out the bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and
drunk of them, were still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with
the good cheer , and ate and drank to his heart’ s content. When he had
finished his supper the man asked him if he could direct him to the
castle of Stromber g. The giant said, ‘I will look on my map; on it are
marked all the towns, villages, and houses.’  So he fetched his map,
and looked for the castle, but could not find it. ‘Never mind,’  he said,
‘I have larger maps upstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,’
but they searched in vain, for the castle was not marked even on
these. The man now thought he should like to continue his journey ,
but the giant begged  him to remain for a day or two longer until the
return of his brother , who was away in search of provisions. When
the brother came home, they asked  him about the castle of
Stromber g, and he told them he would look on his own maps as soon
as he had eaten and appeased his hunge r. Accordingly , when he had
finished his supper , they all went up together to his room and looked
through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he fetched
other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until at last
they found it, but it was many thousand  miles away . ‘How shall I be
able to get there?’  asked the man. ‘I have two hours to spare,’  said
the giant, ‘and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I
must then return to look after the child who is in our care.’
The giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred
leagues of the castle, where he left him, saying, ‘You will be able to
walk the remainder of the way yourself.’  The man journeyed on day
and night till he reached the golden castle of Stromber g. He found it
situated, however , on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot
he saw the enchant ed maiden drive round her castle and then go
inside. He was overjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of
the moun tain, but the sides were so slippery that every time he
attempted to climb he fell back again . When he saw that it was
impossible to reach her, he was greatly grieved, and said to himself,
‘I will remain here and wait for her,’ so he built himself a little hut,
and there he sat and watched for a whole year, and every day he saw6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

get nearer to her . Looking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting
and he called out to them, ‘God be with you.’  They stopped when
they heard the call, but looking round and seeing nobody , they went
on again with their fighting, which now became more furious.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"‘God
be with you,’  he cried again, and again they paused and looked
about, but seeing no one went back to their fighting. A third time he
called out, ‘God be with you,’  and then thinking he should like to
know the cause of dispute between the three men, he went out and
asked them  why they were fighting so angrily with one another . One
of them said that he had found a stick, and that he had but to strike it
against any door through which he wished to pass, and it
immediately flew open. Another told him that he had found a cloak
which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had caught a horse
which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even up the glass
mountain. They had been unable to decide whether they would keep
together and have the things in common, or whether they would
separate. On hearing  this, the man said, ‘I will give you something in
exchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got,
but something that is of far more value. I must first, however , prove
whether all you have told me about your three things is true.’  The
robbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the
stick and the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no
longer visible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them
one after another , crying, ‘There, you idle vagabonds, you have got
what you deserve; are you satisfied now!’
After this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the
gate of the castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his
stick, and it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He
mounted the steps and entered the room where the maiden was
sitting, with a golden goblet full of wine in front of her. She could
not see him for he still wore his cloak. He took the ring which she
had given him off his finger , and threw  it into the goblet, so that it
rang as it touched the bottom. ‘That is my own ring,’  she exclaimed,
‘and if that is so the man must also be here who is coming to set me
free.’
She sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere. Meanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and
thrown off the cloak.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"When therefore she came to the castle gate she
saw him, and cried aloud for joy. Then  he dismounted and took her
in his arms; and she kissed him, and said, ‘Now you have indeed set
me free, and tomorrow we will celebrate our marriage.’6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was
called Dummling,[* ] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on
every occasion. [*] Simpleton
It happene d that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew
wood, and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet
cake and a bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from
hunger or thirst. When he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man
who bade him good day, and said: ‘Do give me a piece of cake out of
your pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry
and thirsty .’ But the clever son answered: ‘If I give you my cake and
wine, I shall have none for myself; be off with you,’  and he left the
little man standing and went on. But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he
made a false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to
go home and have it bound up. And this was the little grey man’ s
doing. After this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave
him, like the eldest,  a cake and a bottle  of wine. The little old grey
man met him likewi se, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink
of wine. But the second son, too, said sensibly enough: ‘What I give
you will be taken away from myself; be off!’ and he left the little
man standing and went on. His punishment, however , was not
delayed; when he had made a few blows at the tree he struck himself
in the leg, so that he had to be carried home. Then Dummling said: ‘Father , do let me go and cut wood.’  The
father answ ered: ‘Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it
alone, you do not understand anythin g about it.’ But Dummling
begged so long that at last he said: ‘Just go then, you will get wiser
by hurting  yourself. ’ His mother gave him a cake made with water
and baked in the cinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer . When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him
likewise, and greetin g him, said: ‘Give me a piece of your cake and a
drink out of your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty .’ Dummling
answered: ‘I have only cinder -cake and sour beer; if that pleases you,
we will sit down and eat.’ So they sat down, and when Dummling
pulled out his cinder -cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer
had becom e good wine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little
man said:  ‘Since you have a good heart, and are willing to divide
what you have, I will give you good luck. There stands an old tree,
cut it down, and you will find somethin g at the roots.’  Then the little
man took leave of him.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 148/201Dummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was
a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her
up, and taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he
would stay the night. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the
goose and were curious to know what such a wonderful bird might
be, and would have liked to have one of its golden feathers. The eldest thought: ‘I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out
a feather ,’ and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the
goose by the wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to
it. The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might
get a feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than
she was held fast. At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others
screamed out: ‘Keep away; for goodnes s’ sake keep away!’  But she
did not understand why she was to keep away . ‘The others are there,’
she thought, ‘I may as well be there too,’ and ran to them; but as
soon as she had touched her sister , she remained sticking fast to her. So they had to spend the night with the goose. The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set
out, without troubling himself about the three girls who were
hanging on to it. They were obliged to run after him continually , now
left, now right, wherever his legs took him. In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw
the proces sion he said: ‘For shame, you good-for -nothing girls, why
are you running across the fields after this young man? Is that
seemly?’  At the same time he seized the youngest by the hand in
order to pull her away, but as soon as he touched her he likewise
stuck fast, and was himself obliged to run behind. Before long the sexton came by and saw his master , the parson,
running behind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out:
‘Hi!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"your reverence, whither away so quickly?","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Do not forget that we
have a christening today!’  and running after him he took him by the
sleeve, but was also held fast to it. Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other , two
labourers came with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out
to them and begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But
they had scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and
now there were seven of them running behind Dummling and the
goose. Soon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a
daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So
he had put forth a decree that whosoever should be able to make her
laugh shou ld marry her. When Dumml ing heard this, he went with
his goose and all her train before the king’ s daughter , and as soon as
she saw the seven people running on and on, one behind the other ,
she began to laugh quite loudly , and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummli ng asked to have her for his wife; but the king
did not like the son-in-law , and made all manner of excuses and said
he must first produce a man who could drink a cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could certainly help
him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place where he had6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 149/201felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so sorely , and he
answered: ‘I have such a great thirst and cannot quench it; cold water
I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but that to me is
like a drop on a hot stone!’
‘There, I can help you,’  said Dummling, ‘just come with me and
you shall be satisfied.’
He led him into the king’ s cellar , and the man bent over the huge
barrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day
was out he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once
more for his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow ,
whom everyone called Dummling, should take away his daughter ,
and he made a new condition; he must first find a man who could eat
a whole mountain of bread. Dummling did not think long, but went
straight into the forest, where in the same place there sat a man who
was tying up his body with a strap, and making an awful face, and
saying: ‘I have eaten a whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that
when one has such a hunger as I? My stomach remains empty , and I
must tie myself up if I am not to die of hunger .’
At this Dummling was glad, and said: ‘Get up and come with me;
you shall eat yourself full.’  He led him to the king’ s palace where all
the flour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused
a huge mountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood
before it, began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain
had vanished. Then Dummling for the third time asked for his bride;
but the king again sought a way out, and ordered a ship which could
sail on land and on water . ‘As soon as you come sailing back in it,’
said he, ‘you shall have my daughter for wife.’
Dummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey
man to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling
wanted, he said: ‘Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will
give you the ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to
me.’ Then  he gave him the ship which could sail on land and water ,
and when the king saw that, he could no longer prevent him from
having his daughter . The wedding was celebrated, and after the
king’ s death, Dummling inherited his kingdom and lived for a long
time contentedly with his wife.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

Long before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great
way off, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill—so
ill that nobody thought he could live.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"His sons were very much
grieved at their father’s sickness; and as they were walking together
very mour nfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met
them and asked what was the matter . They told him that their father
was very ill, and that they were afraid  nothing could save him. ‘I
know what would,’  said the little old man; ‘it is the Water of Life. If
he could have a draught of it he would be well again; but it is very
hard to get.’ Then the eldest son said, ‘I will soon find it’: and he
went to the sick king, and begged that he might go in search of the
Water of Life, as it was the only thing that could save him. ‘No,’  said
the king. ‘I had rather die than place you in such great danger as you
must meet  with in your journey .’ But he begged so hard that the king
let him go; and the prince thought to himself, ‘If I bring my father
this water , he will make me sole heir to his kingdom.’
Then he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he
came to a deep valley , overhung with rocks and woods; and as he
looked around, he saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little
ugly dwar f, with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf
called to him and said, ‘Prince, whither so fast?’  ‘What is that to
thee, you ugly imp?’  said the prince haughtily , and rode on. But the dwarf was enraged at his behav iour, and laid a fairy spell
of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became
narrower and narrower , and at last the way was so straitened that he
could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his
horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh
ringing round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so
that he was shut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and
make his way on foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he
found himself unabl e to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide
spellbound. Meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son’s
return, till at last the second son said, ‘Father , I will go in search of
the Water of Life.’  For he thought to himself, ‘My brother is surely
dead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water .’ The king
was at first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his
wish. So he set out and followed the same road which his brother had
done, and met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot
in the mountains, saying, as before, ‘Prince, prince, whither so fast?’
‘Mind your own affairs, busybody!’  said the prince scornfully , and
rode on. But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder
brother , and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the
heart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 151/201themselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take
advice. When the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the
youngest son said he would go and search for the Water of Life, and
trusted he should soon be able to make  his father well again. So he
set out, and the dwarf met him too at the same spot in the valley ,
among the mountains, and said, ‘Princ e, whither so fast?’  And the
prince said, ‘I am going in search of the Water of Life, because my
father is ill, and like to die: can you help me? Pray be kind, and aid
me if you can!’  ‘Do you know where it is to be found?’  asked the
dwarf. ‘No,’ said the prince, ‘I do not.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Pray tell me if you know .’
‘Then as you have spoken to me kindly , and are wise enough to seek
for advice, I will tell you how and where to go. The water you seek
springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and, that you may be able
to reach it in safety , I will give you an iron wand and two little loaves
of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three times with the wand,
and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying down inside gaping
for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they will let you pass;
then hasten on to the well, and take some of the Water of Life before
the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer the door will shut
upon you for ever .’
Then the prince thanked his little friend  with the scarlet cloak for
his friendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling
on and on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey’ s end,
and found everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew
open at the third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted
he went on through the castle and came  at length to a beautiful hall. Around it he saw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled
off their rings and put them on his own fingers. In another room he
saw on a table a sword and a loaf of bread, which he also took. Further on he came to a room where a beautiful young lady sat upon
a couch; and she welcomed him joyfully , and said, if he would set
her free from the spell that bound her, the kingdom should be his, if
he would come back in a year and marr y her. Then she told him that
the well that held the Water of Life was in the palace gardens; and
bade him make haste, and draw what he wanted before the clock
struck twelve. He walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he
came to a delightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he
thought to himself, as he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a
while, and gaze on the lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself
down, and sleep fell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up
till the clock was striking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from
the couch dreadfully frightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was
standing by him full of water , and haste ned to get away in time. Just
as he was going out of the iron door it struck twelve, and the door
fell so quickly upon him that it snapped of f a piece of his heel. When he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had
got the Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards,
he passed by the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the
loaf, said, ‘You have made a noble prize ; with the sword you can at a
blow slay whole armies, and the bread will never fail you.’  Then the
prince thought to himself, ‘I cannot go home to my father without6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 152/201my brothers’; so he said, ‘My dear friend, cannot you tell me where
my two brothers are, who set out in search of the Water of Life
before me, and never came back?’  ‘I have shut them up by a charm
between two mount ains,’  said the dwar f, ‘because they were proud
and ill-beh aved, and scorned to ask advice.’  The prince begged so
hard for his brothers, that the dwarf at last set them free, though
unwillingly , saying, ‘Beware of them, for they have bad hearts.’
Their brother , however , was greatly rejoiced to see them, and told
them all that had happened to him; how he had found the Water of
Life, and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful
princess free from a spell that bound her; and how she had engaged
to wait a whole year, and then to marry him, and to give him the
kingdom. Then they all three rode on together , and on their way home came
to a country that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that
it was feared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of
the land the bread, and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king
the wonderful sword, and he slew the enemy’ s army with it; and thus
the kingdom was once more in peace and plenty . In the same manner
he befriended two other countries through which they passed on their
way. When they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their
voyage the two eldest said to themselves, ‘Our brother has got the
water which we could not find, therefo re our father will forsake us
and give him the kingdom, which is our right’; so they were full of
envy and revenge, and agreed together how they could ruin him. Then they waited till he was fast asleep, and poured the Water of Life
out of the cup, and took it for themselves, giving him bitter sea-water
instead. When they came to their journey’ s end, the youngest son brought
his cup to the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely ,
however , had he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse
even than he was before; and then both the elder sons came in, and
blamed the younges t for what they had done; and said that he wanted
to poison their father , but that they had found the Water of Life, and
had brought it with them. He no sooner  began to drink of what they
brought him, than he felt his sickness leave him, and was as strong
and well as in his younger days. Then they went to their brother , and
laughed at him, and said, ‘Well, brother , you found the Water of Life,
did you? You have had the trouble and we shall have the reward.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Pray, with all your cleverness, why did not you manage to keep your
eyes open? Next year one of us will take away your beautiful
princess, if you do not take care. You had better say nothing about
this to our father , for he does not believe a word you say; and if you

The old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and
thought that he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called
his court together , and asked what shoul d be done, and all agreed that
he ought to be put to death. The prince  knew nothing of what was
going on, till one day, when the king’s chief huntsmen went a-
hunting with him, and they were alone in the wood together , the
huntsman looked so sorrowful that the prince said, ‘My friend, what6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

the prince begged very hard, and said, ‘Only tell me what it is, and
do not think I shall be angry , for I will forgive you.’  ‘Alas!’  said the
huntsman; ‘the king has ordered me to shoot you.’  The prince started
at this, and said, ‘Let me live, and I will change dresses with you;
you shall take my royal coat to show to my father , and do you give
me your shabby one.’  ‘With all my heart,’  said the huntsman; ‘I am
sure I shall be glad to save you, for I could not have shot you.’  Then
he took the prince’ s coat, and gave him the shabby one, and went
away through the wood. Some time after, three grand embassies came to the old king’ s
court, with rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest
son; now all these were sent from the three kings to whom he had
lent his sword and loaf of bread, in order to rid them of their enemy
and feed their people. This touched the old king’ s heart, and he
thought his son might still be guiltless, and said to his court, ‘O that
my son were still alive! how it grieves me that I had him killed!’  ‘He
is still alive,’  said the huntsman; ‘and I am glad that I had pity on
him, but let him go in peace, and brought home his royal coat.’  At
this the king was overwhelmed with joy, and made it known
throughout all his kingdom, that if his son would come back to his
court he would for give him. Meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer
should come back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all
of shining gold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on
horseback, and rode straight up to the gate upon it, was her true
lover; and that they must let him in: but whoever rode on one side of
it, they must be sure was not the right one; and that they must send
him away at once. The time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he
would make haste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one
who had set her free, and that he should have her for his wife, and
the kingdom with her. As he came before the palace and saw the
golden road, he stopped to look at it, and he thought to himself, ‘It is
a pity to ride upon this beautiful road’; so he turned aside and rode
on the right-hand side of it. But when he came to the gate, the
guards, who had seen the road he took, said to him, he could not be
what he said he was, and must go about his business. The secon d prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and
when he came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot
upon it, he stopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and
said to himself, ‘What a pity it is that anything should tread here!’
Then he too turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he
came to the gate the guards said he was not the true prince, and that
he too must go away about his business; and away he went. Now when  the full year was come round, the third brother left the
forest in which he had lain hid for fear of his father ’s anger , and set
out in search of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on, thinking of
her all the way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the
road was made of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he
came to the gate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with
joy, and said he was her deliverer , and should now be her husband
and lord of the kingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

forgiven him, and of his wish to have him home again: so, before his
wedding with the princess, he went to visit his father , taking her with
him. Then  he told him everything; how his brothers had cheated and
robbed him, and yet that he had borne all those wrongs for the love
of his father . And the old king was very angry , and wanted to punish
his wicked sons; but they made their escape, and got into a ship and
sailed away over the wide sea, and where they went to nobody knew
and nobody cared. And now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all
his kingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the
princess. And young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple,
came at once on the summons; and among the rest came the friendly
dwarf, with the sugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak. And the wedding was held, and the merry bells run. And all the good people they danced and they sung,

There was once a king’ s son who had a bride whom he loved very
much. And when he was sitting beside her and very happy , news
came that his father lay sick unto death,  and desired to see him once
again before his end.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Then he said to his beloved: ‘I must now go
and leave you, I give you a ring as a remembrance of me. When I am
king, I will return and fetch you.’  So he rode away , and when he
reached his father , the latter was dangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: ‘Dear son, I wished to see you once again before my
end, promise me to marry as I wish,’  and he named a certain king’ s
daughter who was to be his wife. The son was in such trouble that he
did not think what he was doing, and said: ‘Yes, dear father , your
will shall be done,’  and thereupon the king shut his eyes, and died. When therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of
mourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had
given his father , and caused the king’ s daughter to be asked in
marriage, and she was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of
this, and fretted so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father said to her: ‘Dearest child, why are you so sad? You
shall have whatsoever you will.’  She thought for a moment and said:
‘Dear father, I wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face,
figure, and size.’  The father said: ‘If it be possible, your desire shall
be fulfilled,’  and he caused a search  to be made in his whole
kingdom, until eleven young maidens were found who exactly
resembled his daughter in face, figure, and size. When they came to the king’ s daughter , she had twelve suits of
huntsmen’ s clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to
put on the huntsmen ’s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit. Thereupon she took her leave of her father , and rode away with
them, and rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved
so dearly . Then she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he
would take all of them into his service. The king looked at her and
did not know her, but as they were such handsome fellows, he said:
‘Yes,’ and that he would willingly take them, and now they were the
king’ s twelve huntsmen. The king, however , had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for
he knew all concealed and secret thing s. It came to pass that one
evening he said to the king: ‘You think you have twelve huntsmen?’
‘Yes,’ said the king,  ‘they are twelve huntsmen.’  The lion continued:
‘You are mistaken, they are twelve girls.’  The king said: ‘That cannot
be true! How will you prove that to me?’  ‘Oh, just let some peas be
strewn in the ante-c hamber ,’ answered the lion, ‘and then you will
soon see. Men have  a firm step, and when they walk over peas none
of them stir, but girls trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas
roll about. ’ The king was well pleased with the counsel, and caused
the peas to be strewn.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 156/201There was, however , a servant of the king’ s who favoured the
huntsmen, and when he heard that they were going to be put to this
test he went to them and repeated everything, and said: ‘The lion
wants to make the king believe that you are girls.’  Then the king’ s
daughter thanked him, and said to her maidens: ‘Show some
strength, and step firmly on the peas.’  So next morning when the
king had the twelve huntsmen called before him, and they came into
the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they stepped so firmly
on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not one of the peas
either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again, and the king said
to the lion: ‘You have lied to me, they walk just like men.’  The lion
said: ‘They have been informed that they were going to be put to the
test, and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve spinning-
wheels be brought into the ante-chamber , and they will go to them
and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.’ The
king liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the
ante-chamber . But the servant, who was well disposed  to the huntsmen, went to
them, and disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king’ s
daughter said to her eleven girls: ‘Show  some constraint, and do not
look round at the spinning-wheels.’  And next morning when the king
had his twelve huntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-
chamber , and never once looked at the spinning-wheels. Then the
king again  said to the lion: ‘You have deceived me, they are men, for
they have not looked  at the spinning-wh eels.’  The lion replied: ‘They
have restrained themselves.’  The king, however , would no longer
believe the lion. The twelv e huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and
his liking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that
once when  they were out hunting, news came that the king’ s bride
was approaching. When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much
that her heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The king thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran
up to him, wanted to help him, and drew his glove off. Then he saw
the ring which he had given to his first bride, and when he looked in
her face he recognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he
kissed her, and when she opened her eyes he said: ‘You are mine,
and I am yours, and no one in the world can alter that.’  He sent a
messenger to the other bride, and entreated her to return to her own
kingdom, for he had a wife already , and someone who had just found
an old key did not require a new one. Thereupon the wedding was
celebrated, and the lion was again taken into favour , because, after
all, he had told the truth.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

There was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that
was very young, and barely able to run alone. He had two richly
laden ships then making a voyage upon the seas, in which he had
embarked all his wealth, in the hope of making great gains, when the
news came that both were lost.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Thus from being a rich man he
became all at once so very poor that nothing was left to him but one
small plot of land; and there he often went in an evening to take his
walk, and ease his mind of a little of his trouble. One day, as he was roaming along in a brown study , thinking with
no great comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was
like to be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-
looking, black dwarf. ‘Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?’  said he to
the merch ant; ‘what is it you take so deeply to heart?’  ‘If you would
do me any good I would willingly tell you,’  said the merchant. ‘Who
knows but I may?’  said the little man:  ‘tell me what ails you, and
perhaps you will find I may be of some use.’ Then the merchant told
him how all his wealth was gone to the bottom of the sea, and how
he had nothing left but that little plot of land. ‘Oh, trouble not
yourself about that,’  said the dwarf; ‘only undertake to bring me
here, twelve years hence, whatever meets you first on your going
home, and I will give you as much as you please.’  The merchant
thought this was no great thing to ask; that it would most likely be
his dog or his cat, or something of that sort, but forgot his little boy
Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and signed and sealed the bond
to do what was asked of him. But as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him
that he crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up
in his face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear
and horror , and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but
as no gold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was
only a joke that the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate,
when the money came, he should see the bearer , and would not take
it in. About a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber -room to
look for some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money;
and there, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the
floor . At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about
his son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than
before. Meantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years
drew near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became
very sad and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon
his face. The boy one day asked what was the matter , but his father
would not tell for some time; at last, however , he said that he had,
without knowing it, sold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black
dwarf, and that the twelve years were coming round when he must6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 158/201keep his word. Then Heinel said, ‘Father , give yourself very little
trouble about that; I shall be too much for the little man.’
When the time came, the father and son went out together to the
place agreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set
himself and his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon
came, and walked round and round about the circle, but could not
find any way to get into it, and he either could not, or dared not,
jump over it. At last the boy said to him. ‘Have you anything to say
to us, my friend, or what do you want?’  Now Heinel had found a
friend in a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to
do; for this fairy knew what good luck was in store for him. ‘Have
you broug ht me what you said you would?’  said the dwarf to the
merchant. The old man held his tongue, but Heinel said again, ‘What
do you want here?’  The dwarf said, ‘I come to talk with your father ,
not with you.’  ‘You have cheated and taken in my father ,’ said the
son; ‘pray  give him up his bond at once.’  ‘Fair and softly ,’ said the
little old man; ‘right is right; I have paid my money , and your father
has had it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me have what I paid it
for.’ ‘You must have  my consent to that first,’  said Heinel, ‘so please
to step in here, and let us talk it over.’ The old man grinned, and
showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad to get into the
circle if he could. Then at last, after a long talk, they came to terms. Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and that so far the
dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the fairy had told
Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed his own
course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed
friend, who seemed so anxious for his company . So, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter , it was settled that
Heinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard
by; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that
he should thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind
and weather . Then he took leave of his father , and set himself in the
boat, but before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one
side low in the water , so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was
lost, and went home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way,
thinking that at any rate he had had his revenge. The boat, however , did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her
friend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The
young man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an
unknown land. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a
beautiful castle but empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. ‘Here,’  said he to himself, ‘must I find the prize the good fairy told
me of.’ So he once more searched the whole palace through, till at
last he found a white snake, lying coile d up on a cushion in one of
the chambers. Now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very
glad to see him, and said, ‘Are you at last come to set me free? Twelve long years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither
as she promised, for you alone can save me. This night twelve men
will come: their faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain
armour . They will ask what you do here, but give no answer; and let
them do what they will—beat, whip, pinch, prick, or torment you—
bear all; only speak  not a word, and at twelve o’clock they must go6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

twenty-four , who will even cut off your head; but at the twelfth hour
of that night their power is gone, and I shall be free, and will come
and bring you the Water of Life, and will wash you with it, and bring
you back to life and health.’  And all came to pass as she had said;
Heinel bore all, and spoke not a word; and the third night the
princess came, and fell on his neck and kissed him. Joy and gladness
burst forth  throughout the castle, the wedding was celebrated, and he
was crowned king of the Golden Mountain.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"They lived together very happily , and the queen had a son.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"And
thus eight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought
of his father; and he began to long to see him once again. But the
queen was against his going, and said, ‘I know well that misfortunes
will come  upon us if you go.’ However , he gave her no rest till she
agreed. At his going away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said,
‘Take this ring, and put it on your finger; whatever you wish it will
bring you; only promise never to make use of it to bring me hence to
your fathe r’s house. ’ Then he said he would do what she asked, and
put the ring on his finger , and wished himself near the town where
his father lived. Heinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards
would not let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he
went up to a neighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and
borrowed his old frock, and thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his father ’s house, he said he was his son; but the
merchant would not believe him, and said he had had but one son,
his poor Heinel, who he knew was long since dead: and as he was
only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would not even give him
anything to eat. The king, however , still vowed that he was his son,
and said, ‘Is there no mark by which you would know me if I am
really your son?’  ‘Yes,’ said his mother , ‘our Heinel had a mark like a
raspberry on his right arm.’  Then he showed them the mark, and they
knew that what he had said was true. He next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and
was married to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the
merchant said, ‘that can never be true; he must be a fine king truly
who trave ls about in a shepherd’ s frock !’ At this the son was vexed;
and forgetting his word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen
and son. In an instant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and
said he had broken his word, and bad luck would follow . He did all
he could to soothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she
was not so in truth,  and was only thinking how she should punish
him. One day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed
her the spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then
he sat himself down , and said, ‘I am very much tired; sit by me, I
will rest my head in your lap, and sleep a while.’  As soon as he had
fallen asleep, however , she drew the ring from his finger , and crept
softly away, and wished herself and her son at home in their
kingdom.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"And when he awoke he found himself alone, and saw that
the ring was gone from his finger . ‘I can never go back to my father ’s
house,’  said he; ‘they would say I am a sorcerer: I will journey forth

three giants were sharing their father ’s goods; and as they saw him
pass they cried out and said, ‘Little men have sharp wits; he shall
part the goods between us.’ Now there  was a sword that cut off an
enemy’ s head whenever the wearer gave the words, ‘Heads off!’; a
cloak that made the owner invisible, or gave him any form he
pleased; and a pair of boots that carried the wearer wherever he
wished. Heinel said they must first let him try these wonderful
things, then he might know how to set a value upon them. Then they
gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly, and in a moment he
was a fly. ‘The cloak  is very well,’  said he: ‘now give me the sword.’
‘No,’  said they; ‘not unless you undert ake not to say, “Heads off!”
for if you do we are all dead men.’  So they gave it him, charging him
to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also; and the moment
he had all three in his power , he wished himself at the Golden
Mountain; and there he was at once. So the giants were left behind
with no goods to share or quarrel about. As Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music;
and the people around told him that his queen was about to marry
another husband. Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed
through the castle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen,
where no one saw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her
plate, he took it away and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine
was handed to her, he took it and drank it; and thus, though they kept
on giving her meat and drink, her plate and cup were always empty . Upon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her
chamber alone, and sat there weeping;  and he followed her there. ‘Alas!’  said she to herself, ‘was I not once set free? Why then does
this enchantment still seem to bind me?’
‘False and fickle one!’  said he. ‘One indeed came who set thee
free, and he is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to have had such treatment from thee?’  Then he went out
and sent away the company , and said the wedding was at an end, for
that he was come back to the kingdom. But the princes, peers, and
great men mocked at him. However , he would enter into no parley
with them , but only asked them if they would go in peace or not.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who
drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a
doctor for two talers. When the money was being counted out to him,
it so happened that the doctor was sitting at table, and when the
peasant saw how well he ate and drank, his heart desired what he
saw, and would willingly have been a doctor too. So he remained
standing a while, and at length inquired if he too could not be a
doctor . ‘Oh, yes,’ said the doctor , ‘that is soon managed.’  ‘What must
I do?’ asked the peasant. ‘In the first place buy yourself an A B C
book of the kind which has a cock on the frontispiece; in the second,
turn your cart and your two oxen into money , and get yourself some
clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to medicine; thirdly , have a
sign painted for yourself with the words: “I am Doctor Knowall,”
and have that naile d up above your house-door .’ The peasant did
everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored people
awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such
a village, and must know what had beco me of the money . So the lord
had the horses harne ssed to his carriage,  drove out to the village, and
asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then
he was to go with him and bring back the stolen money . ‘Oh, yes, but
Grete, my wife, must go too.’ The lord was willing, and let both of
them have  a seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together . When they came to the nobleman’ s castle, the table was spread, and
Crabb was told to sit down and eat. ‘Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,’
said he, and he seated himself with her at the table. And when the
first servant came with a dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his
wife, and said: ‘Grete, that was the first,’ meaning that was the
servant who brought the first dish. The servant, however , thought he
intended by that to say: ‘That is the first thief,’  and as he actually was
so, he was terrified, and said to his comrade outside: ‘The doctor
knows all: we shall fare ill, he said I was the first.’  The second did
not want to go in at all, but was forced. So when he went in with his
dish, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ‘Grete, that is the
second.’  This servan t was equally alarm ed, and he got out as fast as
he could. The third fared no better , for the peasant again said: ‘Grete,
that is the third.’  The fourth had to carry in a dish that was covered,
and the lord told the doctor that he was to show his skill, and guess
what was beneath the cover . Actually , there were crabs. The doctor
looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and cried: ‘Ah, poor
Crabb.’  When the lord heard that, he cried: ‘There!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"he knows it; he
must also know who has the money!’
On this the servants looked terribly uneasy , and made a sign to the
doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When
therefore he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had
stolen the money , and said that they would willingly restore it and
give him a heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

where the money was concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied,
and return ed to the hall, sat down to the table, and said: ‘My lord,

servant, however , crept into the stove to hear if the doctor knew still
more. But the docto r sat still and opened his A B C book, turned the
pages back wards and forwards, and looked for the cock. As he could
not find it immediately he said: ‘I know you are there, so you had
better come out!’ Then the fellow in the stove thought that the doctor
meant him, and full of terror , sprang out, crying: ‘That man knows
everything!’  Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord where the money
was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received from both sides
much money in reward, and became a renowned man.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

There was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one
daughter . Although the little girl was very pretty , she was so weak
and small  that they thought she could  not live; but they said she
should at once be christened.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"So the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some
water , but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at
drawing the water , and so they were in such a hurry that all let their
pitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at
one another , and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the meantime the father was uneasy , and could not tell what made
the young men stay so long. ‘Surely ,’ said he, ‘the whole seven must
have forgotten themselves over some game of play’; and when he
had waited still longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage
and wished them all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these
words when he heard a croaking over his head, and looked up and
saw seven ravens as black as coal flying round and round. Sorry as
he was to see his wish so fulfilled, he did not know how what was
done could be undone, and comforted himself as well as he could for
the loss of his seven sons with his dear little daughter , who soon
became stronger and every day more beautiful. For a long time she did not know that she had ever had any
brothers; for her father and mother took care not to speak of them
before her: but one day by chance she heard the people about her
speak of them. ‘Yes,’ said they, ‘she is beautiful indeed, but still ‘tis a
pity that her brother s should have been  lost for her sake.’  Then she
was much grieved, and went to her father and mother , and asked if
she had any brothers, and what had become of them. So they dared
no longer hide the truth from her, but said it was the will of Heaven,
and that her birth was only the innocent  cause of it; but the little girl
mourned sadly about it every day , and thought herself bound to do all
she could to bring her brothers back; and she had neither rest nor
ease, till at length one day she stole away , and set out into the wide
world to find her brothers, wherever they might be, and free them,
whatever it might cost her . She took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and
mother had given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry , a
little pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty , and a little stool to
rest upon when she should be weary . Thus she went on and on, and
journeyed till she came to the world’ s end; then she came to the sun,
but the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly
to the moon, but the moon was cold and chilly , and said, ‘I smell
flesh and blood this way!’  so she took herself away in a hurry and
came to the stars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and
each star sat upon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up
and gave her a little piece of wood, and said, ‘If you have not this
little piece of wood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

piece of wood, rolled it up in a little cloth, and went on again until
she came to the glass-mountain, and found the door shut. Then she
felt for the little piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it
was not there, and she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done? She wanted to save her brothers, and had no
key of the castle of the glass-mountain; so this faithful little sister
took a knife out of her pocket and cut off her little finger , that was
just the size of the piece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door
and opened it. As she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, ‘What are
you seeking for?’ ‘I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,’
answered she. Then the dwarf said, ‘My masters are not at home; but
if you will wait till they come, pray step in.’ Now the little dwarf was
getting their dinner ready , and he brought their food upon seven little
plates, and their drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the
table, and out of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out
of each little glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that
she had brought with her fall into the last glass. On a sudd en she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the
dwarf said, ‘Here come my masters.’  When they came in, they
wanted to eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said one after the other ,
‘Who has eaten from  my little plate? And who has been drinking
out of my little glass?’

When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there
the ring, he looked  at it, and knew that it was his father ’s and
mother ’s, and said, ‘O that our little sister would but come! then we
should be free.’  When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind
the door all the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant
all the ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed
each other , and went merrily home.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

FIRST  STORY
There was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who
believed that his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her
to the test. He stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a
limb, and behaved as if he were stone dead.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Mrs Fox went up to her
room, shut herself in, and her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did
the cooking. When it became known that the old fox was dead,
suitors presented themselves. The maid heard someone standing at
the house-door , knocking. She went and opened it, and it was a
young fox, who said:
 ‘What may you be about, Miss Cat? Do you sleep or do you wake?’
She answered:
 ‘I am not sleeping, I am waking,
  Would you know what I am making? I am boiling warm beer with butter,
  Will you be my guest for supper?’
‘No, thank  you, miss,’  said the fox, ‘what is Mrs Fox doing?’  The
maid replied:
 ‘She is sitting in her room,
  Moaning in her gloom,
  Weeping her little eyes quite red,
  Because old Mr Fox is dead.’
‘Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to
woo her .’ ‘Certainly , young sir .’
  The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,
  The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,
 ‘Mistress Fox, are you inside?’
 ‘Oh, yes, my little cat,’ she cried. ‘A wooer he stands at the door out there.’
 ‘What does he look like, my dear?’
‘Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?’  ‘Oh, no,’
answered the cat, ‘he has only one.’  ‘Then I will not have him.’
Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away . Soon
afterwards there was another knock, and another fox was at the door
who wished to woo Mrs Fox. He had two tails, but he did not fare
better than the first. After this still more came, each with one tail
more than the other , but they were all turned away , until at last one
came who had nine tails, like old Mr Fox. When the widow heard
that, she said joyfully to the cat:
 ‘Now open the gates and doors all wide,
  And carry old Mr Fox outside.’

When old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor , and
knocked at the door, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened
it for him. The wolf greeted her , and said:
 ‘Good day, Mrs Cat of Kehrewit,
  How comes it that alone you sit? What are you making good?’
The cat replied:
 ‘In milk I’m breaking bread so sweet,
  Will you be my guest, and eat?’
‘No, thank  you, Mrs Cat,’  answered the wolf. ‘Is Mrs Fox not at
home?’
The cat said:
 ‘She sits upstairs in her room,
  Bewailing her sorrowful doom,
  Bewailing her trouble so sore,
  For old Mr Fox is no more.’
The wolf answered:
 ‘If she’s in want of a husband now,
  Then will it please her to step below?’
  The cat runs quickly up the stair,
  And lets her tail fly here and there,
  Until she comes to the parlour door. With her five gold rings at the door she knocks:
 ‘Are you within, good Mistress Fox? If you’re in want of a husband now,
  Then will it please you to step below? Mrs Fox asked: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a
pointed mouth?’  ‘No,’  answered the cat. ‘Then he won’ t do for me.’
When the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion,
and all the beasts of the forest, one after the other . But one of the
good quali ties which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking,
and the cat had continually to send the suitors away . At length came
a young fox. Then Mrs Fox said: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings
on, and has a little pointed mouth?’  ‘Yes,’ said the cat, ‘he has.’
‘Then let him come upstairs,’  said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant
to prepare the wedding feast. ‘Sweep me the room as clean as you can,
  Up with the window, fling out my old man! For many a fine fat mouse he brought,
  Yet of his wife he never thought,
  But ate up every one he caught.’
Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there
was much rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they
are dancing still.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

As a merry  young huntsman was once going briskly along through
a wood, there came up a little old wom an, and said to him, ‘Good
day, good day; you seem merry enough, but I am hungry and thirsty;
do pray give me something to eat.’ The huntsman took pity on her,
and put his hand in his pocket and gave her what he had. Then he
wanted to go his way; but she took hold of him, and said, ‘Listen, my
friend, to what I am going to tell you; I will reward you for your
kindness; go your way, and after a little time you will come to a tree
where you will see nine birds sitting on a cloak.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Shoot into the midst
of them, and one will fall down dead: the cloak will fall too; take it,
it is a wishing-cloak , and when you wear it you will find yourself at
any place where you may wish to be. Cut open the dead bird, take
out its heart and keep it, and you will find a piece of gold under your
pillow every morning when you rise. It is the bird’ s heart that will
bring you this good luck.’
The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, ‘If all this does
happen, it will be a fine thing for me.’ When he had gone a hundred
steps or so, he heard  a screaming and chirping in the branches over
him, and looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with
their bills and feet; screaming, fighting,  and tugging at each other as
if each wished to have it himself. ‘Well,’ said the huntsman, ‘this is
wonderful; this happens just as the old woman said’; then he shot
into the midst of them so that their feathers flew all about. Off went
the flock chattering away; but one fell down dead, and the cloak with
it. Then the huntsman did as the old woman told him, cut open the
bird, took out the heart, and carried the cloak home with him. The next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow , and there
lay the piece of gold glittering underneath; the same happened next
day, and indeed every day when he arose. He heaped up a great deal
of gold, and at last thought to himself, ‘Of what use is this gold to
me whilst I am at home? I will go out into the world and look about
me.’
Then he took leave of his friends, and hung his bag and bow about
his neck, and went his way. It so happened that his road one day led
through a thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a
green meadow , and at one of the windows stood an old woman with
a very beautiful young lady by her side looking about them. Now the
old woman was a witch, and said to the young lady, ‘There is a
young man coming out of the wood who carries a wonderful prize;
we must get it away from him, my dear child, for it is more fit for us
than for him. He has a bird’ s heart that brings a piece of gold under
his pillow  every morning.’  Meantime the huntsman came nearer and
looked at the lady, and said to himself, ‘I have been travelling so
long that I should like to go into this castle and rest myself, for I
have money enough to pay for anything I want’; but the real reason
was, that he wanted to see more of the beautiful lady. Then he went6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 168/201into the house, and was welcomed kindly; and it was not long before
he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else but looking at
the lady’s eyes, and doing everything that she wished. Then the old
woman said, ‘Now is the time for getting the bird’ s heart.’  So the
lady stole it away , and he never found any more gold under his
pillow , for it lay now under the young  lady’ s, and the old woman
took it away every morning; but he was so much in love that he
never missed his prize. ‘Well,’ said the old witch, ‘we have got the bird’ s heart, but not the
wishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.’ ‘Let us leave him
that,’  said the young lady; ‘he has already lost his wealth.’  Then the
witch was very angry , and said, ‘Such a cloak is a very rare and
wonderful thing, and I must and will have it.’ So she did as the old
woman told her, and set herself at the window , and looked about the
country and seemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, ‘What
makes you so sad?’  ‘Alas! dear sir,’ said she, ‘yonder lies the granite
rock where all the costly diamonds grow , and I want so much to go
there, that whenever I think of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for
who can reach it? only the birds and the flies—man cannot.’  ‘If that’s
all your grief,’  said the huntsman, ‘I’ll take you there with all my
heart’; so he drew her under his cloak, and the moment he wished to
be on the granite mountain they were both there. The diamonds
glittered so on all sides that they were delighted with the sight and
picked up the finest. But the old witch made a deep sleep come upon
him, and he said to the young lady, ‘Let us sit down and rest
ourselves a little, I am so tired that I cannot stand any longer .’ So
they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap and fell asleep; and
whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from his shoulders,
hung it on her own, picked up the diamonds, and wished herself
home again. When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left
him alone on the wild rock, he said, ‘Alas! what roguery there is in
the world! ’ and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what
to do. Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and
as he saw three of them striding about, he thought to himself, ‘I can
only save myself by feigning to be asleep’; so he laid himself down
as if he were in a sound sleep. When the giants came up to him, the
first pushe d him with his foot, and said, ‘What worm is this that lies
here curle d up?’ ‘Tread upon him and kill him,’  said the second. ‘It’s
not worth the troubl e,’ said the third; ‘let him live, he’ll go climbing
higher up the mount ain, and some cloud will come rolling and carry
him away .’ And they passed on. But the huntsman had heard all they
said; and as soon as they were gone, he climbed to the top of the
mountain, and when he had sat there a short time a cloud came
rolling around him, and caught him in a whirlwind and bore him
along for some time, till it settled in a garden, and he fell quite gently
to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages. Then he looked around him, and said, ‘I wish I had something to
eat, if not I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither
apples nor pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.’  At
last he thought to himself, ‘I can eat salad, it will refresh and
strengthen me.’ So he picked out a fine head and ate of it; but
scarcely had he swallowed two bites when he felt himself quite6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 169/201changed, and saw with horror that he was turned into an ass. However , he still felt very hungry , and the salad tasted very nice; so
he ate on till he came to another kind of salad, and scarcely had he
tasted it when he felt another change come over him, and soon saw
that he was lucky enough to have found his old shape again. Then he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness;
and when he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the
good and the bad salad, and thought to himself, ‘This will help me to
my fortun e again, and enable me to pay off some folks for their
treachery .’ So he went away to try and find the castle of his friends;
and after wandering about a few days he luckily found it. Then he
stained his face all over brown, so that even his mother would not
have known him, and went into the castle and asked for a lodging; ‘I
am so tired,’ said he, ‘that I can go no farther .’ ‘Countryman,’  said
the witch, ‘who are you? and what is your business?’  ‘I am,’ said he,
‘a messen ger sent by the king to find the finest salad that grows
under the sun. I have been lucky enough to find it, and have brought
it with me; but the heat of the sun scorches so that it begins to wither ,
and I don’ t know that I can carry it farther .’
When the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad,
they longe d to taste it, and said, ‘Dear countryman, let us just taste
it.’ ‘To be sure,’  answered he; ‘I have two heads of it with me, and
will give you one’; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then the witch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and
when it was ready she could not wait till it was carried up, but took a
few leaves immediately and put them in her mouth, and scarcely
were they swallowed when she lost her own form and ran braying
down into the court in the form of an ass. Now the servant-maid
came into the kitchen, and seeing the salad ready , was going to carry
it up; but on the way she too felt a wish to taste it as the old woman
had done, and ate some leaves; so she also was turned into an ass and
ran after the other , letting the dish with the salad fall on the ground. The messenger sat all this time with the beautiful young lady, and as
nobody came with the salad and she longed to taste it, she said, ‘I
don’t know where the salad can be.’ Then he thought something must
have happened, and said, ‘I will go into the kitchen and see.’ And as
he went he saw two asses in the court running about, and the salad
lying on the ground. ‘All right!’  said he; ‘those two have had their
share.’  Then he took up the rest of the leaves, laid them on the dish
and brought them to the young lady, saying, ‘I bring you the dish
myself that you may not wait any longer .’ So she ate of it, and like
the others ran of f into the court braying away . Then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that
they might know him. ‘Now you shall be paid for your roguery ,’ said
he; and tied them all three to a rope and took them along with him
till he came to a mill and knocked at the window .","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

other; ‘if you will take them, give them food and room, and treat

heart,’  said the miller; ‘but how shall I treat them?’  Then the
huntsman said, ‘Give the old one stripe s three times a day and hay

his heart to have her beaten. After this he went back to the castle,
where he found everything he wanted.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Some days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old
ass was dead; ‘The other two,’  said he, ‘are alive and eat, but are so
sorrowful that they cannot last long.’  Then the huntsman pitied them,
and told the miller to drive them back to him, and when they came,
he gave them some of the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young
lady fell upon her knees before him, and said, ‘O dearest huntsman!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

FOR TH TO LEARN WHA T FEAR WAS
A certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and
sensible, and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and
could neither learn nor understand anything, and when people saw
him they said: ‘There’ s a fellow who will give his father some
trouble!’  When anything had to be done, it was always the elder who
was forced to do it; but if his father bade him fetch anything when it
was late, or in the night-time, and the way led through the
churchyard, or any other dismal place, he answered: ‘Oh, no father ,
I’ll not go there, it makes me shudder!’  for he was afraid. Or when
stories were told by the fire at night which made the flesh creep, the
listeners sometimes said: ‘Oh, it makes us shudder!’  The younger sat
in a corner and listened with the rest of them, and could not imagine
what they could mean.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"‘They are always saying: “It makes me
shudder , it makes me shudder!” It does not make me shudder ,’
thought he. ‘That, too, must be an art of which I understand
nothing!’
Now it came to pass that his father said to him one day: ‘Hearken
to me, you fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and
strong, and you too must learn something by which you can earn
your bread . Look how your brother works, but you do not even earn
your salt.’  ‘Well, father,’ he replied, ‘I am quite willing to learn
something—indeed, if it could but be managed, I should like to learn
how to shudder . I don’t understand that at all yet.’ The elder brother
smiled when he heard that, and thought to himself: ‘Goodness, what
a blockhe ad that brother of mine is! He will never be good for
anything as long as he lives! He who wants to be a sickle must bend
himself betimes.’
The father  sighed, and answered him: ‘You shall soon learn what it
is to shudder , but you will not earn your bread by that.’
Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the
father bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so
backward in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. ‘Just think,’  said he, ‘when I asked him how he was going to earn his
bread, he actually wanted to learn to shudder .’ ‘If that be all,’ replied
the sexton , ‘he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will
soon polish him.’  The father was glad to do it, for he thought: ‘It will
train the boy a little.’ The sexton theref ore took him into his house,
and he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton
awoke him at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church
tower and ring the bell. ‘You shall soon learn what shuddering is,’
thought he, and secretly went there before him; and when the boy
was at the top of the tower and turned round, and was just going to
take hold of the bell rope, he saw a white figure standing on the
stairs opposite the sounding hole. ‘Who  is there?’  cried he, but the6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 172/201figure made no reply , and did not move or stir. ‘Give an answer ,’
cried the boy, ‘or take yourself off, you have no business here at
night.’
The sexton, however , remained standing motionless that the boy
might think he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: ‘What do
you want here?—speak if you are an honest fellow , or I will throw
you down  the steps!’  The sexton thoug ht: ‘He can’t mean to be as
bad as his words,’  uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of
stone. Then the boy called to him for the third time, and as that was
also to no purpose, he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the
stairs, so that it fell down the ten steps and remained lying there in a
corner . Thereupon he rang the bell, went home, and without saying a
word went to bed, and fell asleep. The sexton’ s wife waited a long
time for her husba nd, but he did not come back. At length she
became uneasy , and wakened the boy, and asked: ‘Do you know
where my husband is? He climbed up the tower before you did.’ ‘No,
I don’t know ,’ replied the boy, ‘but someone was standing by the
sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he would neither
give an answer nor go away , I took him for a scoundrel, and threw
him downstairs. Just go there and you will see if it was he. I should
be sorry if it were.’  The woman ran away and found her husband,
who was lying moaning in the corner , and had broken his leg. She carrie d him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to
the boy’s father , ‘Your boy,’ cried she, ‘has been the cause of a great
misfortune! He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he
broke his leg. Take the good-for -nothing fellow out of our house.’
The father was terrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. ‘What
wicked tricks are these?’  said he. ‘The devil must have put them into
your head. ’ ‘Father ,’ he replied, ‘do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was standing there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did
not know who it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak
or to go away .’ ‘Ah,’ said the father , ‘I have nothing but unhappiness
with you. Go out of my sight.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"I will see you no more.’
‘Yes, fathe r, right willingly , wait only until it is day. Then will I go
forth and learn how to shudder , and then I shall, at any rate,
understand one art which will support me.’ ‘Learn what you will,’
spoke the father , ‘it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for
you. Take these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from
whence you come, and who is your father , for I have reason to be
ashamed of you.’  ‘Yes, father , it shall be as you will. If you desire
nothing more than that, I can easily keep it in mind.’
When the day dawn ed, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into
his pocket, and went forth on the great highway , and continually said
to himself: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!’  Then a
man approached who heard this conversation which the youth was
holding with himself, and when they had walked a little farther to
where they could see the gallows, the man said to him: ‘Look, there
is the tree where seven men have marri ed the ropemaker ’s daughter ,
and are now learning how to fly. Sit down beneath it, and wait till
night comes, and you will soon learn how to shudder .’ ‘If that is all
that is wanted,’  answered the youth, ‘it is easily done; but if I learn
how to shudder as fast as that, you shall have my fifty talers. Just
come back to me early in the morning. ’ Then the youth went to the6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

he was cold, he lighted himself a fire, but at midnight the wind blew
so sharply that in spite of his fire, he could not get warm. And as the
wind knocked the hanged men against each other , and they moved
backwards and forwards, he thought to himself: ‘If you shiver below
by the fire, how those up above must freeze and suffer!’ And as he
felt pity for them, he raised the ladder , and climbed up, unbound one
of them after the other , and brought down all seven. Then he stoked
the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm themselves. But
they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught their clothes. So he
said: ‘Take care, or I will hang you up again.’  The dead men,
however , did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their rags go on
burning. At this he grew angry , and said: ‘If you will not take care, I
cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,’  and he hung them up
again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell asleep,
and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have the
fifty talers, and said: ‘Well do you know how to shudder?’  ‘No,’
answered he, ‘how should I know? Those fellows up there did not
open their mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags
which they had on their bodies get burnt.’ Then the man saw that he
would not get the fifty talers that day, and went away saying: ‘Such a
youth has never come my way before.’
The youth  likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter
to himself: ‘Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!’  A
waggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: ‘Who
are you?’  ‘I don’t know ,’ answered the youth. Then the waggoner
asked: ‘From whence do you come?’  ‘I know not.’ ‘Who is your
father?’  ‘That I may not tell you.’  ‘What is it that you are always
muttering between your teeth?’  ‘Ah,’  replied the youth, ‘I do so wish
I could shudder , but no one can teach me how.’ ‘Enough of your
foolish chatter ,’ said the waggoner . ‘Come, go with me, I will see
about a place for you.’  The youth went with the waggoner , and in the
evening they arrived at an inn where they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlour the youth again said quite loudly:
‘If I could  but shudder! If I could but shudder!’  The host who heard
this, laughed and said: ‘If that is your desire, there ought to be a good
opportunity for you here.’  ‘Ah, be silen t,’ said the hostess, ‘so many
prying persons have already lost their lives, it would be a pity and a
shame if such beaut iful eyes as these should never see the daylight
again.’
But the youth said: ‘However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.’  He let the host have
no rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a
haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering
was, if he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had
promised that he who would venture should have his daughter to
wife, and she was the most beautiful  maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great treasures, which were guarded by
evil spirits, and these treasures would then be freed, and would make
a poor man rich enough. Already many men had gone into the castle,
but as yet none had come out again. Then the youth went next
morning to the king, and said: ‘If it be allowed, I will willingly
watch three nights in the haunted castle.’6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 174/201The king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said:
‘You may ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but
they must be things without life.’ Then he answered: ‘Then I ask for
a fire, a turning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.’
The king had these things carried into the castle for him during the
day. When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made
himself a bright fire in one of the room s, placed the cutting-board
and knife beside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe. ‘Ah, if I
could but shudder!’  said he, ‘but I shall not learn it here either .’
Towards midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was
blowing it, something cried suddenly from one corner: ‘Au, miau! how cold we are!’ ‘You fools!’  cried he, ‘what are you crying about? If you are cold, come and take a seat by the fire and warm
yourselves.’  And when he had said that, two great black cats came
with one tremendou s leap and sat down on each side of him, and
looked savagely at him with their fiery eyes. After a short time, when
they had warmed themselves, they said: ‘Comrade, shall we have a
game of cards?’  ‘Why not?’  he replied, ‘but just show me your
paws.’  Then they stretched out their claws. ‘Oh,’  said he, ‘what long
nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for you.’  Thereupon he
seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board and
screwed their feet fast. ‘I have looked at your fingers,’  said he, ‘and
my fancy for card-p laying has gone,’  and he struck them dead and
threw them  out into the water . But when he had made away with
these two, and was about to sit down  again by his fire, out from
every hole and corner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot
chains, and more and more of them came until he could no longer
move, and they yelled horribly , and got on his fire, pulled it to
pieces, and tried to put it out. He watched them for a while quietly ,
but at last when they were going too far, he seized his cutting-knife,
and cried:  ‘Away with you, vermin,’  and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the others he killed, and threw out into the
fish-pond. When he came back he fanne d the embers of his fire again
and warmed himself. And as he thus sat, his eyes would keep open
no longer , and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he looked round and
saw a great bed in the corner . ‘That is the very thing for me,’ said he,
and got into it. When he was just going to shut his eyes, however , the
bed began to move of its own accord, and went over the whole of the
castle. ‘That’ s right,’  said he, ‘but go faster .’ Then the bed rolled on
as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down, over thresholds
and stairs,  but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside down, and
lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up in the
air, got out and said: ‘Now anyone who likes, may drive,’  and lay
down by his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king
came, and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought
the evil spirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he: ‘After
all it is a pity,—for so handsome a man.’ The youth heard it, got up,
and said: ‘It has not come to that yet.’ Then the king was astonished,
but very glad, and asked how he had fared. ‘Very well indeed,’
answered he; ‘one night is past, the two others will pass likewise.’
Then he went to the innkeeper , who opened his eyes very wide, and
said: ‘I never expected to see you alive again!","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"Have you learnt how
to shudder yet?’  ‘No,’ said he, ‘it is all in vain. If someone would but
tell me!’6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 175/201The second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by
the fire, and once more began his old song: ‘If I could but shudder!’
When midnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was
heard; at first it was low, but it grew louder and louder . Then it was
quiet for a while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came
down the chimney and fell before him. ‘Hullo!’  cried he, ‘another
half belon gs to this. This is not enough!’  Then the uproar began
again, there was a roaring and howling, and the other half fell down
likewise. ‘Wait,’ said he, ‘I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.’
When he had done that and looked round again, the two pieces were
joined together , and a hideous man was sitting in his place. ‘That is
no part of our bargain,’  said the youth, ‘the bench is mine.’  The man
wanted to push him away; the youth, however , would not allow that,
but thrust him off with all his strength,  and seated himself again in
his own place. Then still more men fell down, one after the other;
they brought nine dead men’ s legs and two skulls, and set them up
and playe d at nine-pins with them. The youth also wanted to play
and said: ‘Listen you, can I join you?’  ‘Yes, if you have any money .’
‘Money enough,’  replied he, ‘but your balls are not quite round.’
Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and turned them till
they were round. ‘There, now they will roll better!’  said he. ‘Hurrah! now we’ll  have fun!’  He played with them and lost some of his
money , but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his
sight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the king
came to inquire after him. ‘How has it fared with you this time?’
asked he. ‘I have been playing at nine-pins,’  he answered, ‘and have
lost a couple of farthings.’  ‘Have you not shuddered then?’  ‘What?’
said he, ‘I have had a wonderful time! If I did but know what it was
to shudder!’
The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite
sadly: ‘If I could but shudder .’ When it grew late, six tall men came
in and brought a coffin. Then he said: ‘Ha, ha, that is certainly my
little cousin, who died only a few days ago,’  and he beckoned with
his finger , and cried: ‘Come, little cousin, come.’  They placed the
coffin on the ground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a
dead man lay therein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. ‘Wait,’
said he, ‘I will warm you a little,’  and went to the fire and warmed
his hand and laid it on the dead man’ s face, but he remained cold. Then he took him out, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his
breast and rubbed his arms that the blood might circulate again. As
this also did no good, he thought to himself: ‘When two people lie in
bed together , they warm each other ,’ and carried him to the bed,
covered him over and lay down by him. After a short time the dead
man became warm too, and began to move. Then said the youth,
‘See, little cousin, have I not warmed you?’  The dead man, however ,
got up and cried: ‘Now will I strangle you.’
‘What!’  said he, ‘is that the way you thank me? You shall at once
go into your coffin again,’  and he took him up, threw him into it, and
shut the lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. ‘I
cannot manage to shudder ,’ said he. ‘I shall never learn it here as
long as I live.’
Then a man entered  who was taller than all others, and looked
terrible. He was old, however , and had a long white beard. ‘You6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

shall die.’ ‘Not so fast,’ replied the youth. ‘If I am to die, I shall have
to have a say in it.’ ‘I will soon seize you,’  said the fiend. ‘Softly ,
softly , do not talk so big. I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even
stronger .’ ‘We shall see,’ said the old man. ‘If you are stronger , I will
let you go—come, we will try.’ Then he led him by dark passages to
a smith’s forge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into
the ground. ‘I can do better than that,’  said the youth, and went to the
other anvil. The old man placed himself  near and wanted to look on,
and his white beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe, split
the anvil with one blow , and in it caught the old man’ s beard. ‘Now I
have you,’  said the youth. ‘Now it is your turn to die.’ Then he seized
an iron bar and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to
stop, when  he would give him great riches. The youth drew out the
axe and let him go. The old man led him back into the castle, and in
a cellar showed him three chests full of gold. ‘Of these,’  said he, ‘one
part is for the poor, the other for the king, the third yours.’  In the
meantime it struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the
youth stood in darkness. ‘I shall still be able to find my way out,’
said he, and felt about, found the way into the room, and slept there
by his fire. Next morning the king came and said: ‘Now you must
have learn t what shuddering is?’ ‘No,’  he answered; ‘what can it be? My dead cousin was here, and a bearded man came and showed me a
great deal of money down below , but no one told me what it was to
shudder .’ ‘Then,’  said the king, ‘you have saved the castle, and shall
marry my daughter .’ ‘That is all very well,’  said he, ‘but still I do not
know what it is to shudder!’
Then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but
howsoever much the young king loved his wife, and however happy
he was, he still said always: ‘If I could but shudder—if I could but
shudder .’ And this at last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: ‘I will
find a cure for him; he shall soon learn what it is to shudder .’ She
went out to the stream which flowed through the garden, and had a
whole bucketful of gudgeons brought to her. At night when the
young king was sleeping, his wife was to draw the clothes off him
and empty the bucket full of cold water with the gudgeons in it over
him, so that the little fishes would sprawl about him. Then he woke
up and cried: ‘Oh, what makes me shudder so?—what makes me
shudder so, dear wife?","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who
was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty , and conceited, that
none of the princes who came to ask her in marriage was good
enough for her , and she only made sport of them. Once upon  a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all
her suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their rank—
kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons, and
knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she
had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat:
‘He’s as round as a tub,’ said she. The next was too tall: ‘What a
maypole!’  said she. The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’  said
she. The fourth was too pale, and she called him ‘Wallface.’  The fifth
was too red, so she called him ‘Coxcomb.’  The sixth was not straight
enough; so she said he was like a green  stick, that had been laid to
dry over a baker ’s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon
every one: but she laughed more than all at a good king who was
there. ‘Look at him,’ said she; ‘his beard is like an old mop; he shall
be called Grisly-be ard.’ So the king got the nickname of Grisly-
beard. But the old king was very angry when  he saw how his daughter
behaved, and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that,
willing or unwilling , she should marry the first man, be he prince or
beggar , that came to the door . Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler , who began to
play under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him,
he said, ‘Let him come in.’ So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow;
and when he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a
boon. Then the king said, ‘You have sung so well, that I will give
you my daughter for your wife.’  The princess begged and prayed; but
the king said, ‘I have sworn to give you to the first comer , and I will
keep my word.’  So words and tears were of no avail; the parson was
sent for, and she was married to the fiddler . When this was over the
king said, ‘Now get ready to go—you must not stay here—you must
travel on with your husband.’
Then the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they
soon came to a great wood. ‘Pray ,’ said she, ‘whose is this wood?’  ‘It
belongs to King Grisly-beard,’  answered he; ‘hadst thou taken him,
all had been thine. ’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ sighed she;
‘would that I had married King Grisly-beard!’  Next they came to
some fine meadows. ‘Whose are these beautiful green meadows?’
said she. ‘They belong to King Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him,
they had all been thine.’  ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ said she;
‘would that I had married King Grisly-beard!’
Then they came to a great city. ‘Whose is this noble city?’  said
she. ‘It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all
been thine .’ ‘Ah! wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘why did I not marry6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

‘why shou ld you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough
for you?’
At last they came to a small cottage.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"‘What a paltry place!’  said
she; ‘to whom does that little dirty hole belong?’  Then the fiddler
said, ‘That is your and my house, where we are to live.’  ‘Where are
your servants?’  cried she. ‘What do we want with servants?’  said he;
‘you must do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire,
and put on water and cook my supper , for I am very tired.’  But the
princess knew nothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler
was forced to help her. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they
went to bed; but the fiddler called her up very early in the morning to
clean the house. Thus they lived for two days: and when they had
eaten up all there was in the cottage, the man said, ‘Wife, we can’t
go on thus, spending  money and earnin g nothing. You must learn to
weave baskets.’  Then he went out and cut willows, and brought them
home, and she bega n to weave; but it made her fingers very sore. ‘I
see this work won’ t do,’ said he: ‘try and spin; perhaps you will do
that better.’ So she sat down and tried to spin; but the threads cut her
tender fingers till the blood ran.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"‘See now,’ said the fiddler , ‘you are
good for nothing; you can do no work: what a bargain I have got! However , I’ll try and set up a trade in pots and pans, and you shall
stand in the market and sell them.’  ‘Alas!’  sighed she, ‘if any of my
father ’s court should  pass by and see me standing in the market, how
they will laugh at me!’
But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if
she did not wish to die of hunger . At first the trade went well; for
many people, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares,
and paid their money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived  on this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a
fresh lot of ware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the
market; but a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse
against her stall, and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry, and knew not what to do.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"‘Ah! what will
become of me?’  said she; ‘what will my husband say?’  So she ran
home and told him all. ‘Who would have thought you would have
been so silly,’ said he, ‘as to put an earthenware stall in the corner of
the market, where everybody passes? but let us have no more crying;
I see you are not fit for this sort of work , so I have been to the king’ s
palace, and asked if they did not want a kitchen-maid; and they say
they will take you, and there you will have plenty to eat.’
Thus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to
do all the dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of
the meat that was left, and on this they lived. She had not been there long before she heard that the king’ s eldest
son was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the
windows and looked out. Everything was ready , and all the pomp
and brightness of the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for
the pride and folly which had brought her so low.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

but she trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard,
who was making sport of her. However , he kept fast hold, and led her
in; and the cover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell
about. Then everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so
abashed, that she wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-
beard overtook her, and brought her back and said, ‘Fear me not! I
am the fiddler who has lived with you in the hut.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

There was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his
palace, full of all kinds of wild anim als. One day he sent out a
huntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. ‘Perhaps
some accident has befallen him,’  said the king, and the next day he
sent out two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they
too stayed away . Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen,
and said: ‘Scour the whole forest through, and do not give up until
you have found all three.’  But of these also, none came home again,
none were  seen again. From that time forth, no one would any longer
venture into the forest, and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude,
and nothing was seen of it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying
over it. This lasted  for many years, when an unknown huntsman
announced himself to the king as seeking a situation, and offered to
go into the dangerous forest. The king, however , would not give his
consent, and said: ‘It is not safe in there;  I fear it would fare with you
no better than with the others, and you would never come out again.’
The huntsm an replie d: ‘Lord, I will venture it at my own risk, of fear
I know nothing.’
The hunts man therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way,
and wanted to pursu e it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it
stood before a deep pool, could go no farther , and a naked arm
stretched itself out of the water , seized  it, and drew it under . When
the huntsman saw that, he went back and fetched three men to come
with buck ets and bale out the water . When they could see to the
bottom there lay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron,
and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees. They bound
him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There was great
astonishment over the wild man; the king, however , had him put in
an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened on
pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her
keeping. And from this time forth every one could again go into the
forest with safety . The king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the
courtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the
cage. The boy ran thither and said: ‘Give me my ball out.’ ‘Not till
you have opened the door for me,’ answered the man. ‘No,’  said the
boy, ‘I will not do that; the king has forbidden it,’ and ran away . The
next day he again went and asked for his ball; the wild man said:
‘Open my door,’ but the boy would not. On the third day the king
had ridden out hunting, and the boy went once more and said: ‘I
cannot open the door even if I wished, for I have not the key.’ Then
the wild man said: ‘It lies under your mother ’s pillow , you can get it
there.’  The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to
the winds,  and brought the key. The door opened with difficulty , and
the boy pinched his fingers. When it was open the wild man stepped
out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away . The boy had6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 181/201become afraid; he called and cried after him: ‘Oh, wild man, do not
go away, or I shall be beaten!’  The wild man turned back, took him
up, set him on his shoulder , and went with hasty steps into the forest. When the king came home, he observe d the empty cage, and asked
the queen how that had happened. She knew nothing about it, and
sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one
answered. The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but
they did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had
happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court. When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he
took the boy down from his shoulder , and said to him: ‘You will
never see your father and mother again, but I will keep you with me,
for you have set me free, and I have compassion on you. If you do all
I bid you, you shall fare well. Of treas ure and gold have I enough,
and more than anyo ne in the world.’  He made a bed of moss for the
boy on which he slept, and the next morning the man took him to a
well, and said: ‘Beh old, the gold well is as bright and clear as crystal,
you shall sit beside  it, and take care that nothing falls into it, or it
will be polluted. I will come every even ing to see if you have obeyed
my order .’ The boy placed himself by the brink of the well, and often
saw a golden fish or a golden snake show itself therein, and took care
that nothing fell in. As he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so
violently that he involuntarily put it in the water . He drew it quickly
out again, but saw that it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he
took to wash the gold off again, all was to no purpose. In the evening
Iron Hans came back, looked at the boy, and said: ‘What has
happened to the well?’ ‘Nothing nothing,’  he answered, and held his
finger behind his back, that the man might not see it. But he said:
‘You have dipped your finger into the water , this time it may pass,
but take care you do not again let anything go in.’ By daybreak the
boy was already sitting by the well and watching it. His finger hurt
him again and he passed it over his head, and then unhappily a hair
fell down into the well. He took it quickly out, but it was already
quite gilde d. Iron Hans came, and already knew what had happened. ‘You have  let a hair fall into the well,’  said he. ‘I will allow you to
watch by it once more, but if this happens for the third time then the
well is polluted and you can no longer remain with me.’
On the third day, the boy sat by the well,  and did not stir his finger ,
however much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he
looked at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water . And as
he still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying
to look straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his
shoulders into the water . He raised himself up quickly , but the whole
of the hair of his head was already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine how terrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-
handkerchief and tied it round his head,  in order that the man might
not see it. When he came he already knew everything, and said:
‘Take the handkerchief off.’ Then the golden hair streamed forth, and
let the boy excuse himself as he might,  it was of no use. ‘You have
not stood the trial and can stay here no longer .","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is one thing I will grant

than you think, and I have gold and silver in abundance.’
Then the king’ s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and
unbeaten paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he looked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing
by which he could help himself.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"At length he went to the palace, and
asked if they would take him in. The people about court did not at all
know what use they could make of him, but they liked him, and told
him to stay. At length the cook took him into his service, and said he
might carry wood and water , and rake the cinders together . Once
when it so happened  that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered
him to carry the food to the royal table, but as he did not like to let
his golden hair be seen, he kept his little cap on. Such a thing as that
had never yet come under the king’ s notice, and he said: ‘When you
come to the royal table you must take your hat off.’ He answered:
‘Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad sore place on my head.’  Then the
king had the cook called before him and scolded him, and asked how
he could take such a boy as that into his service; and that he was to
send him away at once. The cook, however , had pity on him, and
exchanged him for the gardener ’s boy . And now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig,
and bear the wind and bad weather . Once in summer when he was
working alone in the garden, the day was so warm he took his little
cap off that the air might cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it
glittered and flashed so that the rays fell into the bedroom of the
king’ s daughter , and up she sprang to see what that could be. Then
she saw the boy, and cried to him: ‘Boy, bring me a wreath of
flowers.’  He put his cap on with all haste, and gathered wild field-
flowers and bound them together . When  he was ascending the stairs
with them , the gardener met him, and said: ‘How can you take the
king’ s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go quickly , and
get another , and seek out the prettiest and rarest.’  ‘Oh, no,’ replied
the boy, ‘the wild ones have more scent, and will please her better .’
When he got into the room, the king’ s daughter said: ‘Take your cap
off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.’  He again said: ‘I
may not, I have a sore head.’  She, however , caught at his cap and
pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his shoulders,
and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she held him
by the arm, and gave him a handfu l of ducats. With these he
departed, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to
the gardener , and said: ‘I present them to your children, they can play
with them .’ The following day the king’ s daughter again called to
him that he was to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he
went in with it, she instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take
it away from him, but he held it fast with both hands. She again gave
him a handful of ducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them
to the gardener for playthings for his children. On the third day
things went just the same; she could not get his cap away from him,
and he would not have her money . Not long afterwards, the country was overrun by war.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"The king
gathered together his people, and did not know whether or not he
could offer any opposition to the enemy , who was superior in
strength and had a mighty army . Then said the gardener ’s boy: ‘I am6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

others laughed, and said: ‘Seek one for yourself when we are gone,
we will leave one behind us in the stable for you.’  When they had
gone forth , he went into the stable, and led the horse out; it was lame
of one foot, and limped hobblety jib, hobblety jib; nevertheless he
mounted it, and rode away to the dark forest. When he came to the
outskirts, he called ‘Iron Hans’  three times so loudly that it echoed
through the trees. Thereupon the wild man appeared immediately ,
and said: ‘What do you desire?’  ‘I want a strong steed, for I am going
to the wars.’  ‘That you shall have, and still more than you ask for.’
Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it was not long
before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that snorted with
its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed
a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and their swords
flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged horse to the
stable-boy , mounted the other , and rode at the head of the soldiers. When he got near the battlefield a great part of the king’ s men had
already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give way. Then
the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like a
hurricane over the enemy , and beat down all who opposed him. They
began to flee, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there
was not a single man left. Instead of returning to the king, however ,
he conducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth
Iron Hans . ‘What do you desire?’  asked the wild man. ‘Take back
your horse and your troops, and give me my three-legged horse
again.’  All that he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his
three-legged horse. When the king returned to his palace, his
daughter went to meet him, and wished him joy of his victory . ‘I am
not the one who carried away the victory,’ said he, ‘but a strange
knight who came to my assistance with his soldiers.’  The daughter
wanted to hear who the strange knigh t was, but the king did not
know , and said: ‘He followed the enemy, and I did not see him
again.’  She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but he
smiled, and said: ‘He has just come home on his three-legged horse,
and the others have been mocking him, and crying: “Here comes our
hobblety jib back again!” They asked, too: “Under what hedge have
you been lying sleeping all the time?” So he said: “I did the best of
all, and it would have gone badly witho ut me.” And then he was still
more ridiculed.’
The king said to his daughter: ‘I will proclaim a great feast that
shall last for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps
the unkno wn man will show hims elf.’ When the feast was
announced, the youth went out to the forest, and called Iron Hans. ‘What do you desire?’  asked he. ‘That I may catch the king’ s
daughter ’s golden apple.’  ‘It is as safe as if you had it already ,’ said
Iron Hans . ‘You shall likewise have a suit of red armour for the
occasion, and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse.’  When the day came,
the youth galloped to the spot, took his place amongst the knights,
and was recognized by no one. The king’s daughter came forward,
and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none of them caught it
but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away . On the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight, and
gave him a white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the
apple, and he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

before me and tell his name.’  He gave the order that if the knight
who caught the apple, should go away again they should pursue him,
and if he would not come back willingly , they were to cut him down
and stab him. On the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black
armour and a black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when
he was riding off with it, the king’ s attendants pursued him, and one
of them got so near him that he woun ded the youth’ s leg with the
point of his sword. The youth nevertheless escaped from them, but
his horse leapt so violently that the helm et fell from the youth’ s head,
and they could see that he had golden hair. They rode back and
announced this to the king. The follow ing day the king’ s daughter asked the gardener about
his boy. ‘He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at
the festival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has
likewise shown my children three golden apples which he has won.’
The king had him summoned into his presence, and he came and
again had his little cap on his head. But the king’ s daughter went up
to him and took it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his
shoulders, and he was so handsome that all were amazed. ‘Are you
the knight who came every day to the festival, always in different
colours, and who caught the three golden apples?’  asked the king. ‘Yes,’ answ ered he, ‘and here the apple s are,’ and he took them out
of his pocket, and returned them to the king. ‘If you desire further
proof, you may see the wound which your people gave me when
they followed me. But I am likewise the knight who helped you to
your victory over your enemies.’  ‘If you can perform such deeds as
that, you are no gardener ’s boy; tell me, who is your father?’  ‘My
father is a mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great as I
require.’  ‘I well see,’ said the king, ‘that I owe my thanks to you; can
I do anything to please you?’  ‘Yes,’ answered he, ‘that indeed you
can. Give me your daughter to wife.’  The maiden laughed, and said:
‘He does not stand much on ceremony , but I have already seen by his
golden hair that he was no gardener ’s boy,’ and then she went and
kissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in
great delig ht, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear
son again.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"

There was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold,
and was so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the
whole face of the earth. But this beaut iful queen fell ill, and when
she felt that her end drew near she called the king to her and said,
‘Promise me that you will never marry again, unless you meet with a
wife who is as beaut iful as I am, and who has golden hair like mine.’
Then when the king in his grief promised all she asked, she shut her
eyes and died. But the king was not to be comforted, and for a long
time never thought of taking another wife. At last, however , his wise
men said, ‘this will not do; the king must marry again, that we may
have a queen.’  So messengers were sent far and wide, to seek for a
bride as beautiful as the late queen. But there was no princess in the
world so beautiful; and if there had been, still there was not one to be
found who had golden hair. So the messengers came home, and had
had all their trouble for nothing. Now the king had a daughter , who was just as beautiful as her
mother , and had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up,
the king looked at her and saw that she was just like this late queen:
then he said to his courtiers, ‘May I not marry my daughter? She is
the very image of my dead wife: unles s I have her, I shall not find
any bride upon the whole earth, and you say there must be a queen.’
When the courtiers heard this they were  shocked, and said, ‘Heaven
forbid that a father should marry his daughter! Out of so great a sin
no good can come.’  And his daughter was also shocked, but hoped
the king would soon give up such thoughts; so she said to him,
‘Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses: one must be of
gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver , like the moon;
and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this, I want a
mantle of a thousan d different kinds of fur put together , to which
every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.’  And thus
she thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made
the most skilful workmen in his kingd om weave the three dresses:
one golden, like the sun; another silver y, like the moon; and a third
sparkling, like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the
beasts in his kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins:
and thus a mantle of a thousand furs was made. When all were ready , the king sent them  to her; but she got up in
the night when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a
golden ring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the
three dress es—of the sun, the moon, and the stars—up in a nutshell,
and wrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and
besmeared her face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself
upon Heaven for help in her need, and went away , and journeyed on
the whole night, till at last she came to a large wood. As she was very
tired, she sat herse lf down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell
asleep: and there she slept on till it was midday .6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 186/201Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his
dogs came  to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and
round, and bark. ‘Look sharp!’  said the king to the huntsmen, ‘and
see what sort of game lies there.’  And the huntsmen went up to the
tree, and when they came back again said, ‘In the hollow tree there
lies a most wonderful beast, such as we never saw before; its skin
seems to be of a thousand kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.’
‘See,’  said the king, ‘if you can catch it alive, and we will take it with
us.’ So the huntsmen took it up, and the maiden awoke and was
greatly frightened, and said, ‘I am a poor child that has neither father
nor mothe r left; have pity on me and take me with you.’  Then they
said, ‘Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will do for the kitchen; you can sweep
up the ashes, and do things of that sort.’  So they put her into the
coach, and took her home to the king’ s palace. Then they showed her
a little corner under the staircase, where no light of day ever peeped
in, and said, ‘Cat-skin, you may lie and sleep there.’  And she was
sent into the kitchen , and made to fetch wood and water , to blow the
fire, pluck  the poultry , pick the herbs, sift the ashes, and do all the
dirty work. Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully . ‘Ah! pretty
princess!’  thought she, ‘what will now become of thee?’  But it
happened one day that a feast was to be held in the king’ s castle, so
she said to the cook, ‘May I go up a little while and see what is going
on? I will take care and stand behind the door.’ And the cook said,
‘Yes, you may go, but be back again in half an hour’s time, to rake
out the ashes.’  Then  she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin,
and took off the fur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and
hands, so that her beauty shone forth like the sun from behind the
clouds. She next opened her nutshell, and brought out of it the dress
that shone like the sun, and so went to the feast. Everyone made way
for her, for nobody knew her, and they thought she could be no less
than a king’ s daught er. But the king came up to her, and held out his
hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, ‘I never saw
any one half so beautiful.’
When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king
looked round for her, she was gone, no one knew wither . The guards
that stood at the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth was, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her
dress, blackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and
was Cat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and
began to rake the ashes, the cook said, ‘Let that alone till the
morning, and heat the king’ s soup; I should like to run up now and
give a peep: but take care you don’t let a hair fall into it, or you will
run a chance of never eating again.’
As soon as the cook  went away , Cat-skin heated the king’ s soup,
and toaste d a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and
when it was ready , she went and looke d in the cabin for her little
golden ring, and put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the
dance was over, the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it
pleased him so well, that he thought he had never tasted any so good
before. At the bottom he saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not
make out how it had got there, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frigh tened when he heard the order , and said to Cat-6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 187/201skin, ‘You must have let a hair fall into the soup; if it be so, you will
have a good beating.’  Then he went before the king, and he asked
him who had cooked the soup. ‘I did,’ answered the cook. But the
king said, ‘That is not true; it was better done than you could do it.’
Then he answered, ‘To tell the truth I did not cook it, but Cat-skin
did.’ ‘Then  let Cat-skin come up,’ said the king: and when she came
he said to her, ‘Who are you?’  ‘I am a poor child,’  said she, ‘that has
lost both father and mother .’ ‘How came you in my palace?’  asked
he. ‘I am good for nothing,’  said she, ‘but to be scullion-girl, and to
have boots  and shoes thrown at my head.’  ‘But how did you get the
ring that was in the soup?’  asked the king. Then she would not own
that she knew anything about the ring; so the king sent her away
again about her business. After a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook
to let her go up and see it as before. ‘Y es,’ said he, ‘but come again in
half an hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.’  Then
she ran to her little cabin, washed herse lf quickly , and took her dress
out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went
in, lookin g like a king’ s daughter , the king went up to her, and
rejoiced at seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced
with her. After the dance was at an end she managed to slip out, so
slyly that the king did not see where she was gone; but she sprang
into her little cabin, and made herself into Cat-skin again, and went
into the kitchen to cook the soup. Whil st the cook was above stairs,
she got the golden necklace and dropped it into the soup; then it was
brought to the king, who ate it, and it pleased him as well as before;
so he sent for the cook, who was again forced to tell him that Cat-
skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was brought again before the king, but
she still told him that she was only fit to have boots and shoes
thrown at her head. But when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third
time, it happened just the same as before. ‘You must be a witch, Cat-
skin,’  said the cook; ‘for you always put something into your soup,
so that it pleases the king better than mine.’ However , he let her go
up as before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars,
and went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again,
and thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So
whilst he was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger
without her seeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a
long time. When it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the
hand, but she slippe d away , and sprang so quickly through the crowd
that he lost sight of her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little
cabin under the stairs. But this time she kept away too long, and
stayed beyond the half-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine
dress, and threw her fur mantle over it, and in her haste did not
blacken herself all over with soot, but left one of her fingers white. Then she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king’ s soup; and as
soon as the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called
once more , and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had
put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept
fast hold of it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away ,6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm

be the most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the
king said, ‘You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be

There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In
front of the cottage was a garden where in stood two rose-trees, one
of which bore white and the other red roses. She had two children
who were like the two rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white,
and the other Rose-red. They were as good and happy , as busy and
cheerful as ever two children in the world were, only Snow-white
was more quiet and gentle than Rose-red. Rose-red liked better to
run about in the meadows and fields seeking flowers and catching
butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home  with her mother , and helped
her with her housework, or read to her when there was nothing to do. The two children were so fond of one another that they always
held each other by the hand when they went out together , and when
Snow-white said: ‘We will not leave each other ,’ Rose-red answered:
‘Never so long as we live,’  and their mother would add: ‘What one
has she must share with the other .’
They often ran abou t the forest alone and gathered red berries, and
no beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully . The
little hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed
by their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still
upon the boughs, and sang whatever they knew . No mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest,
and night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon
the moss, and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this
and did not worry on their account. Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had
roused them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress
sitting near their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but
said nothi ng and went into the forest. And when they looked round
they found that they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and
would certainly have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone
only a few paces further . And their mother told them that it must
have been the angel who watches over good children. Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother’s little cottage so neat
that it was a pleasur e to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took
care of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her
mother ’s bed before  she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The kettle was of brass and shone like gold, so brightly was it
polished. In the evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said:
‘Go, Snow -white, and bolt the door,’ and then they sat round the
hearth, and the mother took her specta cles and read aloud out of a
large book , and the two girls listened as they sat and spun. And close
by them lay a lamb upon the floor , and behind them upon a perch sat
a white dove with its head hidden beneath its wings. One evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together ,
someone knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 190/201said: ‘Quick, Rose-r ed, open the door, it must be a traveller who is
seeking shelter.’ Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking
that it was a poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his
broad, black head within the door . Rose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove
fluttered, and Snow -white hid herself behind her mother ’s bed. But
the bear began to speak and said: ‘Do not be afraid, I will do you no
harm! I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside
you.’
‘Poor bear,’ said the mother , ‘lie down by the fire, only take care
that you do not burn your coat.’  Then she cried: ‘Snow-white, Rose-
red, come out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.’  So they
both came  out, and by-and-by the lamb  and dove came nearer , and
were not afraid of him. The bear said: ‘Here, children, knock the
snow out of my coat a little’; so they brought the broom and swept
the bear’s hide clean; and he stretched himself by the fire and
growled contentedly  and comfortably . It was not long before they
grew quite at home,  and played tricks with their clumsy guest. They
tugged his hair with their hands, put their feet upon his back and
rolled him about, or they took a hazel-switch and beat him, and when
he growled they laughed. But the bear took it all in good part, only
when they were too rough he called out: ‘Leave me alive, children,
  Snow-white, Rose-red,
  Will you beat your wooer dead?’
When it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said
to the bear: ‘You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be
safe from the cold and the bad weather .’ As soon as day dawned the
two childr en let him out, and he trotted across the snow into the
forest. Henceforth the bear came every eveni ng at the same time, laid
himself down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves
with him as much as they liked; and they got so used to him that the
doors were never fastened until their black friend had arrived. When spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said
one morning to Snow-white: ‘Now I must go away , and cannot come
back for the whole summer .’ ‘Where are you going, then, dear bear?’
asked Snow-white. ‘I must go into the forest and guard my treasures
from the wicked dwarfs. In the winter , when the earth is frozen hard,
they are obliged to stay below and cannot work their way through;
but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed the earth, they break
through it, and come out to pry and steal; and what once gets into
their hands, and in their caves, does not easily see daylight again.’
Snow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted
the door for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against
the bolt and a piece  of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to
Snow-white as if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was
not sure about it. The bear ran away quickly , and was soon out of
sight behind the trees. A short time afterwa rds the mother sent her children into the forest
to get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the
ground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards
and forwa rds in the grass, but they could not make out what it was.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 191/201When they came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face
and a snow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught
in a crevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping about like a
dog tied to a rope, and did not know what to do. He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried: ‘Why do
you stand there? Can you not come here and help me?’  ‘What are
you up to, little man?’  asked Rose-red. ‘You stupid, prying goose!’
answered the dwarf: ‘I was going to split the tree to get a little wood
for cooking. The little bit of food that we people get is immediately
burnt up with heavy  logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse,
greedy folk. I had just driven the wedge safely in, and everything
was going  as I wish ed; but the cursed wedge was too smooth and
suddenly sprang out, and the tree closed so quickly that I could not
pull out my beautifu l white beard; so now it is tight and I cannot get
away , and the silly, sleek, milk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious
you are!’
The children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out,
it was caught too fast. ‘I will run and fetch someone,’  said Rose-red. ‘You senseless goose!’  snarled the dwarf; ‘why should you fetch
someone? You are already two too many for me; can you not think of
something better?’  ‘Don’ t be impatient,’  said Snow-white, ‘I will
help you,’  and she pulled her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off
the end of the beard. As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which
lay among st the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and
lifted it up, grumbling to himself: ‘Uncouth people, to cut off a piece
of my fine beard. Bad luck to you!’  and then he swung the bag upon
his back, and went of f without even once looking at the children. Some time afterwards Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a
dish of fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a
large grass hopper jumping towards the water , as if it were going to
leap in. They ran to it and found it was the dwarf. ‘Where are you
going?’  said Rose-red; ‘you surely don’t want to go into the water?’
‘I am not such a fool!’  cried the dwarf; ‘don’ t you see that the
accursed fish wants  to pull me in?’ The little man had been sitting
there fishing, and unluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with
the fishing-line; a moment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble
creature had not strength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand
and pulled the dwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and
rushes, but it was of little good, for he was forced to follow the
movements of the fish, and was in urgent danger of being dragged
into the water . The girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his
beard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled
fast together . There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors
and cut the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the
dwarf saw that he screamed out: ‘Is that civil, you toadstool, to
disfigure a man’ s face? Was it not enou gh to clip off the end of my
beard? Now you have cut off the best part of it.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"I cannot let myself
be seen by my people. I wish you had been made to run the soles off
your shoes!’  Then he took out a sack of pearls which lay in the
rushes, and without another word he dragged it away and
disappeared behind a stone.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 192/201It happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children
to the town to buy needles and thread,  and laces and ribbons. The
road led them across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay
strewn about.","Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm.pdf"
"There they noticed a large bird hovering in the air,
flying slowly round and round above them; it sank lower and lower ,
and at last settled near a rock not far away. Immediately they heard a
loud, piteo us cry. They ran up and saw with horror that the eagle had
seized their old acquaintance the dwarf, and was going to carry him
off. The childr en, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man,
and pulled  against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go. As soon as the dwar f had recovered from  his first fright he cried with
his shrill voice: ‘Could you not have done it more carefully! You
dragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you
clumsy creatures!’  Then he took up a sack full of precious stones,
and slipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who
by this time were used to his ingratitude, went on their way and did
their business in town. As they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised
the dwarf,  who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean
spot, and had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The
evening sun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and
sparkled with all colours so beautifully that the children stood still
and stared  at them. ‘Why do you stand gaping there?’  cried the
dwarf, and his ashen -grey face became copper -red with rage. He was
still cursing when a loud growling was heard, and a black bear came
trotting towards them out of the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a
fright, but he could not reach his cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart he cried: ‘Dear Mr Bear, spare me, I
will give you all my treasures; look, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you want with such a slender little fellow
as I? you would not feel me between your teeth. Come, take these
two wicked girls, they are tender morsels for you, fat as young
quails; for mercy’ s sake eat them!’  The bear took no heed of his
words, but gave the wicked creature a single blow with his paw, and
he did not move again. The girls had run away , but the bear called to them: ‘Snow-white
and Rose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.’  Then
they recog nized his voice and waited, and when he came up to them
suddenly his bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man,
clothed all in gold. ‘I am a king’ s son,’  he said, ‘and I was bewitched
by that wicked dwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run
about the forest as a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now
he has got his well-deserved punishment. Snow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother , and
they divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had
gathered together in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and
happily with her children for many years. She took the two rose-trees
with her, and they stood before her window, and every year bore the
most beautiful roses, white and red.6/26/24, 2:14 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Grimms’ Fairy Tales, by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2591/pg2591-images.html 193/201The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and
Wilhelm (1786-1859), were born in Hanau, near
Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse. Throughout their lives they remained close friends,
and both studied law at Marburg University. Jacob
was a pioneer in the study of German philology,
and although Wilhelm’s work was hampered by
poor health the brothers collaborated in the
creation of a German dictionary, not completed
until a century after their deaths. But they were
best (and universally) known for the collection of
over two hundred folk tales they made from oral
sources and published in two volumes of ‘Nursery
and Household Tales’ in 1812 and 1814. Although
their intention was to preserve such material as
part of German cultural and literary history, and
their collection was first published with scholarly
notes and no illustration, the tales soon came into
the possession of young readers. This was in part
due to Edgar Taylor, who made the first English
translation in 1823, selecting about fifty stories
‘with the amusement of some young friends
principally in view.’ They have been an essential
ingredient of children’s reading ever since. *** END OF THE PROJECT  GUTENBERG EBOOK GRIMMS'

"ETYMOLOGY . (Supplied by a Late Consumptive Usher to a
Grammar School.)
The pale Usher—thr eadbare in coat, heart, body , and brain; I see him now. He
was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer handkerchief ,
mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the known nations of the
world. He loved to dust his old grammars; it somehow mildly reminded him of
his mortality . “While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what name a
whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out, through ignorance, the letter
H, which almost alone maketh up the signification of the word, you deliver that
which is not true.” — Hackluyt. “WHALE. * * * Sw. and Dan.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

"(Supplied by a Sub-
Sub-Librarian). It will be seen that this mere painstakin g burrower and grub-worm of a poor
devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans and street-
stalls of the earth, picking up whateve r random allusions to whales he could
anyways find in any book whatsoever , sacred or profane. Therefore you must
not, in every case at least, take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, howeve r
authentic, in these extracts, for verita ble gospel cetology . Far from it. As
touching the ancient  authors generally , as well as the poets here appearing, these
extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing bird’ s eye
view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied, and sung of
Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our own. So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am. Thou
belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this world will ever
warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong; but with whom
one sometimes loves to sit, and feel poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon
tears; and say to them bluntly , with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not
altogether unpleasan t sadness—Give it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the
more pains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for ever go
thankless! Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye! But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts; for
your friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens ,
and making refugees of long-pampered  Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, agains t
your coming. Here ye strike but splintered hearts together—there, ye shall strike
unsplinterable glasses! EXTRACTS.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

     The wind was piping free;

Sperm Whale rolls over and over; he rears his enormous head, and with wide
expanded jaws snaps at everything around him; he rushes at the boats with his
head; they are prope lled before him with vast swiftness, and sometimes utterly
destroyed.... It is a matter of great astonishment that the consideration of the
habits of so interes ting, and, in a commercial point of view , so important an
animal (as the Sperm Whale) should have been so entirely neglected, or should
have excited so little curiosity amon g the numerous, and many of them
competent observers, that of late years, must have possessed the most abundant
and the most conven ient opportunities of witnessing their habitudes.” —Thomas

Whale” (Greenland or Right Whale) “in possessing a formidable weapon at
either extremity of its body , but also more frequently displays a disposition to
employ these weapo ns offensively and in manner at once so artful, bold, and
mischievous, as to lead to its being regarded as the most dangerous to attack of

"Loomings. Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—nev er mind how long precisely—having
little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I
thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a
way I have of drivin g off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I
find myse lf growin g grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly
November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before
coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and
especially whenever  my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a
strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street ,
and methodically knocking people’ s hats off—then, I account it high time to get
to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a
philosophical flouris h Cato throws hims elf upon his sword; I quietly take to the
ship. There is nothin g surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in
their degre e, some time or other , cheris h very nearly the same feelings towards
the ocean with me. There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as
Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left,
the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery , where that
noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours
previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water -gazers there. Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears
Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence , by Whitehall, northward. What do you
see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon
thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the
spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

seaward peep. But these are all landsm en; of week days pent up in lath and
plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water , and
seemingly bound for a dive. Strange ! Nothing will content them but the
extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses
will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can
without falling in. And there they stand—miles of them—leagues. Inlanders all,
they come  from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues—north, east, south, and
west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of
the compasses of all those ships attract them thither? Once more.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take
almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and
leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most
absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries—stand that man on his
legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water , if water there
be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try
this experiment, if your caravan happ en to be supplied with a metaphysica l
professor . Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever . But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest,
most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is
the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as
if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow , and there
sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into
distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of
mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced,
and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd’ s
head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’ s eye were fixed upon the magic
stream before him. Go visit the Prairie s in June, when for scores on scores of
miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting? —Water—there is not a drop of water  there! Were Niagara but a cataract of
sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of
Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver , deliberate whether to
buy him a coat, which he sadly needed,  or invest his money in a pedestrian trip
to Rockaw ay Beach ? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robus t
healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your
first voya ge as a passenger , did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration ,
when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did
the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity ,
and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper
the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the
tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of
the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all. Now , when I say that I am in the habit  of going to sea whenever I begin to
grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not
mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger . For to go as a
passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have
something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’ t
sleep of nights—do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never
go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a
Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 15/353such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable
respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever . It is quite as
much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques,
brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,—though I confess
there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—
yet, somehow , I never fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously
buttered, and judgm atically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak
more respectfully , not to say reverentially , of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out
of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river
horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the
pyramids. No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor , right before the mast, plumb
down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather
order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in
a May meadow . And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches
one’s sense of honor , particularly if you come of an old established family in the
land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if
just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a
country schoolmast er, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The
transition is a keen  one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor , and
requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and
bear it. But even this wears of f in time.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and
sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in
the scales  of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks
anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks
in that particular instance? Who ain’t a slave?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Tell me that. Well, then, howeve r
the old sea-captains  may order me about—however they may thump and punch
me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody
else is one way or other served in much  the same way—either in a physical or
metaphysical point of view , that is; and so the universal thump is passed round ,
and all hands should rub each other ’s shoulder -blades, and be content. Again, I always go to sea as a sailor , because they make a point of paying me
for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever
heard of. On the contrary , passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the
difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act of paying is
perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed
upon us. But being paid,—what will compare with it? The urbane activity with
which a man recei ves money is really marvellous, considering that we so
earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account
can a monied man enter heaven. Ah!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"how cheerfully we consign ourselves to
perdition! Finally , I always go to sea as a sailor , because of the wholesome exercise and
pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more
prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean
maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter -deck gets his
atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he
breathes it first; but not so.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"In much the same way do the commonalty lead their
leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchan t
sailor , I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the
invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and
secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way—he can bette r6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 16/353answer than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage,
formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long
time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive
performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like
this:
“Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States. “WHALING VOY AGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY  BATTLE IN
AFFGHANIST AN.”
Though I cannot tell why it was exactly  that those stage managers, the Fates,
put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set
down for magnificen t parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in gentee l
comedies, and jolly parts in farces—though I cannot tell why this was exactly;
yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the
springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under variou s
disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me
into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewil l
and discriminating judgment. Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale
himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity . Then
the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable,
nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand
Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With other men,
perhaps, such things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am
tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden
seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to
perceive a horror , and could still be social with it—would they let me—since it
is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in. By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great
flood-gates of the wonder -world swun g open, and in the wild conceits that
swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul,
endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded
phantom, like a snow hill in the air . CHAPTER 2.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Carpet-Bag. I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and
started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto, I
duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in December . Much was I
disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already
sailed, and that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following
Monday . As most young cand idates for the pains  and penalties of whaling stop at this
same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be related
that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made up to sail in no
other than a Nantuc ket craft, because there was a fine, boisterous something
about everything connected with that famous old island, which amazingly
pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually
monopolising the business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 17/353Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original—the
Tyre of this Carthage;—the place where the first dead American whale was
stranded. Where else but from Nantuc ket did those aboriginal whalemen, the
Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan? And where but
from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden
with imported cobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, in order
to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit? Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New
Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of
concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very dubious -
looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless. I knew
no one in the place. With anxious grapn els I had sounded my pocket, and only
brought up a few pieces of silver ,—So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to
myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and
comparing the gloom towards the north  with the darkness towards the south—
wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear
Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don’ t be too particular . With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “The Crossed
Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further on, from the
bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there came such fervent rays, that
it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house, for
everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic
pavement,—rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the flinty
projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were
in a most miserable plight. Too expensiv e and jolly, again thought I, pausing one
moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the
tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t you hear? get
away from before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I
went. I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there ,
doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns. Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness , not houses, on either hand, and here
and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At this hour of the
night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town proved all but
deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide
building, the door of which stood invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it
were meant for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to
stumble over an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particle s
almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah? But
“The Cros sed Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, then must needs be the
sign of “The Trap.” However , I picke d myself up and hearing a loud voice
within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door . It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black faces
turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of Doom was
beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the preacher ’s text was
about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-
gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at
the sign of ‘The Trap!’
Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks, and
heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging sign over the
door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty
spray , and these words underneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Cof fin.”
Coffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this Peter here is6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 18/353an emigra nt from there. As the light looked so dim, and the place, for the time,
looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it
might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the
swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was
the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea cof fee. It was a queer sort of place—a gable-en ded old house, one side palsied as it
were, and leaning over sadly . It stood on a sharp bleak corner , where that
tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about
poor Paul’ s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr
to any one in-doors,  with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging
of that tempestuous  wind called Euroc lydon,” says an old writer—of whose
works I possess the only copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference ,
whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the
outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window , where the frost
is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier .” True enough,
thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind—old black-letter , thou reasonest
well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house. What a
pity they didn’ t stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little
lint here and there.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The
universe is finished;  the copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million
years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his
pillow , and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears
with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the
tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken wrapper
—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty night; how
Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their oriental summer
climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege of making my own
summer with my own coals. But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm  his blue hands by holding them up to
the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator ;
yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost? Now , that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door
of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceber g should be moored to one of
the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made
of frozen sighs, and being a president of a temperance society , he only drinks the
tepid tears of orphans. But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is
plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet, and see
what sort of a place this “Spouter” may be. CHAPTER 3.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Spouter -Inn. Entering that gable-ended Spouter -Inn,  you found yourself in a wide, low,
straggling entry with old-fashioned wain scots, reminding one of the bulwarks of
some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oilpainting so
thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by
which you viewed it, it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic
visits to it, and caref ul inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 19/353an unders tanding of its purpose. Such  unaccountable masses of shades and
shadows, that at first you almost thoug ht some ambitious young artist, in the
time of the New England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched . But by dint of much and earnest contem plation, and oft repeated ponderings, and
especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry , you
at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might not be
altogether unwarranted. But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber , portentous,
black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue,
dim, perpe ndicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy , soggy , squitchy
picture truly, enough  to drive a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of
indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to
it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that
marvellous painting  meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea
would dart you through.—It’ s the Black Sea in a midnight gale.—It’ s the
unnatural combat of the four primal elements.—It’ s a blasted heath.—It’ s a
Hyperborean winter  scene.—It’ s the breaking-up of the icebound stream of
Time. But at last all these fancies yielde d to that one portentous something in the
picture’ s midst.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"That once found out, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it
not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself? In fact, the artist’ s design seemed this: a final theory of my own, partly based
upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I conversed
upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a great hurricane; the
half-foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible;
and an exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the
enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads. The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of
monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with glittering teeth
resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and one
was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in
the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower . You shuddered as you gazed, and
wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death -
harvesting with such a hacking, horrify ing implement. Mixed with these were
rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were
storied weapons. With this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago
did Natha n Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that
harpoon—so like a corkscrew now—wa s flung in Javan seas, and run away with
by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron
entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man,
travelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the hump. Crossing this dusky entry , and on through yon low-arched way—cut through
what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all
round—you enter the public room. A still duskier place is this, with such low
ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you would
almost fancy you trod some old craft’ s cockpits, especially of such a howling
night, when this corner -anchored old ark rocked so furiously . On one side stood
a long, low, shelf-li ke table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty
rarities gathered from this wide world ’s remotest nooks. Projecting from the
further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den—the bar—a rude attempt at
a right whale’ s head. Be that how it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the
whale’ s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive beneath it. Within are shabby
shelves, ranged round with old decante rs, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of
swift destr uction, like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

sailors deliriums and death. Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true
cylinders without—within, the villano us green goggling glasses deceitfully
tapered downwards to a cheating bottom . Parallel meridians rudely pecked into
the glass, surround these footpads’  goblets. Fill to this mark, and your charge is
but a penny; to this a penny more; and so on to the full glass—the Cape Horn
measure, which you may gulp down for a shilling. Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a
table, exam ining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander . I sought the
landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room, received
for answe r that his house was full—n ot a bed unoccupied. “But avast,” he
added, tapping his forehead, “you haint  no objections to sharing a harpooneer ’s
blanket, have ye? I s’pose you are goin’ a-whalin’, so you’d better get used to
that sort of thing.”
I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should ever do so, it
would depend upon  who the harpooneer might be, and that if he (the landlord)
really had no other place for me, and the harpooneer was not decidedly
objectionable, why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a
night, I would put up with the half of any decent man’ s blanket. “I thought so.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"All right; take a seat. Supper?—you want supper? Supper ’ll be
ready directly .”
I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the
Battery . At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack-
knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he didn’ t make much
headway , I thought. At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining
room. It was cold as Iceland—no fire at all—the landlord said he couldn’ t afford
it. Nothing  but two dismal tallow candles, each in a winding sheet. We were fain
to button up our monkey jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with
our half frozen fingers. But the fare was of the most substantial kind—not only
meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One
young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a
most direful manner . “My boy ,” said the landlord, “you’ll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty .”
“Landlord,” I whispered, “that aint the harpooneer is it?”
“Oh, no,” said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny , “the harpooneer is a
dark comp lexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he don’t—he eats nothing
but steaks, and he likes ’em rare.”
“The devil he does,” says I. “Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?”
“He’ll be here afore long,” was the answer . I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this “dark complexioned”
harpooneer . At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we
should sleep together , he must undress and get into bed before I did. Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not
what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a
looker on. Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord cried,
“That’ s the Grampus’ s crew . I seed her reported in the offing this morning; a6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 21/353three years’  voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now we’ll have the latest
news from the Feegees.”
A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open, and
in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats,
and with their head s muffled in woolle n comforters, all bedarned and ragged ,
and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from
Labrador . They had just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they
entered. No wonder , then, that they made a straight wake for the whale’ s mouth
—the bar—when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured
them out brimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon
which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore
was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever , never mind of how
long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador , or on the weather
side of an ice-island. The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even with the
arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering about most
obstreperously . I observed , howeve r, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he
seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity  of his shipmates by his own sober face,
yet upon the whole  he refrained from making as much noise as the rest. This
man intere sted me at once; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should
soon become my shipmate (though but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this
narrative is concerned), I will here venture upon a little description of him. He
stood full six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam . I have seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt,
making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of
his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy. His
voice at once announced that he was a Southerner , and from his fine stature, I
thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in
Virginia. When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this
man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my
comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however , he was missed by his shipmates,
and being , it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a
cry of “Bulkington! Bulkington! where’ s Bulkington?” and darted out of the
house in pursuit of him. It was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally
quiet after these orgies, I began to congr atulate myself upon a little plan that had
occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen. No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal rather
not sleep with your own brother . I don’t know how it is, but people like to be
private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown
stranger , in a strange  inn, in a strange town, and that stranger a harpooneer , then
your objec tions indefinitely multiply . Nor was there any earthly reason why I as
a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more  than anybody else; for sailors no more
sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all
sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and cover
yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin. The more I pondered over this harpooneer , the more I abominated the thought
of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer , his linen or
woollen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of the
finest. I began to twitch all over.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Besides, it was getting late, and my decent
harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 22/353tumble in upon me at midnight—how could I tell from what vile hole he had
been coming? “Landlord!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"I’ve changed my mind abou t that harpooneer .—I shan’ t sleep with
him. I’ll try the bench here.”
“Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress, and
it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots and notches. “But wait a
bit, Skrimshander; I’ve got a carpenter ’s plane there in the bar—wait, I say, and
I’ll make ye snug enough.” So saying he procured the plane; and with his old
silk handkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my
bed, the while grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last
the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was near
spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven’ s sake to quit—the bed was soft
enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in the world could
make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the shavings with another
grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went
about his business, and left me in a brown study . I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too short;
but that could be mended with a chair . But it was a foot too narrow , and the other
bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one—so there
was no yoking them. I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only
clear space against the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my back to
settle down in. But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over
me from under the sill of the window , that this plan would never do at all,
especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the
window , and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate
vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night. The devil fetch that harpooneer , thought I, but stop, couldn’ t I steal a march
on him—bolt his door inside, and jump  into his bed, not to be wakened by the
most viole nt knock ings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon second thoughts I
dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next morning, so soon as I popped
out of the room, the harpooneer might be standing in the entry , all ready to
knock me down! Still, looking round  me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a
sufferable night unless in some other person’ s bed, I began to think that after all
I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown
harpooneer . Thinks I, I’ll wait awhile; he must be dropping in before long. I’ll
have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good
bedfellows after all—there’ s no telling. But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes, and
going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer . “Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap  is he—does he always keep such late
hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o’clock. The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be mightily
tickled at something beyond my compre hension. “No,” he answered, “generally
he’s an early bird— airley to bed and airley to rise—yes, he’s the bird what
catches the worm. But to-night he went out a peddling, you see, and I don’t see
what on airth keeps him so late, unless, may be, he can’ t sell his head.”
“Can’ t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are
telling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say, landlord, that
this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night, or rather Sunday
morning, in peddling his head around this town?”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 23/353“That’ s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn’ t sell it here,
the market’ s overstocked.”
“With what?” shouted I. “With heads to be sure; ain’ t there too many heads in the world?”
“I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I quite calmly , “you’d better stop
spinning that yarn to me—I’m not green.”
“May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I rayther
guess you’ll be done brown if that ere harpoon eer hears you a slanderin’  his
head.”
“I’ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at this
unaccountable farrago of the landlord’ s. “It’s broke a’ready ,” said he. “Broke,” said I—“ broke, do you mean?”
“Sartain, and that’ s the very reason he can’ t sell it, I guess.”
“Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a snow-storm
—“landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one another , and that too
without delay . I come to your house and want a bed; you tell me you can only
give me half a one; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer . And abou t
this harpooneer , whom I have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most
mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable
feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow—a sort of
connexion, landlord , which is an intimate and confidential one in the highes t
degree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this
harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with
him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay that story about
selling his head, which if true I take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is
stark mad, and I’ve no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, you I mean,
landlord, you, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly , would thereby
render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”
“Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that’ s a purty long sarmon
for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy, this here
harpooneer I have been tellin’  you of has just arrived from the south seas, where
he bought up a lot of ’balmed New Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and
he’s sold all on ’em but one, and that one he’s trying to sell to-night, cause to-
morrow’ s Sunday , and it would not do to be sellin’  human heads about the
streets when folks is goin’  to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday , but I stopped
him just as he was goin’  out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for all
the airth like a string of inions.”
This account cleared up the otherwise  unaccountable mystery , and showed
that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at the same time
what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into
the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of
dead idolators? “Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”
“He pays reg’lar ,” was the rejoinder . “But come, it’s getting dreadful late, you
had better be turning flukes—it’ s a nice bed; Sal and me slept in that ere bed the
night we were splice d. There’ s plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed;
it’s an almighty big bed that. Why , afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam
and little Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one
night, and somehow , Sam got pitched on the floor , and came near breaking his
arm. Arter that, Sal said it wouldn’ t do. Come along here, I’ll give ye a glim in a6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 24/353jiffy;” and so saying  he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead
the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner , he
exclaimed “I vum it’s Sunday—you won’ t see that harpooneer to-night; he’s
come to anchor somewhere—come along then; do come; won’ t ye come?”
I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was
ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a
prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep
abreast. “There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did
double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make yourself comfortable
now, and good night to ye.” I turned round from eyeing the bed, but he had
disappeared. Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the
most elega nt, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced round the
room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no other furniture
belonging to the place, but a rude shelf , the four walls, and a papered fireboard
representing a man striking a whale. Of things not properly belonging to the
room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner;
also a large seaman ’s bag, containing the harpooneer ’s wardrobe, no doubt in
lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hook s
on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the
bed. But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the light, and
felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory
conclusion concerni ng it. I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat,
ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained
porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the
middle of this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it
be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the
streets of any Chris tian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to try it, and it
weighed me down like a hamper , being uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I
thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it
of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never
saw such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave
myself a kink in the neck. I sat down  on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this head-
peddling harpooneer , and his door mat. After thinking some time on the bed-
side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle of the
room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a little more in my shirt
sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as I was, and
remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer ’s not coming home at
all that night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my
pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and
commended myself to the care of heaven. Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery , there is
no telling,  but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a long time. At
last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards
the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a
glimmer of light come into the room from under the door . Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer , the infernal head-peddler . But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word till spoken to. Holding a
light in one hand, and that identical New  Zealand head in the other , the strange r6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 25/353entered the room, and without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good
way off from me on the floor in one corner , and then began working away at the
knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all
eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in
unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accompl ished, however , he turned round—when,
good heavens! what a sight!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish, yellow
colour , here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares. Yes, it’s
just as I thought, he’s a terrible bedfell ow; he’s been in a fight, got dreadfully
cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn
his face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-
plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort
or other .","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"At first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth
occurred to me. I remembered a story of a white man—a whaleman too—who ,
falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that this
harpooneer , in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with a simila r
adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"It’s only his outside; a man can be
honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion,
that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the
squares of tattooing . To be sure, it migh t be nothing but a good coat of tropical
tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish
yellow one. However , I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun
there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now , while all these
ideas were passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me
at all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling
in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the
hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took
the New Zealand head—a ghastly thing enough—and crammed it down into the
bag. He now took off his hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out
with fresh  surprise. There was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—
nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish
head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the strange r
stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I
bolted a dinner . Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window , but it was
the second floor back. I am no coward,  but what to make of this head-peddling
purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance is the parent of
fear, and being completely nonplussed  and confounded about the stranger , I
confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had
thus broken into my room at the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him
that I was not game  enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory
answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him. Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his
chest and arms. As I live, these covere d parts of him were checkered with the
same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same dark squares; he
seemed to have been in a Thirty Years’ War, and just escaped from it with a
sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark
green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain
that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman
in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country . I quaked to think of it.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might take a
fancy to mine—heavens!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"look at that tomahawk! But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about
something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that he6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 26/353must indee d be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught ,
which he had previously hung on a chair , he fumbled in the pockets, and
produced at length a curious little deform ed image with a hunch on its back, and
exactly the colour of a three days’  old Congo baby . Remembering the embalmed
head, at first I almos t thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved
in some similar manner . But seeing that it was not at all limber , and that it
glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing
but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to
the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little
hunch-backed image , like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs
and all the bricks inside were very sooty , so that I thought this fire-place made a
very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol. I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill at
ease mean time—to see what was next to follow . First he takes about a double
handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places them carefully before the
idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the
lamp, he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently , after many hasty
snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he
seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the
biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it to
the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at
all; he never moved  his lips. All these strange antics were accompanied by still
stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-
song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other , during which his face
twitched about in the most unnatural manner . At last extinguishing the fire, he
took the idol up very unceremoniously , and bagged it again in his grego pocket
as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock. All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him
now exhib iting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and
jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never , before the
light was put out, to break the spell in which I had so long been bound. But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one. Taking up
his tomaha wk from the table, he examined the head of it for an instant, and then
holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of
tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was extinguished, and this wild
cannibal, tomahawk  between his teeth,  sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I
could not help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began
feeling me. Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against
the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep
quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural response s
satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning. “Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.”
And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark. “Landlord, for God’ s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. “Landlord! Watch! Coffin! Angels! save me!”
“Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again growled the
cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco
ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire. But thank heaven, at
that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand, and leaping from the
bed I ran up to him.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

harm a hair of your head.”
“Stop your grinning,” shouted I, “and why didn’ t you tell me that that infernal
harpooneer was a cannibal?”
“I thought ye know ’d it;—didn’ t I tell ye, he was a peddlin’  heads around
town?—but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look here—you sabbee
me, I sabbee—you this man sleepe you—you sabbee?”
“Me sabbe e plenty”—grunted Queequeg , puffing away at his pipe and sitting
up in bed. “You gette e in,” he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and throwing
the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and
charitable way.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"I stood looking at him a moment. For all his tattooings he was on
the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal. What’ s all this fuss I have been
making about, thoug ht I to myself—the man’ s a human being just as I am: he
has just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep
with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian. “Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever
you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn in with him. But I
don’t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It’s dangerous. Besides, I
ain’t insured.”
This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely
motioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to say—“I
won’ t touch a leg of ye.”
“Good night, landlord,” said I, “you may go.”
I turned in, and never slept better in my life. CHAPTER 4.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Counterpane. Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg’ s arm thrown
over me in the most loving and affectionate manner . You had almost thought I
had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little parti-
coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an
interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one
precise shade—owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in
sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times—this same
arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork
quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly
tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the
sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me. My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a child, I
well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me; whether it was a
reality or a dream, I never could entirely  settle. The circumstance was this. I had
been cutting up some caper or other— I think it was trying to crawl up the
chimney , as I had seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmothe r
who, somehow or other , was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed
supperless,—my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed
me off to bed, though it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,
the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully . But there was no6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 28/353help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor , undressed
myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between
the sheets. I lay there  dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I
could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small of my back ached
to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun shining in at the window , and a
great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the
house. I felt worse and worse—at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down
in my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother , and suddenly threw myself at
her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for
my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an
unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most conscientious of
stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For several hours I lay there
broad awake, feeling a great deal worse  than I have ever done since, even from
the greate st subsequ ent misfortunes. At last I must have fallen into a troubled
nightmare of a doze; and slowly waki ng from it—half steeped in dreams— I
opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer
darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to
be seen, and nothing  was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in
mine. My arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable,
silent form  or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by
my bed-si de. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the
most awfu l fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I
could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be broken. I knew not
how this consciousness at last glided away from me; but waking in the morning ,
I shud deringly remembered it all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards
I lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery . Nay, to this very
hour, I often puzzle myself with it. Now , take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the supernatural
hand in mine were very similar , in their strangeness, to those which I
experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg’ s pagan arm thrown round me. But at length all the past night’ s events soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed
reality , and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament. For though I tried to
move his arm—unlo ck his bridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he still
hugged me tightly , as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove
to rouse him—“Qu eequeg!”—but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled
over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a sligh t
scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the
savage’ s side, as if it were a hatchet-fac ed baby . A pretty pickle, truly, thought I;
abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—in the name of goodness,  Queequeg, wake!” At length, by dint of
much wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations upon the
unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow  male in that matrimonial sort of style, I
succeeded in extracting a grunt; and presently , he drew back his arm, shook
himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water , and sat up in bed,
stiff as a pike-staf f, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not
altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim consciousness of
knowing something  about me seemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile, I
lay quietl y eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon
narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at last, his mind seemed made
up touching the character of his bedfellow , and he became, as it were, reconciled
to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor , and by certain signs and sounds gave
me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to
dress afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 29/353under the circumsta nces, this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these
savages have an innate sense of delicacy , say what you will; it is marvellous how
essentially polite they are. I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg,
because he treated me with so much civility and consideration, while I was
guilty of great rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette
motions; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don’t see every day, he and his ways
were well worth unusual regarding. He commenced dressing at top by donn ing his beaver hat, a very tall one, by
the by, and then—st ill minus his trowse rs—he hunted up his boots. What under
the heaven s he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next movement was to crush
himself—boots in hand, and hat on—under the bed; when, from sundry violen t
gaspings and straini ngs, I inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though
by no law of propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private
when putting on his boots. But Queeq ueg, do you see, was a creature in the
transition stage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly . He was just enough civilized
to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"His education
was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not been a smal l
degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at
all; but then, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of
getting under the bed to put them on. At last, he emer ged with his hat very much
dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began creaking and limping about
the room, as if, not being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled
cowhide ones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched and
tormented him at the first go of f of a bitter cold morning. Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window , and that the street
being very narrow , the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room,
and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg made,
staving about with little else but his hat and boots on; I begged him as well as I
could, to accelerat e his toilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his
pantaloons as soon as possible. He complied, and then proceeded to wash
himself. At that time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face;
but Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his
ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking
up a piece of hard soap on the wash-sta nd centre table, dipped it into water and
commenced latherin g his face. I was watching to see where he kept his razor ,
when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner , slips out the long
wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and striding up
to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rathe r
harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers’ s best cutlery
with a vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came
to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly
sharp the long straight edges are always kept. The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of the
room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his harpoon like
a marshal’ s baton. CHAPTER 5. Br eakfast.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 30/353I quickly followed suit, and descend ing into the bar-room accosted the
grinning landlord very pleasantly . I cherished no malice towards him, though he
had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow . However , a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a good
thing; the more’ s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper person, afford
stuff for a good joke to anybody , let him not be backward, but let him cheerfully
allow himself to spend and be spent in that way. And the man that has anything
bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is more in that man than you
perhaps think for . The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the
night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were nearly
all whale men; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and sea
carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship
keepers; a brown and brawny company , with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy
set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns. You could  pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This young
fellow’ s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would seem to smell
almost as musky; he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might say a touch of satin
wood is in him. In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but
slightly bleached withal; he doubtless has tarrie d whole weeks ashore. But who
could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints, seemed
like the Andes’  western slope, to show forth in one array , contrasting climates ,
zone by zone. “Grub, ho!” now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went to
breakfast. They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease in
manner , quite self-p ossessed in company . Not always, though: Ledyard, the
great New  England traveller , and Mung o Park, the Scotch one; of all men, they
possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But perhaps the mere crossing of
Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary
walk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of
poor Mungo’ s performances—this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best
mode of attaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, that sort of thing is
to be had anywhere. These reflections just here are occasion ed by the circumstance that after we
were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some good stories about
whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man maintained a profound
silence. And not only that, but they looked embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of
sea-dogs, many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great
whales on the high seas—entire strangers to them—and duelled them dead
without winking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast table—all of the
same calling, all of kindred tastes—look ing round as sheepishly at each other as
though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green
Mountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior whalemen! But as for Queequeg—why , Queequeg sat there among them—at the head of
the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I cannot say much
for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his
bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it there withou t
ceremony; reaching over the table with it, to the imminent jeopardy of many
heads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards him. But that was certainly very6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 31/353coolly done by him, and every one knows that in most people’ s estimation, to do
anything coolly is to do it genteelly . We will not speak of all Queequeg’ s peculiarities here; how he eschewed
coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks, done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public
room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there quietly digesting and
smoking with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll. CHAPTER 6.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Str eet. If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an
individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town ,
that astoni shment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the
streets of New Bedford. In thoroug hfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will frequently
offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts. Even in
Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle
the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays; and
at Bombay , in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often scared the natives. But
New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunt s
you see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at
street corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy
flesh. It makes a stranger stare. But, besid es the Feegeeans, Tongatobo oarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,
and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft which
unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still more curious,
certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town scores of green
Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the
fishery . They are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows who have felled
forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance. Many are as
green as the Green Mountains whence they came. In some things you would
think them but a few hours old.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
Look there!,"Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"that chap strutting round the corner . He wears a beaver hat and swallow-ta iled coat, girdled with a sailor -belt and
sheath-knife. Here comes another with a sou’-wester and a bombazine cloak. No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one—I mean a
downright bumpkin dandy—a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his two
acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a country
dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation, and
joins the great whale-fishery , you should see the comical things he does upon
reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his
waistcoats; straps to his canvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will
burst those straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons,
and all, down the throat of the tempest. But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and
bumpkins to show her visitors.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Not at all. Still New Bedford is a queer place . Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this day perhaps have
been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador . As it is, parts of her back
country are enough to frighten one, they look so bony . The town itself is perhap s6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 32/353the dearest place to live in, in all New England. It is a land of oil, true enough:
but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run with
milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of
this, nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and
gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"how planted
upon this once scraggy scoria of a country? Go and gaze upon  the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses and
flowery gardens came from the Atlantic,  Pacific, and Indian oceans. One and all,
they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea. Can Herr
Alexander perform a feat like that? In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their daughters,
and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece. You must go to New
Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil in
every house, and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles. In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples—long avenues
of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful and bountiful horse -
chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer -by their tapering upright cones of
congregated blossom s. So omnipotent is art; which in many a district of New
Bedford has superinduced bright terrace s of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks
thrown aside at creation’ s final day . And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But
roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is
perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that bloom of
theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young girls breathe such
musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore, as though they were
drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands. CHAPTER 7.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Chapel. In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman’ s Chapel, and few are the
moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who fail to
make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this special
errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin, I fought my
way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found a small scattered congregation
of sailors,  and sailors’  wives and widows. A muffled silence reigned, only
broken at times by the shrieks of the storm. Each silent worshipper seemed
purposely sitting apart from the other , as if each silent grief were insular and
incommunicable. The chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these silent islands
of men and women  sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black
borders, masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit. Three of them ran
something like the following, but I do not pretend to quote:—
SACRED TO THE MEMOR Y OF JOHN TALBOT , Who, at the age of
eighteen, was lost overboard, Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia,
November  1st, 1836. THIS TABLET  Is erected to his Memory BY  HIS SISTER.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

"Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated myself near
the door, and turning  sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me. Affected
by the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze of incredulou s
curiosity in his countenance. This savage was the only person present who
seemed to notice my entrance; because he was the only one who could not read,
and, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall. Whether
any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among
the congregation, I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the
fishery , and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not
the trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before me were
assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablet s
sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh. Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing among
flowers can say—he re, here lies my beloved; ye know not the desolation that
broods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles
which cover no ashes! What despair in those immovable inscriptions! Wha t
deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all
Faith, and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished
without a grave. As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as
here. In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included; why it is
that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no tales, though containing
more secre ts than the Goodwin Sands; how it is that to his name who yesterday
departed for the other world, we prefix so significant and infidel a word, and yet
do not thus entitle him, if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living
earth; why the Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals ;
in what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly , hopeless trance, yet lies antique
Adam who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we still refuse to be
comforted for those who we neverthele ss maintain are dwelling in unspeakable
bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore but the rumor of
a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city. All these things are not without
their meanings. But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead
doubts she gathers her most vital hope. It needs scarcely to be told, with what  feelings, on the eve of a Nantucket
voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky light of that darkened ,
doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me. Yes,
Ishmael, the same fate may be thine . But somehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion, it seems—aye, a
stove boat will make me an immortal  by brevet. Yes, there is death in this
business of whaling—a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into
Eternity . But what then?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life
and Death. Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true
substance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too much like6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

thinnest of air. Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being. In fact take
my body who will, take it I say, it is not me. And therefore three cheers for
Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they will, for stave my
soul, Jove himself cannot. CHAPTER 8.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Pulpit. I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness
entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon admitting him, a
quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation, sufficiently attested that
this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so
called by the whale men, among whom he was a very great favourite. He had
been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had
dedicated his life to the ministry . At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was
in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seem s
merging into a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his
wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom—the
spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February’ s snow . No one having
previously heard his history , could for the first time behold Father Mapple
without the utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical
peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not
come in his carriage , for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his
great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of
the water it had absorbed. However , hat and coat and overshoes were one by one
removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a
decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit. Like most old fashi oned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a regular
stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor , seriously contrac t
the already  small area of the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had acted upon the
hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a
perpendicular side ladder , like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whali ng captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of
red worste d man-ropes for this ladder , which, being itself nicely headed, and
stained with a mahogany colour , the whole contrivance, considering what
manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad taste. Halting for an instant
at the foot of the ladder , and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of
the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor -
like but still revere ntial dexterity , hand over hand, mounted the steps as if
ascending the main-top of his vessel. The perpendicular parts of this side ladder , as is usually the case with
swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood, so
that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the pulpit, it had not
escaped me that however convenient for a ship, these joints in the present
instance seemed unnecessary . For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after
gaining the height, slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately
drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him
impregnable in his little Quebec.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 35/353I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this. Father
Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation  for sincerity and sanctity , that I could
not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage. No,
thought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing; furthermore, it must
symbolize something unseen.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Can it be, then, that by that act of physical
isolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward
worldly ties and connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the
word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing
stronghold—a lofty  Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the
walls. But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place, borrowed
from the chaplain’ s former sea-farings. Between the marble cenotaphs on either
hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large
painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee
coast of black rocks and snowy breakers. But high above the flying scud and
dark-rolling clouds,  there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed
forth an angel’ s face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon
the ship’ s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into the
Victory’ s plank where Nelson fell. “Ah, noble ship,” the angel seemed to say,
“beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is
breaking through; the clouds are rolling of f—serenest azure is at hand.”
Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had
achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the likeness of a
ship’ s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work ,
fashioned after a ship’ s fiddle-headed beak. What could be more full of meaning? —for the pulpit is ever this earth’ s
foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the world. From
thence it is the storm  of God’ s quick wrath is first descried, and the bow must
bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first
invoked for favourab le winds. Yes, the world’ s a ship on its passage out, and not
a voyage complete; and the pulpit is its prow . CHAPTER 9.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Sermon. Father Mapple rose,  and in a mild voice  of unassuming authority ordered the
scattered people to condense. “Starboard gangway , there! side away to larboard
—larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!”
There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a still
slighter shuffling of women’ s shoes, and all was quiet again, and every eye on
the preacher . He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit’ s bows, folded his large brown
hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered a prayer so deeply
devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea. This ended , in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a bell in a
ship that is foundering at sea in a fog— in such tones he commenced reading the
following hymn; but changing his mann er towards the concluding stanzas, burst
forth with a pealing exultation and joy—6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 36/353     “The ribs and terrors in the whale,
     Arched over me a dismal gloom,
     While all God’ s sun-lit waves rolled by ,
     And lift me deepening down to doom. “I saw the opening maw of hell,
     With endless pains and sorrows there;
     Which none but they that feel can tell—
     Oh, I was plunging to despair . “In black distress, I called my God,
     When I could scarce believe him mine,
     He bowed his ear to my complaints—
     No more the whale did me confine. “W ith speed he flew to my relief,
     As on a radiant dolphin borne;
     Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone
     The face of my Deliverer God. “My song for ever shall record
     That terrible, that joyful hour;
     I give the glory to my God,
     His all the mercy and the power .”
 
Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the howling
of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of
the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the proper page, said:
“Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the first chapter of Jonah—‘And
God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.’”
“Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters—four yarns—is one of
the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what depths of the
soul does Jonah’ s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant lesson to us is this
prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish’s belly! How billow-like
and boisterously grand! We feel the floods surging over us; we sound with him
to the kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about
us! But what  is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-
stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of
the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the
sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment,
repentance, prayers,  and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all
sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience
of the command of God—never mind now what that command was, or how
conveyed—which he found a hard command. But all the things that God would
have us do are hard for us to do—remember that—and hence, he oftene r
commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we must disobey
ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying
God consists. “With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at God, by
seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into
countries where God does not reign, but only the Captains of this earth. He
skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that’s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By all account s6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

opinion of learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far
by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days,
when the Atlantic was an almost unknow n sea. Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa,
shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and
Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousa nd miles to the westward from that, just
outside the Straits of Gibraltar . See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to
flee world-wide from God? Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy
of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling
among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So disordered,
self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah,
on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a
deck. How plainly he’s a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-
bag,—no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after
much dodging search, he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her
cargo; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for
the mome nt desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger ’s evil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in vain
essays his wretched  smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he
can be no innocent. In their gamesome but still serious way, one whispers to the
other—“Jack, he’s robbed a widow;”  or, “Joe, do you mark him; he’s a
bigamist;” or, “Harry lad, I guess he’s the adulterer that broke jail in old
Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing  murderers from Sodom.” Another runs
to read the bill that’s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is
moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide ,
and containing a description of his perso n. He reads, and looks from Jonah to the
bill; while  all his sympathetic shipmate s now crowd round Jonah, prepared to
lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his
boldness to his face,  only looks so much the more a coward. He will not confess
himself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it;
and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him
pass, and he descends into the cabin. “‘Who’ s there?’  cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out his
papers for the Customs—‘Who’ s there?’  Oh! how that harmless question
mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again. But he rallies. ‘I
seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail ye, sir?’ Thus far the busy
Captain had not looked up to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but
no sooner does he hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance . ‘We sail with the next coming tide,’  at last he slowly answered, still intently
eyeing him. ‘No sooner , sir?’—‘Soon enough for any honest man that goes a
passenger .’ Ha! Jonah, that’s another stab. But he swiftly calls away the Captain
from that scent. ‘I’ll sail with ye,’—he says,—‘the passage money how much is
that?—I’ll pay now.’ For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing
not to be overlooked in this history , ‘that he paid the fare thereof ’ ere the craft
did sail. And taken with the context, this is full of meaning. “Now Jonah’s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime
in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In this world ,
shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely , and without a passport;
whereas Virtue, if a pauper , is stopped at all frontiers. So Jonah’ s Captain
prepares to test the length of Jonah’ s purse, ere he judge him openly . He charges
him thrice the usual sum; and it’s assented to. Then the Captain knows that
Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its
rear with gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still
molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit. Not a forger, any6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 38/353way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage. ‘Point out my state-
room, Sir,’ says Jonah now, ‘I’m travel- weary; I need sleep.’  ‘Thou lookest like
it,’ says the Captain, ‘there’ s thy room.’  Jonah enters, and would lock the door,
but the lock contain s no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain
laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of convicts ’
cells being never allowed to be locked  within. All dressed and dusty as he is,
Jonah throws himsel f into his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almos t
resting on his forehead. The air is close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that
contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship’ s water -line, Jonah feels the
heralding presentime nt of that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the
smallest of his bowels’  wards. “Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in
Jonah’ s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of
the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in slight motion, still
maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room; though, in truth ,
infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which
it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented
eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for
his restless  glance. But that contradiction  in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awry .","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"‘Oh! so my conscience hangs in
me!’ he groans, ‘straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my soul are
all in crookedness!’
“Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still reeling,
but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the Roman race-horse
but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as one who in that miserable
plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until
the fit be passed; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals
over him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and
there’ s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah’ s prodigy
of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep. “And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and from
the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening, glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers! the contraband was
Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm
comes on, the ship is like to break. But now when the boatswain calls all hand s
to lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the
wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with
trampling feet right over Jonah’ s head; in all this raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his
hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers ,
and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now
with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone
down into the sides of the ship—a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was
fast asleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead ear,
‘What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!’  Startled from his lethar gy by that direfu l
cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to
look out upon the sea. But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow
leaping over the bulwarks. Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding
no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning
while yet afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the
steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowspri t
pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the tormented
deep.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 39/353“Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his cringing
attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The sailors mark him;
more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last, fully to test the
truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to
see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah’ s; that
discovered, then how furiously they mob him with their questions. ‘What is
thine occu pation?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
Whence comest thou? Thy country?,"Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"What people? But mark
now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask him
who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer to those
questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put by them, but the
unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon
him. “‘I am a Hebrew ,’ he cries—and then—‘I fear the Lord the God of Heaven
who hath made the sea and the dry land!’  Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well mightes t
thou fear the Lord God then! Straightway , he now goes on to make a full
confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled, but still
are pitiful. For when  Jonah, not yet supplicating God for mercy , since he but too
well knew  the darkness of his deserts,— when wretched Jonah cries out to them
to take him and cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for his sake this
great temp est was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other
means to save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder; then,
with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly
lay hold of Jonah. “And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea; when
instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is still, as Jonah
carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water behind. He goes down in
the whirli ng heart of such a masterles s commotion that he scarce heeds the
moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the
whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish’s belly . But observe his prayer ,
and learn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for
direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves all his
deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and
pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true
and faithfu l repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventua l
deliverance of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah
before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model for
repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah.”
While he was speak ing these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting
storm without seem ed to add new power to the preacher , who, when describing
Jonah’ s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself. His deep chest heaved as
with a ground-swell ; his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work; and
the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow , and the light leaping
from his eye, made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was
strange to them. There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves of the
Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with closed eyes, for the
moment, seemed communing with God and himself. But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly , with
an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility , he spake these words:
“Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press upon
me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 40/353teaches to all sinners ; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I am a greater
sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come down from this mast-head
and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and listen as you listen, while some
one of you reads me that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to
me, as a pilot of the living God. How being  an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker
of true things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the
ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled
from his mission, and sought to escape  his duty and his God by taking ship at
Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we have seen, God
came upon him in the whale, and swallo wed him down to living gulfs of doom,
and with swift slant ings tore him along  ‘into the midst of the seas,’  where the
eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and ‘the weeds were
wrapped about his head,’  and all the watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet
even then beyond the reach of any plummet—‘out of the belly of hell’—when
the whale grounded upon the ocean’ s utmost bones, even then, God heard the
engulphed, repenting  prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the fish; and
from the shuddering cold and blackness  of the sea, the whale came breeching up
towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and earth; and
‘vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;’  when the word of the Lord came a
second time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten—his ears, like two sea-shells, still
multitudinously murmuring of the ocean—Jonah did the Almighty’ s bidding. And what was that, shipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it! “This, shipmates, this is that other lesso n; and woe to that pilot of the living
God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel duty! Woe
to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into a
gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal! Woe to him whose
good name  is more to him than goodnes s! Woe to him who, in this world, courts
not dishon or! Woe to him who would not be true, even though to be false were
salvation! Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to
others is himself a castaway!”
He dropped and fell away from himself  for a moment; then lifting his face to
them again, showed  a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with a heavenly
enthusiasm,—“But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of every woe, there is a
sure delight; and higher the top of that delight, than the bottom of the woe is
deep. Is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low? Delight is to him—a
far, far upward, and inward delight—who against the proud gods and
commodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to
him whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous
world has gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the
truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the
robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,—top-gallant delight is to him, who
acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to
heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the
boisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages. And eterna l
delight and deliciousness will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with
his final breath—O Father!—chiefly known to me by Thy rod—mortal or
immortal, here I die. I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world’ s, or
mine own. Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man that he
should live out the lifetime of his God?”
He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with his
hands, and so remain ed kneeling, till all the people had departed, and he was left
alone in the place.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 41/353CHAPTER 10. A Bosom Friend. Returning to the Spouter -Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there quite
alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time. He was
sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, and in one
hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his; peering hard
into its face, and with a jack-knife gentl y whittling away at its nose, meanwhile
humming to himself in his heathenish way . But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going to the
table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap began counting the
pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page—as I fancied—stopping a
moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn
gurgling whistle of astonishment. He would then begin again at the next fifty;
seeming to commence at number one each time, as though he could not coun t
more than fifty, and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found
together , that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited. With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and hideously
marred about the face—at least to my taste—his countenance yet had a
something in it which was by no means  disagreeable. You cannot hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple
honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed
tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils. And besides all this, there
was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could
not altoget her maim . He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had
had a creditor . Whet her it was, too, that his head being shaved, his forehead was
drawn out in freer  and brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it
otherwise would, this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was
phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of
General Washington’ s head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had the same
long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were
likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on top. Queequeg was Geor ge Washington cannibalistically developed. Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be
looking out at the storm from the casem ent, he never heeded my presence, never
troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but appeared wholly occupied
with counting the pages of the marvello us book. Considering how sociably we
had been sleeping together the night previous, and especially considering the
affectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I
thought this indifference of his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at
times you do not know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing ;
their calm  self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had
noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the
other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have no
desire to enlar ge the circle of his acqu aintances.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"All this struck me as mighty
singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape
Horn, that is—which was the only way he could get there—thrown among
people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 42/353seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity; content with his own
companionship; always equal to himself. Surely this was a touch of fine
philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"But, perhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so
living or so striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out
for a philo sopher , I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he must have
“broken his digester .”
As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that mild stage
when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then only glows to be looked
at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements, and peering
in upon us silent, solitary twain; the storm booming without in solemn swells; I
began to be sensible of strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my
splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This
soothing savage had redeemed it. There  he sat, his very indifference speaking a
nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits. Wild he
was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn
towards him. And those same things that would have repelled most others, they
were the very magnets that thus drew me. I’ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since
Christian kindness has proved but hollo w courtesy . I drew my bench near him,
and made  some friendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him
meanwhile. At first he little noticed these advances; but presently , upon my
referring to his last night’ s hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were
again to be bedfello ws. I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased,
perhaps a little complimented. We then turned over the book together , and I endeavored to explain to him the
purpose of the printi ng, and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it. Thus
I soon engaged his interest; and from that we went to jabbering the best we
could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town. Soon I
proposed a social smoke; and, producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly
offered me a puff. And then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his,
and keeping it regularly passing between us. If there yet lurked any ice of indifferen ce towards me in the Pagan’ s breast,
this pleasa nt, genial  smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and left us cronies. He
seemed to take to me quite as naturally  and unbiddenly as I to him; and when
our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against mine, clasped me round the
waist, and said that henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country’ s
phrase, that we were  bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should
be. In a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too
premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage those old
rules would not apply . After supper , and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room
together . He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his enormous
tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some thirty dollars in
silver; then spreading them on the table, and mechanically dividing them into
two equal portions, pushed one of them towards me, and said it was mine. I was
going to remonstrat e; but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers ’
pockets. I let them stay. He then went about his evening prayers, took out his
idol, and removed the paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought
he seemed  anxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow , I
deliberated a moment whether , in case he invited me, I would comply or
otherwise. I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
Presbyterian Churc h. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth—pagans and all
included—can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood? Impossible!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"But what is worship?—to do the will of God— that is worship. And
what is the will of God?—to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow

my particular Presbyterian form of worship. Consequently , I must then unite
with him in his; ergo, I must turn idolator . So I kindled the shavings; helped prop
up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed
before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and
went to bed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world. But we did
not go to sleep without some little chat. How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential
disclosures between  friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the very bottom
of their souls to each other; and some old couples often lie and chat over old
times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our hearts’  honeymoon, lay I and
Queequeg—a cosy , loving pair . CHAPTER 1 1.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Nightgown. We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and
Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over
mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free and easy were
we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what little nappishness
remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like getting up again, though
day-break was yet some way down the future. Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position began
to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up; the
clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the head-board with our four
knees drawn up close together , and our two noses bending over them, as if our
kneepans were warming-pans. We felt very nice and snug, the more so since it
was so chilly out of doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was
no fire in the room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth,
some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world that is
not what it is merely  by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If you flatter yoursel f
that you are all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot
be said to be comfortable any more. But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the
tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed,
in the general consc iousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which
is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height of this sort of
deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness
and the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the
heart of an arctic crystal. We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at once
I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether by day or by
night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always keeping my eyes
shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed. Because no6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences, though light be more
congenial to our clayey part. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my
own pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom
of the unilluminated twelve-o’clock-a t-night, I experienced a disagreeable
revulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were
best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a
strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be it said, that
though I had felt such a strong repugna nce to his smoking in the bed the night
before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to
bend them. For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by
me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then. I no more  felt unduly concerned for the landlord’ s policy of insurance. I was
only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a
blanket with a real friend. With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders ,
we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other , till slowly there grew over
us a blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp. Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant
scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island; and, eager to hear his
history , I begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly complied. Though at the
time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words, yet subsequent disclosures,
when I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology , now enable me
to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give. CHAPTER 12.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Biographical. Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and
South. It is not down in any map; true places never are. When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a
grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green sapling; even
then, in Queequeg’ s ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire to see something
more of Christendo m than a specimen whaler or two. His father was a High
Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts
who were the wives  of unconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his
veins—royal stuff; though sadly vitiate d, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he
nourished in his untutored youth. A Sag Harbor ship visited his father ’s bay, and Queequeg sought a passage to
Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of seamen, spurned his
suit; and not all the King his father ’s influence could prevail. But Queequeg
vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled off to a distant strait, which he
knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island. On one side was a
coral reef; on the other a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thicket s
that grew out into the water . Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets ,
with its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and when
the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her side; with one
backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains;
and throw ing himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and
swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and Queequeg budged
not. Struck by his desperate dauntle ssness, and his wild desire to visit
Christendom, the captain at last relented , and told him he might make himself at
home. But this fine young savage—this sea Prince of Wales, never saw the
Captain’ s cabin. They put him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of
him. But like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities ,
Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy , if thereby he might happily gain the
power of enlightening his untutored countrymen. For at bottom—so he told me
—he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the arts
whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more than that, still
better than they were.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him
that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely more so,
than all his father ’s heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what
the sailors did there;  and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they spent
their wages in that place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for lost. Thought he, it’s
a wicked world in all meridians; I’ll die a pagan. And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians, wore
their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer ways about him,
though now some time from home. By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having a
coronation; since he might now consider  his father dead and gone, he being very
old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not yet; and added that he
was fearful Christianity , or rather Christ ians, had unfitted him for ascending the
pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings before him. But by and by, he
said, he would retur n,—as soon as he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce,
however , he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a
sceptre now . I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future
movements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon this, I
told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my intention to
sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port for an adventurou s
whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to accompany me to that island,
ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same
mess with me, in short to share my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly
dip into the Potluck of both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for beside s
the affection I now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer , and as
such, could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly
ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as
known to merchant seamen. His story being ended with his pipe’ s last dying puff, Queequeg embraced me,
pressed his forehea d against mine, and blowing out the light, we rolled over
from each other , this way and that, and very soon were sleeping. CHAPTER 13.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Wheelbarr ow. Next morn ing, Mon day, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber , for
a block, I settled my own and comrade’ s bill; using, however , my comrade’ s6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 46/353money . The grinning  landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed amazingly tickled
at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg—
especially as Peter Coffin’s cock and bull stories about him had previously so
much alarmed me concerning the very person whom I now companied with. We borrowed a wheelbarrow , and embarking our things, including my own
poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg’ s canv as sack and hammock, away we went
down to “the Moss,” the little Nantucke t packet schooner moored at the wharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so much—for they
were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets,—but at seeing him and
me upon such confidential terms. But we heeded them not, going along
wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust
the sheath  on his harpoon barbs. I asked him why he carried such a troublesome
thing with him ashore, and whether all whaling ships did not find their own
harpoons. To this, in substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true
enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of
assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate with the
hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the
farmers’  meadows armed with their own scythes—though in no wise obliged to
furnish them—even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his
own harpoon. Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about the
first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor . The owners of his
ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his heavy chest to his
boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the thing—though in truth he was
entirely so, concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow—
Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it fast; and then shoulders the barrow
and marches up the wharf. “Why ,” said I, “Queequeg, you might have known
better than that, one would think.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Didn’ t the people laugh?”
Upon this, he told me another story . The people of his island of Rokovoko, it
seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanut s
into a large stained calabash like a punch bowl; and this punchbowl always form s
the great central ornament on the braid ed mat where the feast is held. Now a
certain grand merchant ship once touch ed at Rokovoko, and its commander—
from all accounts, a very stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain
—this commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg’ s sister , a
pretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding guests were
assembled at the bride’ s bamboo cotta ge, this Captain marches in, and being
assigned the post of honor , placed himself over against the punchbowl, and
between the High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg’ s father . Grace
being said,—for those people have their grace as well as we—though Queequeg
told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to our platters, they,
on the contrary , copying the ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all
feasts—Grace, I say, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the
immemorial ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and
consecrating fingers  into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates. Seeing
himself placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony , and thinking himself—
being Captain of a ship—as having plain precedence over a mere island King,
especially in the King’s own house—the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his
hands in the punchbowl;—taking it I suppose for a huge finger -glass. “Now ,”
said Queequeg, “what you tink now?—Didn’ t our people laugh?”
At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner .","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushn et river. On one side, New Bedford rose
in terraces  of streets, their ice-covered trees all glittering in the clear , cold air.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 47/353Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and
side by side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at
last; while  from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended
noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises were
on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a
second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly ef fort. Gaining the more open water , the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little Moss
tossed the quick foam from her bows,  as a young colt his snortings. How I
snuffed that Tartar air!—how I spurned that turnpike earth!—that common
highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs; and turned
me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records. At the same foam-fo untain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me. His
dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth. On, on we
flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast; ducked and dived
her bows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways leaning, we sideways darted ;
every ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes
in land tornadoes. So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the
plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of
the passengers, a lubber-like assembly , who marvelled that two fellow being s
should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything more
dignified than a whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins
there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre
of all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him
behind his back. I thought the bumpkin’ s hour of doom was come. Dropping his
harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost
miraculous dexterity  and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air; then
slightly tapping his stern in mid-somers et, the fellow landed with bursting lungs
upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk
pipe and passed it to me for a puf f. “Capting! Capting!” yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;
“Capting, Capting, here’ s the devil.”
“Hallo, you sir,” cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking up to
Queequeg, “what in thunder do you mean by that? Don’ t you know you migh t
have killed that chap?”
“What him say?” said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me. “He say,” said I, “that you came near kill-e that man there,” pointing to the
still shivering greenhorn. “Kill-e,” cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly
expression of disdain, “ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e so
small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!”
“Look you,” roared the Captain, “I’ll kill-e you, you cannibal, if you try any
more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.”
But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to mind his
own eye. The prodig ious strain upon the main-sail had parted the weather -sheet ,
and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side, completely
sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor fellow whom Queequeg had
handled so roughly , was swept overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to
attempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness. It flew from right to
left, and back again,  almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed
on the point of snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed
capable of being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 48/353the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of this
consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the
path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks, and
then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as it swept over his
head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The
schooner was run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the
stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long
living arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog,
throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his
brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand and gloriou s
fellow , but saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone down. Shooting
himself perpendicularly from the water , Queequeg, now took an instant’ s glance
around him, and seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and
disappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out,
and with the other dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The
poor bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the
captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle;
yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive. Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he at all
deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only asked
for water—fresh water—something to wipe the brine off; that done, he put on
dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning  against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing
those around him, seemed to be saying to himself—“It’ s a mutual, joint-stock
world, in all meridians. We cannibals must help these Christians.”
CHAPTER 14. Nantucket. Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a fine
run, we safely arrived in Nantucket. Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of the
world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely than the
Eddystone lighthous e. Look at it—a mere hillock, and elbow of sand; all beach,
without a background. There is more sand there than you would use in twenty
years as a substitute for blotting paper . Some gamesome wights will tell you that
they have  to plant weeds there, they don’t grow naturally; that they impor t
Canada thistles; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in
an oil cask; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the
true cross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses, to get
under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an oasis, three
blades in a day’s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like
Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up, belted about, every way
inclosed, surrounded , and made an utter island of by the ocean, that to their very
chairs and tables small clams will some times be found adhering, as to the backs
of sea turtles. But these extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois. Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by
the red-men.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle swooped down upon
the New England coast, and carried off an infant Indian in his talons. With loud
lament the parents saw their child borne  out of sight over the wide waters.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"They

https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 49/353perilous passage they discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory
casket,—the poor little Indian’ s skeleton. What wonder , then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take to
the sea for a livelihood! They first caug ht crabs and quohogs in the sand; grown
bolder , they waded out with nets for mackerel; more experienced, they pushed
off in boats and captured cod; and at last, launching a navy of great ships on the
sea, explo red this watery world; put an incessant belt of circumnavigations
round it; peeped in at Behring’ s Straits; and in all seasons and all ocean s
declared everlasting war with the might iest animated mass that has survived the
flood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea
Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power , that his very
panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults! And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from their
ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like so many
Alexanders; parcelli ng out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans,
as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add Mexico to Texas, and
pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English  overswarm all India, and hang out their
blazing banner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the
Nantucketer ’s. For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other
seamen having but a right of way throu gh it. Merchant ships are but extension
bridges; armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though
following the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships, other
fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living from
the bottom less deep  itself. The Nantuc keter , he alone resides and riots on the
sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro ploughing it
as his own special plantation. There is his home; there lies his business, which a
Noah’ s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in
China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the
waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows
not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world,
more stran gely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull,
that at sunset folds  her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at
nightfall, the Nantucketer , out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his
rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales. CHAPTER 15. Chowder . It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor ,
and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at
least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter -Inn had
recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted
to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover
he had assured us that Cousin Hosea,  as he called him, was famous for his
chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than
try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a
yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the
larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three
points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the
place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 50/353especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—ou r
first point of depar ture—must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had
understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However , by dint of
beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable
inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no
mistaking.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses’  ears,
swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old
doorway . The horns  of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that
this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive
to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a
vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two
remaining horns; yes, two of them,  one for Queequeg, and one for me. It’s
ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port;
tombstones staring at me in the whalemen’ s chapel; and here a gallows! and a
pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints
touching Tophet? I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with
yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull red
lamp swin ging there , that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a
brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt. “Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I’ll be combing ye!”
“Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There’ s Mrs. Hussey .”
And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known our
desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey , postponing further scolding for the
present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with the
relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or
Cod?”
“What’ s that about Cods, ma’am?” said I, with much politeness. “Clam or Cod?” she repeated. “A clam for supper? a cold clam; is that what  you mean, Mrs. Hussey?” says
I, “but that’s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time, ain’t it, Mrs. Hussey?”
But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt, who
was waitin g for it in the entry , and seeming to hear nothing but the word “clam,”
Mrs. Huss ey hurried  towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling
out “clam for two,” disappeared. “Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us both
on one clam?”
However , a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the
apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder came
in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"hearken to me. It
was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with
pounded ship biscui t, and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched
with butter , and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being
sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular , Queequeg seeing his favourite
fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we
despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and
bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey’ s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would
try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word “cod”
with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 51/353came forth again, but with a different  flavor , and in good time a fine cod-
chowder was placed before us. We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to
myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What’ s that
stultifying saying about chowder -headed people? “But look, Queequeg, ain’t
that a live eel in your bowl? Where’ s your harpoon?”
Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its name; for
the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and
chowder for dinner , and chowder for supper , till you began to look for fish-
bones coming throu gh your clothes. The area before the house was paved with
clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and
Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin. There
was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one
morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen’ s
boats, I saw Hosea’ s brindled cow feedin g on fish remnants, and marching along
the sand with each foot in a cod’s decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I
assure ye. Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey
concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede me
up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she
allowed no harpoon  in her chambers. “Why not?” said I; “every true whaleman
sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because it’s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort’nt v’y’ge of his, when he was
gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of ile, was found dead in my
first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarder s
to take sich dangero us weepons in their rooms at night.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"So, Mr. Queequeg” (for
she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you till
morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?”
“Both,” says I; “and let’ s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety .”
CHAPTER 16. The Ship.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow . But to my surprise and no
small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been
diligently consulting  Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told
him two or three times over, and strongl y insisted upon it everyway , that instead
of our going togethe r among the whaling -fleet in harbor , and in concert selecting
our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the
ship shoul d rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us;
and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself,
I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned
out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present
irrespective of Queequeg. I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great
confidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and surprising forecast of
things; and cherishe d Yojo with consid erable esteem, as a rather good sort of
god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not
succeed in his benevolent designs.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 52/353Now , this plan of Queequeg’ s, or rather Yojo’s, touching the selection of our
craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg’ s
sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely . But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged
to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a
determined rushing sort of energy and vigor , that should quickly settle that
trifling little affair. Next morning early , leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in
our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or
day of fasting, humi liation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; how it
was I never could find out, for, though  I applied myself to it several times, I
never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then,
fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of
shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and
many random inqui ries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years ’
voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. Devil-Dam , I do not
know the origin of; Tit-bit  is obvious; Pequod , you will no doubt remember , was
the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the
ancient Medes. I peered and pryed abou t the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over
to the Tit-bit; and finally , going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a
moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us. You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;—
square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter -box galliots, and what
not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare
old Pequo d. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an
old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather -stained in
the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull’s complexion was
darkened like a French grenadier ’s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of
Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts stood
stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks
were worn  and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury
Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added
new and marvellous features, pertaining  to the wild business that for more than
half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate ,
before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and
one of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term of
his chief-m ateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all
over, with a quaint ness both of material and device, unmatched by anything
except it be Thorkill-Hake’ s carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like
any barbar ic Ethiopi an emperor , his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory . She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the
chased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were
garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale,
inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those
thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over
sheaves of sea-ivory . Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she
sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the
long narro w lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that
tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by
clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"All noble
things are touched with that. Now when  I looked about the quarter -deck, for some one having authority , in
order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody; but
I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 53/353behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was
of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of
limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the
right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs
laced together , mutually sloped towards  each other , and at the apex united in a
tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on
some old Pottowottamie Sachem’ s head . A triangular opening faced towards the
bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward. And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his
aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship’ s work
suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was
seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair , wriggling all over with curious carving;
and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic
stuff of which the wigwam was constructed. There was nothing so very particular , perhaps, about the appearance of the
elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny , like most old seamen, and heavily
rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine and
almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes,
which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and
always looking to windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to
become pursed together . Such eye-wrinkles are very ef fectual in a scowl. “Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of the tent. “Supposing it be the captain of the Pequ od, what dost thou want of him?” he
demanded. “I was thinking of shipping.”
“Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a stove
boat?”
“No, Sir , I never have.”
“Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh? “Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I’ve been several
voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”
“Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?—
I’ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service
to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel considerable proud
of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee
want to go a whaling, eh?—it looks a little suspicious, don’t it, eh?—Hast not
been a pirate, hast thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not
think of murdering the of ficers when thou gettest to sea?”
I protested  my innocence of these thing s. I saw that under the mask of these
half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish
Nantucketer , was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens,
unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard. “But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of
shipping ye.”
“Well, sir , I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”
“Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”
“Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”
“Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”
“I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 54/353“Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that’ s who ye are speaking to, young
man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the
voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew . We are part owners and
agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as
thou telles t ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself
to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find
that he has only one leg.”
“What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”
“Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed
up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!—ah, ah!”
I was a little alarme d by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the hearty
grief in his conclud ing exclamation, but said as calmly as I could, “What you
say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was any peculiar
ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred as much
from the simple fact of the accident.”
“Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d’ye see; thou dost not
talk shark a bit. Sure, ye’ve been to sea before now; sure of that?”
“Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the
merchant—”
“Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service—don’ t
aggravate me—I won’ t have it. But let us understand each other . I have given
thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?”
“I do, sir .”
“Very good. Now , art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale’ s
throat, and then jump after it? Answer , quick!”
“I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got rid of,
that is; which I don’ t take to be the fact.”
“Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by
experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world? Was not that what ye said?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"I thought so. Well then, just step forward there, and
take a peep over the weather -bow , and then back to me and tell me what ye see
there.”
For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing
exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all
his crow’ s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand. Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship
swinging to her anchor with the flood-ti de, was now obliquely pointing towards
the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and
forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see. “Well, what’ s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye see?”
“Not much ,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and
there’ s a squall coming up, I think.”
“Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round
Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can’ t ye see the world where you stand?”
I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod
was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now repeated to
Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me. “And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come along
with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 55/353Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and
surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain
Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is
sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants;
widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning about the value
of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in
Nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do
yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest. Now , Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker ,
the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its
inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the
Quaker , only variously and anomalously  modified by things altogether alien and
heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all
sailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a
vengeance. So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture
names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in childhood naturally
imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the
audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely
blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character ,
not unwor thy a Scandinavian sea-king,  or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when
these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular
brain and a pondero us heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many
long night-watches in the remotest wate rs, and beneath constellations never seen
here at the north, been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving
all nature’s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and
confiding breast, and thereby chiefly , but with some help from accidenta l
advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes one in
a whole nation’ s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies . Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or
other circumstances , he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at
the bottom  of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a
certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is
but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite
another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar , it only results again from
another phase of the Quaker , modified by individual circumstances. Like Capt ain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But
unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called serious things ,
and indee d deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all trifles—
Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictes t
sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of
many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved
this native  born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of
his vest. Still, for all this immutablen ess, was there some lack of common
consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from conscientious
scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded
the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he
in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in
the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things
in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much,
and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion
that a man’ s religio n is one thing, and this practical world quite another . This
world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes of the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

becoming boat-header , chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad,
as I hinted  before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from
active life at the goodly age of sixty , and dedicating his remaining days to the
quiet receiving of his well-earned income. Now , Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old
hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter , hard task-master . They told me in
Nantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story , that when he sailed the old
Categut whaleman, his crew , upon arriv ing home, were mostly all carried ashore
to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a
Quaker , he was certainly rather hard-he arted, to say the least. He never used to
swear , though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quantity
of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a chief-mate, to
have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely
nervous, till you could clutch something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go
to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence and
idleness perished before him.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"His own person was the exact embodiment of his
utilitarian character . On his long, gaunt body , he carried no spare flesh, no
superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap
of his broad-brimmed hat. Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed
Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and
there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this
to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly
crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he
seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume. “Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying
those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain knowledge. How far
ye got, Bildad?”
As if long habituated to such profane  talk from his old shipmate, Bildad,
without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me,
glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg. “He says he’ s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”
“Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me. “I dost,” said I unconsciously , he was so intense a Quaker . “What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg. “He’ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his
book in a mumbling tone quite audible. I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his
friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer . But I said nothing, only
looking round me sharply . Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the
ship’ s articles, placed pen and ink before  him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be
willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling
business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received
certain shares of the profits called lays, and that these lays were proportioned to
the degre e of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship’ s
company . I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay
would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a
ship, splic e a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I
should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net
proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And though6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 57/353the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay, yet it was better than nothing;
and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would
wear out on it, not to speak of my three years’  beef and board, for which I would
not have to pay one stiver . It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune
—and so it was, a very poor way indee d. But I am one of those that never take
on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board
and lodge  me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but
would not have been  surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of
a broad-shouldered make. But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a
generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both
Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the
principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable
and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship’ s affairs to
these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a
mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board
the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his
own firesi de. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-
knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an
interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on
mumbling to himself out of his book, “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
earth, where moth—”
“Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d’ye say, what lay shall we
give this young man?”
“Thou knowest best,” was the sepulc hral reply , “the seven hundred and
seventy-seventh wouldn’ t be too much, would it?—‘where moth and rust do
corrupt, but lay—’”
Lay, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-
seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not lay up
many lays here below , where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly
long lay that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at
first deceive a lands man, yet the slightest consideration will show that though
seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number , yet, when you come
to make a teenth  of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and
seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and
seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time. “Why , blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to swindle
this young man! he must have more than that.”
“Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting his
eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there will your
heart be also.”
“I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do ye hear
that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay , I say .”
Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, “Captain
Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest to
the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans, many of them—and that if
we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the
bread from those widows and those orphans. The seven hundred and seventy -
seventh lay , Captain Peleg.”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 58/353“Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin. “Blast
ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore
now had a conscien ce to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the
largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.”
“Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily , “thy conscience may be drawing ten
inches of water , or ten fathoms, I can’t tell; but as thou art still an impenitent
man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and
will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”
“Fiery pit! fiery pit!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult me. It’s an all-fired outrage to tell any huma n creature that he’s bound to hell. Fluke s
and flames ! Bildad, say that again to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I’ll—I’ll—
yes, I’ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye
canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”
As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous
oblique, sliding celerity , Bildad for that time eluded him. Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible
owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a
vessel so questionab ly owned and tempo rarily commanded, I stepped aside from
the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to
vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat
down again on the transom very quietly , and seemed to have not the slightes t
intention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his
ways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left
in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still
nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whis tled at last—“the squall’ s gone off to
leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that
pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That’ s he; thank ye,
Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael’ s thy name, didn’ t ye say? Well then,
down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay .”
“Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship too—shall
I bring him down to-morrow?”
“To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we’ll look at him.”
“What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in
which he had again been burying himself. “Oh! neve r thee mind about that, Bildad ,” said Peleg. “Has he ever whaled it
any?” turning to me. “Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”
“Well, bring him along then.”
And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had done
a good morning’ s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had
provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape. But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain with
whom I was to sail yet remained unseen  by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a
whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere
the captain  makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes
these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly
brief, that if the captain have a family , or any absorbing concernment of that
sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to
the owners till all is ready for sea. However , it is always as well to have a look at
him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I
accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 59/353“And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It’s all right enough; thou art
shipped.”
“Yes, but I should like to see him.”
“But I don’t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don’t know exactly what’ s
the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet
he don’t look so. In fact, he ain’t sick; but no, he isn’t well either . Any how,
young man, he won’t always see me, so I don’t suppose he will thee. He’s a
queer man, Captain Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou’lt like him
well enou gh; no fear, no fear. He’s a grand, ungodly , god-like man, Captain
Ahab; doesn’t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen . Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab’ s above the common; Ahab’ s been in colleges, as
well as ’mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed
his fiery lance in mightier , stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest
and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain’t Captain Bildad; no, and he
ain’t Captain Peleg; he’s Ahab, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowes t, was a
crowned king!”
“And a very vile one. When that wicked  king was slain, the dogs, did they not
lick his blood?”
“Come hither to me—hither , hither ,” said Peleg, with a significance in his eye
that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself. ’Twas a foolish,
ignorant whim of his crazy , widowed mother , who died when he was only a
twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw  Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name
would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee
the same. I wish to warn thee. It’s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I’ve sailed
with him as mate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good
man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there’ s a
good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I
know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it
was the sharp shoot ing pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as
any one might see. I know , too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that
accursed whale, he’s been a kind of moody—desperate moody , and savage
sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure
thee, young man, it’s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing
bad one. So good- bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he
happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three
voyages wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that
old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!”
As I walked away , I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been incidentally
revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain wild vagueness of
painfulness concerning him. And somehow , at the time, I felt a sympathy and a
sorrow for him, but for I don’t know what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at
all describe, was not exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it
did not disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed like
mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then. However , my
thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so that for the present dark
Ahab slipped my mind.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I cherish the greatest
respect towards everybody’ s religious obligations, never mind how comical, and
could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants
worshipping a toad-stool; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth,
who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets, bow
down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the
inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name. I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these things,
and not fancy oursel ves so vastly superio r to other mortals, pagans and what not,
because of their half-crazy conceits on these subjects. There was Queequeg,
now, certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and his
Ramadan;—but what of that? Queequeg  thought he knew what he was about, I
suppose; he seemed to be content; and there let him rest. All our arguing with
him would not avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all—
Presbyterians and Pagans alike—for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked
about the head, and sadly need mending. Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals
must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door; but no answer . I
tried to open it, but it was fastened inside. “Queequeg,” said I softly through the
key-hole:—all silent. “I say, Queequeg! why don’t you speak? It’s I—Ishmael.”
But all remained still as before. I began to grow alarmed.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

abundant time; I thought he might have  had an apoplectic fit. I looked through
the key-ho le; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the key-hole
prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see part of the foot-
board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more. I was surprised to
behold resting against the wall the wood en shaft of Queequeg’ s harpoon, which
the landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting to
the chamber . That’ s strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands
yonder , and he seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be
inside here, and no possible mistake. “Queequeg!—Queequeg!”—all still.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Something must have happened. Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted. Running
down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I met—the
chamber -maid. “La! la!” she cried, “I thought something must be the matter . I
went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was locked; and not a mouse
to be heard; and it’s been just so silent ever since. But I thought, may be, you
had both gone off and locked your bagg age in for safe keeping. La!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"la, ma’am ! —Mistress! murder! Mrs. Hussey! apoplexy!”—and with these cries, she ran
towards the kitchen, I following. Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a vinegar -
cruet in the other , having just broken away from the occupation of attending to
the castors, and scolding her little black boy meantime. “Wood-house!” cried I, “which way to it? Run for God’ s sake, and fetch
something to pry open the door—the axe!—the axe! he’s had a stroke; depend
upon it!”—and so saying I was unmeth odically rushing up stairs again empty -
handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot and vinegar -cruet, and
the entire castor of her countenance. “What’ s the matter with you, young man?”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 61/353“Get the axe! For God’ s sake, run for the doctor , some one, while I pry it
open!”
“Look here,” said the landlady , quickly putting down the vinegar -cruet, so as
to have one hand free; “look here; are you talking about prying open any of my
doors?”—and with that she seized my arm. “What’ s the matter with you? What’ s
the matter with you, shipmate?”
In as calm , but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand the whole
case. Unconsciously  clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of her nose, she
ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed—“No! I haven’ t seen it since I put it
there.” Running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs, she glanced in,
and return ing, told me that Queequeg ’s harpoon was missing. “He’ s killed
himself,” she cried. “It’s unfort’nate Stiggs done over again—there goes another
counterpane—God pity his poor mother !—it will be the ruin of my house. Has
the poor lad a sister ? Where’ s that girl?—there, Betty , go to Snarles the Painter ,
and tell him to paint me a sign, with—“no suicides permitted here, and no
smoking in the parlor;”—might as well kill both birds at once. Kill? The Lord be
merciful to his ghost! What’ s that noise there? You, young man, avast there!”
And runni ng up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force open
the door . “I don’t allow it; I won’ t have my premises spoiled. Go for the locksmith,
there’ s one about a mile from here. But avast!” putting her hand in her side-
pocket, “here’ s a key that’ll fit, I guess; let’s see.” And with that, she turned it in
the lock; but, alas! Queequeg’ s supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within. “Have to burst it open,” said I, and was running down the entry a little, for a
good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing I should not break
down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily rush dashed
myself full against the mark. With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming against
the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good heavens! there sat
Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right in the middle of the room;
squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on top of his head. He looked neithe r
one way nor the other way, but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of
active life. “Queequeg,” said I, going up to him, “Queequeg, what’ s the matter with
you?”
“He hain’ t been a sittin’  so all day , has he?” said the landlady . But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt like
pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost intolerable, it
seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained; especially , as in all probability
he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too without his
regular meals. “Mrs. Hussey ,” said I, “he’s alive  at all events; so leave us, if you please, and I
will see to this strange af fair myself.”
Closing the door upon the landlady , I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg to
take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could do—for all my polite arts
and blandishments—he would not move a peg, nor say a single word, nor even
look at me, nor notice my presence in the slightest way . I wonder , thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do they fast
on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so; yes, it’s part of his
creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he’ll get up sooner or later, no doubt. It6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 62/353can’t last for ever, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I
don’t believe it’ s very punctual then. I went down to supper . After sitting a long time listening to the long stories of
some sailo rs who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as they called it
(that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig, confined to the north of
the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after listening to these plum-puddingers till
nearly eleven o’clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this
time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But
no; there he was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began to
grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting
there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of
wood on his head. “For heav en’s sake,  Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have
some supp er. You’ll  starve; you’ll kill yourself, Queequeg.” But not a word did
he reply . Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep; and no
doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to turning in, I
took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as it promised to be a very
cold night ; and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on. For some time,
do all I would, I could not get into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle;
and the mere thought of Queequeg—not four feet off—sitting there in that
uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his
hams in this dreary , unaccountable Ramadan! But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of day;
when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he had been
screwed down to the floor . But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the
window , up he got, with stiff and grating  joints, but with a cheerful look; limped
towards me where I lay; pressed his forehead again against mine; and said his
Ramadan was over . Now , as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person’ s religion, be it
what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person ,
because that other person don’t believe it also. But when a man’ s religion
becomes really frant ic; when it is a positive torment to him; and, in fine, makes
this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high time to
take that individual aside and ar gue the point with him. And just so I now did with Queequeg. “Queequeg,” said I, “get into bed now,
and lie and listen to me.” I then went on, beginning with the rise and progress of
the primitive religions, and coming down to the various religions of the present
time, during which time I labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents,
Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark
nonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the
obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense. I told him, too, that he being in
other thing s such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very
badly pained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous
Ramadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the
spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy
notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg, said I, rathe r
digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling; and
since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 63/353I then asked Queequeg whether he hims elf was ever troubled with dyspepsia;
expressing the idea very plainly , so that he could take it in. He said no; only
upon one memorable occasion.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"It was after a great feast given by his father the
king, on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed
by about two o’clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very
evening. “No more , Queequ eg,” said I, shudde ring; “that will do;” for I knew the
inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who had visited
that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when a great battle had
been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor;
and then, one by one, they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished
round like a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their
mouths, were sent round with the victor ’s compliments to all his friends, just as
though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys. After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression
upon Quee queg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed dull of hearing
on that important subject, unless consid ered from his own point of view; and, in
the second  place, he did not more than one third understand me, couch my ideas
simply as I would; and, finally , he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more
about the true religio n than I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending
concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible
young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety . At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty
breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not make much
profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the Pequod, sauntering
along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones. CHAPTER 18. His Mark. As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg
carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his
wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and furthermore
announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft, unless they previously
produced their papers. “What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?” said I, now jumping on the
bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf. “I mean,” he replied, “he must show his papers.”
“Yes,” said Captain Bildad in his hollow  voice, sticking his head from behind
Peleg’ s, out of the wigwam. “He must show that he’s converted. Son of
darkness,” he added, turning to Queequeg, “art thou at present in communion
with any Christian church?”
“Why ,” said I, “he’s a member of the first Congregational Church.” Here be it
said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be
converted into the churches. “First Congregational Church,” cried Bildad, “what! that worships in Deacon
Deuteronomy Coleman’ s meeting-house?” and so saying, taking out his
spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 64/353putting them on very carefully , came out of the wigwam, and leaning stiffly over
the bulwarks, took a good long look at Queequeg. “How long hath he been a member?” he then said, turning to me; “not very
long, I rather guess, young man.”
“No,” said Peleg, “and he hasn’ t been baptized right either , or it would have
washed some of that devil’ s blue of f his face.”
“Do tell, now,” cried Bildad, “is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon
Deuteronomy’ s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass it every Lord’ s
day.”
“I don’t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,” said I;
“all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First Congregationa l
Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.”
“Young man,” said Bildad sternly , “thou art skylarking with me—explain
thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.”
Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. “I mean, sir, the same ancient
Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg
here, and all of us, and every mother ’s son and soul of us belong; the great and
everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world; we all belong to
that; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand
belief; in that we all join hands.”
“Splice, thou mean’ st splice  hands,” cried Peleg,  drawing nearer . “Young man,
you’d better ship for a missionary , instead of a fore-mast hand; I never heard a
better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy—why Father Mapple himself couldn’ t beat
it, and he’s reckoned  something. Come aboard, come aboard; never mind abou t
the papers . I say, tell Quohog there—what’ s that you call him? tell Quohog to
step along. By the great anchor , what a harpoon he’s got there! looks like good
stuff that; and he handles it about right . I say, Quohog, or whatever your name
is, did you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?”
Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon the
bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to the
side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his harpoon, cried out in some
such way as this:—
“Cap’ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well, spose
him one whale eye, well, den!” and taking sharp aim at it, he darted the iron
right over old Bildad’ s broad brim, clean across the ship’ s decks, and struck the
glistening tar spot out of sight. “Now ,” said Queequ eg, quietly hauling in the line, “spos-ee him whale-e eye;
why, dad whale dead.”
“Quick, Bildad,” said Peleg, his partne r, who, aghast at the close vicinity of
the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway . “Quick, I say, you
Bildad, and get the ship’ s papers. We must have Hedgehog there, I mean
Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog, we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay,
and that’ s more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.”
So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon
enrolled among the same ship’ s company to which I myself belonged. When all prelimina ries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for
signing, he turned to me and said, “I guess, Quohog there don’t know how to
write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name or make thy
mark?”
But at this question , Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken part in
similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the offered pen, copied6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 65/353upon the paper , in the proper place, an exact counterpart of a queer round figure
which was tattooed upon his arm; so that through Captain Peleg’ s obstinate
mistake touching his appellative, it stood something like this:—
Quohog. his X mark. Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly  and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg, and
at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad-skirted
drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one entitled “The Latter Day
Coming; or No Time to Lose,” placed it in Queequeg’ s hands, and then grasping
them and the book with both his, looke d earnestly into his eyes, and said, “Son
of darknes s, I must do my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel
concerned for the souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways,
which I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial bondsman. Spurn
the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind thine
eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!”
Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad’ s language,
heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases. “Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast  now spoiling our harpooneer ,” cried
Peleg. “Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers—it takes the shark out of
’em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish. There was young
Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard;
he joined the meeting, and never came to good. He got so frightened about his
plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheer ed away from whales, for fear of after-
claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.”
“Peleg! Peleg!” said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, “thou thyself, as I
myself, hast seen many a perilous time;  thou knowest, Peleg, what it is to have
the fear of death; how, then, can’st thou prate in this ungodly guise. Thou beliest
thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this same Pequod here had her three mast s
overboard in that typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate
with Captain Ahab, did’ st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?”
“Hear him, hear him now,” cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and
thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,—“hear him, all of ye. Think of
that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death and the
Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an everlasting
thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us, fore and aft. Think
of Death and the Judgment then?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"No! no time to think about Death then. Life
was what Captain Ahab and I was think ing of; and how to save all hands—how
to rig jury-masts—how to get into the nearest port; that was what I was thinking
of.”
Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where we
followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who
were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he stooped to pick up a
patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which otherwise might have been wasted. CHAPTER 19.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from the
water , for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the above6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 66/353words were put to us by a stranger , who, pausing before us, levelled his massive
forefinger at the vessel in question. He was but shabbily apparelled in faded
jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck. A
confluent small-pox  had in all directions flowed over his face, and left it like the
complicated ribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up. “Have ye shipped in her?” he repeated. “You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,” said I, trying to gain a little more
time for an uninterrupted look at him. “Aye, the Pequod— that ship there,” he said, drawing back his whole arm, and
then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed bayonet of his
pointed finger darted full at the object. “Yes,” said I, “we have just signed the articles.”
“Anything down there about your souls?”
“About what?”
“Oh, perhaps you hav’n’ t got any,” he said quickly . “No matter though, I
know many chaps that hav’n’ t got any,—good luck to ’em; and they are all the
better of f for it. A soul’ s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon.”
“What are you jabbering about, shipmate?” said I. “He’s got enough, though , to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in other
chaps,” abruptly said the stranger , placing a nervous emphasis upon the word he. “Queequeg,” said I, “let’s go; this fellow has broken loose from somewhere;
he’s talking about something and somebody we don’ t know .”
“Stop!” cried the stranger . “Ye said true—ye hav’n’ t seen Old Thunder yet,
have ye?”
“Who’ s Old Thunde r?” said I, again riveted with the insane earnestness of his
manner . “Captain Ahab.”
“What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?”
“Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye hav’n’ t
seen him yet, have ye?”
“No, we hav’n’ t. He’s sick they say, but is getting better , and will be all right
again before long.”
“All right again before long!” laughed the stranger , with a solemnly derisive
sort of laugh. “Loo k ye; when Captain  Ahab is all right, then this left arm of
mine will be all right; not before.”
“What do you know about him?”
“What did they tell you about him? Say that!”
“They didn’t tell much of anything about him; only I’ve heard that he’s a good
whale-hunter , and a good captain to his crew .”
“That’ s true, that’s true—yes, both true enough. But you must jump when he
gives an order . Step and growl; growl  and go—that’ s the word with Captain
Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn, long
ago, when  he lay like dead for three days and nights; nothing about that deadly
skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in Santa?—heard nothing about
that, eh? Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into? And nothing about his
losing his leg last voyage, according to the prophecy . Didn’ t ye hear a word
about them  matters and something more , eh? No, I don’t think ye did; how could
ye? Who knows it?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows’ever , mayhap, ye’ve
heard tell about the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

that a parmacetti took the other of f.”
“My friend,” said I, “what all this gibberish of yours is about, I don’t know ,
and I don’t much care; for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in
the head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab, of that ship there, the
Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all about the loss of his leg.”
“All about it, eh—sure you do?—all?”
“Pretty sure.”
With finge r pointed  and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar -like stranger
stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a little, turned and said:
—“Y e’ve shipped, have ye? Names down on the papers? Well, well, what’ s
signed, is signed; and what’ s to be, will be; and then again, perhaps it won’ t be,
after all. Anyhow , it’s all fixed and arranged a’ready; and some sailors or other
must go with him, I suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity ’em! Morning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I’m sorry I
stopped ye.”
“Look here, friend,”  said I, “if you have anything important to tell us, out with
it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are mistaken in your game;
that’s all I have to say .”
“And it’s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way; you are
just the man for him—the likes of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates, morning! Oh! when ye get there, tell ’em I’ve concluded not to make one of ’em.”
“Ah, my dear fellow , you can’t fool us that way—you can’t fool us. It is the
easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him.”
“Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.”
“Morning it is,” said I. “Come along, Queequeg, let’s leave this crazy man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?”
“Elijah.”
Elijah! thought I, and we walked away , both commenting, after each other ’s
fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was nothing but a
humbug, trying to be a bugbear . But we had not gone perhaps above a hundred
yards, when chancin g to turn a corner , and looking back as I did so, who should
be seen but Elijah following us, though at a distance. Somehow , the sight of him
struck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on
with my comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same
corner that we did.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"He did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us, but
with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This circumstance,
coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk,
now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all
connected with the Pequod; and Captain  Ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the
Cape Horn  fit; and the silver calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him,
when I left the ship the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig; and
the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy things. I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really dogging
us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg, and on that side
of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on, without seeming to notice us. This
relieved me; and once more, and finally  as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in
my heart, a humbug.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

"A day or two passed , and there was great activity aboard the Pequod. Not only
were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on board, and bolts
of canvas,  and coils of rigging; in short, everything betokened that the ship’ s
preparations were hurrying to a close . Captain Peleg seldom or never went
ashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad
did all the purchasin g and providing at the stores; and the men employed in the
hold and on the rigging were working till long after night-fall. On the day followin g Queequeg’ s signing the articles, word was given at all
the inns where the ship’ s company were stopping, that their chests must be on
board before night, for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing . So Queequ eg and I got down our traps,  resolving, however , to sleep ashore till
the last. But it seems they always give very long notice in these cases, and the
ship did not sail for several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be
done, and there is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the
Pequod was fully equipped. Every one knows what a multitude of things—beds, sauce-pans, knives and
forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-c rackers, and what not, are indispensable
to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling, which necessitates a
three-years’  housek eeping upon the wide ocean, far from all grocers,
costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And though this also holds true of
merchant vessels, yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen . For besid es the great length of the whaling voyage, the numerous articles
peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery , and the impossibility of replacing them
at the remote harbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all
ships, whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and
especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success
of the voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare lines
and harpo ons, and spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain and duplicate
ship. At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the Pequod
had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water , fuel, and iron
hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time there was a continua l
fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things, both large and
small. Chief among those who did this fetchin g and carrying was Captain Bildad’ s
sister , a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit, but withal
very kindh earted, who seemed resolved that, if she could help it, nothing should
be found wanting in the Pequod, after once fairly getting to sea. At one time she
would come on board with a jar of pickl es for the steward’ s pantry; another time
with a bunch of quills for the chief mate’ s desk, where he kept his log; a third
time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one’s rheumatic back. Never did
any woma n better deserve her name, which was Charity—Aunt Charity , as
everybody called her. And like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity
bustle about hither and thither , ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that
promised to yield safety , comfort, and consolation to all on board a ship in
which her beloved brother Bildad was concerned, and in which she herself
owned a score or two of well-saved dollars. But it was startling to see this excellent  hearted Quakeress coming on board,
as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and a still longer
whaling lance in the other . Nor was Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg at all6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 69/353backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him a long list of the article s
needed, and at every  fresh arrival, down  went his mark opposite that article upon
the paper . Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den,
roaring at the men down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-
head, and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam. During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the craft, and
as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when he was going to
come on board his ship. To these questions they would answer , that he was
getting better and better , and was expect ed aboard every day; meantime, the two
captains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel
for the voyage. If I had been downright  honest with myself, I would have seen
very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so
long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the
absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea. But
when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already
involved in the matter , he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from
himself. And much this way it was with me.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"I said nothing, and tried to think
nothing. At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start. CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard. It was nearly six o’clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we drew
nigh the wharf. “There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,” said I to
Queequeg, “it can’ t be shadows; she’ s off by sunrise, I guess; come on!”
“Avast!” cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind us,
laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself between us,
stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight, strangely peering from
Queequeg to me. It was Elijah. “Going aboard?”
“Hands of f, will you,” said I. “Lookee here,” said Queequeg, shaking himself, “go ’way!”
“Ain’ t going aboard, then?”
“Yes, we are,” said I, “but what busines s is that of yours? Do you know , Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?”
“No, no, no; I wasn’t aware of that,” said Elijah, slowly and wonderingly
looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable glances. “Elijah,” said I, “you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We are
going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be detained.”
“Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?”
“He’ s cracked, Queequeg,” said I, “come on.”
“Holloa!” cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few
paces. “Never mind him,” said I, “Queequeg, come on.”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 70/353But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder ,
said—“Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while
ago?”
Struck by this plain matter -of-fact question, I answered, saying, “Yes, I
thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.”
“Very dim, very dim,” said Elijah. “Morning to ye.”
Once more we quitted him; but once  more he came softly after us; and
touching my shoulder again, said, “See if you can find ’em now , will ye? “Find who?”
“Morning to ye! morning to ye!” he rejoined, again moving off. “Oh! I was
going to warn ye against—but never mind, never mind—it’ s all one, all in the
family too;—sharp frost this morning, ain’t it? Good-bye to ye. Shan’ t see ye
again very soon, I guess; unless it’s before the Grand Jury.” And with these
cracked words he finally departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small
wonderment at his frantic impudence. At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound quiet,
not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the hatches were all
on, and lumbered with coils of riggin g. Going forward to the forecastle, we
found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a light, we went down, and found
only an old rigger there, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at
whole length upon two chests, his face downwards and inclosed in his folded
arms. The profoundest slumber slept upon him. “Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?” said I,
looking dubiously at the sleeper . But it seemed that, when on the wharf,
Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I would have
thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter , were it not for
Elijah’ s otherwise inexplicable question . But I beat the thing down; and again
marking the sleeper , jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit
up with the body; telling him to establi sh himself accordingly . He put his hand
upon the sleeper ’s rear, as though feeling  if it was soft enough; and then, without
more ado, sat quietly down there. “Gracious! Queequeg, don’ t sit there,” said I. “Oh! perry dood seat,” said Queequeg, “my country way; won’ t hurt him
face.”
“Face!” said I, “call that his face? very benevolent countenance then; but how
hard he breathes, he’s heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you are heavy , it’s
grinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look, he’ll twitch you off
soon. I wonder he don’ t wake.”
Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper , and lighted
his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing over the sleeper ,
from one to the other . Meanwhile, upon questioning him in his broken fashion,
Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his land, owing to the absence of
settees and sofas of all sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally , were in
the custom of fatten ing some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a
house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy
fellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was very
convenient on an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs which are
convertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and
desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps in some
damp marshy place.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 71/353While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk
from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper ’s head. “What’ s that for , Queequeg?”
“Perry easy , kill-e; oh! perry easy!”
He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,
which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul,
when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger . The strong vapor now
completely filling the contracted hole, it began to tell upon him.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"He breathed
with a sort of muffledness; then seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over
once or twice; then sat up and rubbed his eyes. “Holloa!” he breathed at last, “who be ye smokers?”
“Shipped men,” answered I, “when does she sail?”
“Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day . The Captain came
aboard last night.”
“What Captain?—Ahab?”
“Who but him indeed?”
I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we
heard a noise on deck. “Holloa! Starbuck’ s astir,” said the rigger . “He’ s a lively chief mate, that;
good man,  and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.” And so saying he went
on deck, and we followed. It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and threes; the
riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively engaged; and several of the
shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board. Meanwhile
Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin. CHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas. At length,  towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship’ s riggers, and
after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the ever-
thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with her last gift—a night-cap
for Stubb, the secon d mate, her brother -in-law , and a spare Bible for the steward
—after all this, the two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and
turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:
“Now , Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is all
ready—just spoke to him—nothing more to be got from shore, eh? Well, call all
hands, then. Muster ’em aft here—blast ’em!”
“No need of profane  words, however great the hurry , Peleg,” said Bildad, “but
away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.”
How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain Peleg
and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter -deck, just as if
they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as well as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he
was in the cabin. But then, the idea was, that his presence was by no mean s
necessary in getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed, as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot’ s; and as he was6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 72/353not yet completely recovered—so they said—therefore, Captain Ahab stayed
below . And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant service
many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after
heaving up the anchor , but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell merry-
making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for good with the pilot. But there was not much chance to think over the matter , for Captain Peleg
was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding, and
not Bildad. “Aft here,  ye sons of bachelors,” he cried, as the sailors lingered at the main-
mast. “Mr . Starbuck, drive ’em aft.”
“Strike the tent there!”—was the next order . As I hinted before, this
whalebone marquee  was never pitched except in port; and on board the Pequod,
for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing
to heaving up the anchor . “Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!—jump!”—was the next command, and
the crew sprang for the handspikes. Now in getting unde r weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot is the
forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it known, in
addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots of the port—he
being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket
pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other craft
—Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows
for the approaching anchor , and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave
of psalmody , to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of a
chorus about the girls in Booble Alley , with hearty good will. Nevertheless, not
three days previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be
allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and Charity ,
his sister , had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman’ s berth. Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped and
swore astern in the most frightful manner . I almost thought he would sink the
ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I paused on my handspike ,
and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the perils we both ran, in starting
on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot. I was comforting myself, however ,
with the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his
seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my
rear, and turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the
act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity . That was my first kick. “Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?” he roared. “Spring, thou
sheep-head; spring, and break thy back bone! Why don’t ye spring, I say, all of
ye—spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red whiskers; spring there,
Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I say, all of ye, and spring your
eyes out!”  And so saying, he moved along the windlass, here and there using his
leg very freely , while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody . Thinks I, Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day . At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It was a short,
cold Chris tmas; and as the short northern day merged into night, we found
ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose freezing spray cased us in
ice, as in polished armor . The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the
moonlight; and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving
icicles depended from the bows. Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the old
craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost all over her, and6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 73/353the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady notes were heard,—
      “Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,
         Stand dr essed in living gr een. So to the Jews old Canaan stood,
         While Jor dan r olled between.”
Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They were
full of hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous
Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wette r jacket, there was yet, it then seemed to
me, many a pleasant haven in store; and meads and glades so eternally vernal ,
that the grass shot up by the spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer . At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no longer .","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside. It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected at this
juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet; very loath to leave,
for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage—beyond both stormy
Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested ;
a ship, in which an old shipmate sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he,
once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath to say
good-bye to a thing  so every way brimful of every interest to him,—poor old
Bildad lingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down into the
cabin to speak anoth er farewell word there; again came on deck, and looked to
windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters, only bounded by the
far-off unseen Eastern Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked
right and left; looked  everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling
a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and holding
up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say,
“Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.”
As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all his
philosophy , there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern came too
near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck—now a word below ,
and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate. But, at last, he turned to his comrade,  with a final sort of look about him,
—“Captain Bildad— come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the main-yard there!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now! Careful, careful!—come ,
Bildad, boy—say your last. Luck to ye, Starbuck—luck to ye, Mr. Stubb—luck
to ye, Mr. Flask—go od-bye and good luck to ye all—and this day three years I’ll
have a hot supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!”
“God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,” murmured old Bildad,
almost incoherently . “I hope ye’ll have fine weather now, so that Captain Ahab
may soon be movin g among ye—a pleasant sun is all he needs, and ye’ll have
plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be careful in the hunt, ye mates. Don’ t stave the boats needlessly , ye harpooneers; good white cedar plank is

hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat. Ship and boat diver ged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a
screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave three heavy-
hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone Atlantic. CHAPTER 23.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Lee Shor e. Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded
mariner , encountered in New Bedford at the inn. When on that shivering winter ’s night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive bows
into the cold malic ious waves, who should I see standing at her helm but
Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man, who
in mid-wi nter just landed from a four years’  dangerous voyage, could so
unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term. The land seemed
scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep
memories yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of
Bulkington. Let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship,
that miserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give succor;
the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper , warm
blankets, friends, all that’s kind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the
land, is that ship’ s direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land,
though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through. With
all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights ’gainst the very
winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea’s
landlessness again; for refuge’ s sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend
her bitterest foe! Know ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the
soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the wildest winds of
heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous, slavish shore? But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless, indefinite as God
—so, bette r is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be ingloriously dashed
upon the lee, even if that were safety! For worm-like, then, oh! who would
craven crawl to land! Terrors of the terrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart,
take heart, O Bulkin gton! Bear thee grimly , demigod! Up from the spray of thy
ocean-perishing—straight up, leaps thy apotheosis! CHAPTER 24.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Advocate. As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling; and
as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen
as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety to
convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 75/353In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact,
that amon g people at large, the busines s of whaling is not accounted on a level
with what are called the liberal professions. If a stranger were introduced into
any miscellaneous metropolitan society , it would but slightly advance the
general opinion of his merits, were he presented to the company as a harpooneer ,
say; and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale Fishe ry) to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed
pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous. Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen,
is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of
business; and that when actively enga ged therein, we are surrounded by all
manner of defileme nts. Butchers we are, that is true. But butchers, also, and
butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the
world invariably delights to honor . And as for the matter of the alleged
uncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto
pretty generally unknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant
the sperm whale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But
even grant ing the charge in question to be true; what disordered slippery decks
of a whale -ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle-field s
from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies’  plaudits? And if the
idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier ’s profession ;
let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery ,
would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale’ s vast tail, fanning into
eddies the air over his head. For what  are the comprehensible terrors of man
compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of God! But, thoug h the world scouts at us whal e hunters, yet does it unwittingly pay
us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding adoration! for almost all the
tapers, lamps, and candles that burn round the globe, burn, as before so many
shrines, to our glory! But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of scales; see what
we whalemen are, and have been. Why did the Dutch in De Witt’s time have admirals of their whaling fleets? Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit out whaling
ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some score or two of
families from our own island of Nantuc ket? Why did Britain between the years
1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of £1,000,000? And
lastly , how comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of
the bande d whalemen in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred
vessels; manned by eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of
dollars; the ships worth, at the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year
importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all
this, if there be not something puissant in whaling? But this is not the half; look again. I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life, point out
one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty years has operated
more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in one aggregate, than the
high and mighty business of whaling. One way and another , it has begotten
events so remarkab le in themselves, and so continuously momentous in their
sequential issues, that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother ,
who bore offspring themselves pregnant  from her womb. It would be a hopeless,
endless task to catalogue all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many years
past the whale-ship has been the pionee r in ferreting out the remotest and least
known parts of the earth. She has explor ed seas and archipelagoes which had no6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 76/353chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. If American and European
men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors, let them fire salutes to
the honor and glory  of the whale-ship, which originally showed them the way,
and first interpreted between them and the savages. They may celebrate as they
will the heroes of Exploring Expedition s, your Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I
say that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket, that were
as great, and greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern. For in their
succourless empty-h andedness, they, in the heathenish sharked waters, and by
the beach es of unrecorded, javelin islands, battled with virgin wonders and
terrors that Cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have
dared. All that is made such a flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those
things were but the life-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers. Often ,
adventures which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted
unworthy of being set down in the ship’ s common log. Ah, the world!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Oh, the
world! Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,
scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe and the
long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast. It was the
whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish crown ,
touching those colonies; and, if space permitted, it might be distinctly shown
how from  those whalemen at last even tuated the liberation of Peru, Chili, and
Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain, and the establishment of the eternal
democracy in those parts. That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was given to the
enlightened world by the whaleman. After its first blunder -born discovery by a
Dutchman, all other ships long shunned  those shores as pestiferously barbarous;
but the whale-ship touched there. The whale-ship is the true mother of that now
mighty colony. Moreover , in the infanc y of the first Australian settlement, the
emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of
the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters. The uncounted isles
of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do commercial homage to the
whale-ship, that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant, and in
many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations. If that
double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship
alone to whom the credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold. But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no æsthetically
noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with
you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet every time. The whale has no famous author , and whaling no famous chronicler , you will
say. The whale  no famous author , and whaling no famous chronicler? Who wrote
the first account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job! And who composed the
first narra tive of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a prince than Alfred the
Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down the words from Other , the
Norwegian whale-h unter of those times! And who pronounced our glowing
eulogy in Parliament? Who, but Edmund Burke! True enough, but then whalemen them selves are poor devils; they have no

the whale is declared “a royal fish.” *
Oh, that’s only nominal! The whale himself has never figured in any grand
imposing way . The whale never figur ed in any grand imposing way? In one of the mighty
triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the world’ s capital, the
bones of a whale, brought all the way from the Syrian coast, were the most
conspicuous object in the cymballed procession.*
*See subsequent chapters for something more on this head. Grant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real dignity in
whaling. No dignity  in whaling? The dignity of our calling the very heavens attest. Cetus is a constellat ion in the South! No more! Drive down your hat in presence
of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg! No more! I know a man that, in his
lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty whales. I account that man more
honorable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many
walled towns. And, as for me, if, by any possibility , there be any as yet undiscovered prime
thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed
world which I migh t not be unreasona bly ambitious of; if hereafter I shall do
anything that, upon the whole, a man might rather have done than to have left
undone; if, at my death, my executors, or more properly my creditors, find any
precious MSS. in my desk, then here I prospectively ascribe all the honor and
the glory to whaling; for a whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard. CHAPTER 25. Postscript. In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but
substantiated facts. But after embattli ng his facts, an advocate who should
wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell eloquently upon
his cause—such an advocate, would he not be blameworthy? It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even modern
ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone
through.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"There is a saltcellar of state, so called, and there may be a castor of
state. How they use the salt, precisely—who knows? Certain I am, however , that
a king’ s head is solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it
be, though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well, as they
anoint machinery? Much might be ruminated here, concerning the essential
dignity of this regal process, because in common life we esteem but meanly and
contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that
anointing. In truth, a mature man who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally , that man
has probab ly got a quoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general rule, he can’t
amount to much in his totality .6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

"Knights and
Squir es. The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a
Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy
coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard as twice-
baked biscuit. Transported to the Indie s, his live blood would not spoil like
bottled ale. He must have been born in some time of general drought and
famine, or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous. Only some
thirty arid summers had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical
superfluousness. But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of
wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It
was merely the condensation of the man.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"He was by no means ill-looking; quite
the contra ry. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in
it, and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified Egyptian, this
Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come, and to endure
always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer , his
interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates. Looking into his eyes,
you seemed to see there the yet lingering  images of those thousand-fold perils he
had calml y confron ted through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life for the
most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame chapter of sounds . Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortit ude, there were certain qualities in him
which at times affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all
the rest. Uncommo nly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep
natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly
incline him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some
organizations seems rather to spring, somehow , from intelligence than from
ignorance. Outward portents and inward  presentiments were his. And if at times
these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away
domestic memories of his young Cape  wife and child, tend to bend him still
more from  the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to
those laten t influenc es which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of
dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of
the fishery . “I will have no man in my boat,” said Starbuck, “who is not afraid of
a whale.” By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful
courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril,
but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward. “Aye, aye,” said Stubb, the second mate, “Starbuck, there, is as careful a man
as you’ll find anywh ere in this fishery .” But we shall ere long see what that word
“careful” precisely means when used by a man like Stubb, or almost any other
whale hunter .6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 79/353Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a sentiment; but
a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all mortally practica l
occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this business of whaling ,
courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship, like her beef and her
bread, and not to be foolishly wasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering
for whales after sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much
persisted in fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical ocean
to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for theirs; and that
hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew . What doom was his
own father ’s? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his
brother? With memories like these in him, and, moreover , given to a certain
superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which could,
nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But it was not in
reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such terrible experience s
and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature that these things should fail in
latently engendering an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances,
would break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as
he might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly , visible in some intrepid men,
which, while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or
whales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot
withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes
menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man. But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete
abasement of poor Starbuck’ s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to write it;
for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose the fall of valour in the
soul. Men may seem  detestable as joint stock-companies and nations; knaves ,
fools, and murderers there may be; men may have mean and meagre faces; but
man, in the ideal, is so noble and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing
creature, that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to
throw their costliest robes. That immacu late manliness we feel within ourselves,
so far within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone ;
bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor -ruined man. Nor can piety itself,  at such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraiding s
against the permitting stars. But this august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of
kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture . Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that
democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from God; Himself! The great God absolute! The centre and circumference of all democracy! His
omnipresence, our divine equality! If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall hereafter
ascribe high qualitie s, though dark; weave round them tragic graces; if even the
most mournful, perchance the most abased, among them all, shall at times lift
himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall touch that workman’ s arm with some
ethereal light; if I shall spread a rainb ow over his disastrous set of sun; then
against all mortal critics bear me out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality , which hast
spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou
great democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict, Bunyan, the
pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest
gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst pick up
Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a war-horse; who

"Knights and
Squir es. Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,
according to local usage, was called  a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;
neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an indifferent air; and
while enga ged in the most imminent crisis of the chase, toiling away , calm and
collected as a journe yman joiner engaged for the year. Good-humored, easy, and
careless, he presided  over his whale-bo at as if the most deadly encounter were
but a dinner , and his crew all invited guests. He was as particular about the
comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about
the snugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very death-lock of the
fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly , as a whistling
tinker his hammer . He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and
flank with the most exasperated monster . Long usage had, for this Stubb ,
converted the jaws of death into an easy chair . What he thought of death itself,
there is no telling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question; but,
if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner , no
doubt, like a good sailor , he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble
aloft, and bestir themselves there, about something which he would find out
when he obeyed the order , and not sooner . What, perhaps, with other things, made  Stubb such an easy-going, unfearing
man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave
pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs; what helped to bring about
that almost impious good-humor of his; that thing must have been his pipe. For,
like his nose, his short, black little pipe was one of the regular features of his
face. You would almost as soon have  expected him to turn out of his bunk
without his nose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready
loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever he turned
in, he smoked them all out in successio n, lighting one from the other to the end
of the chap ter; then loading them again to be in readiness anew . For, when Stubb
dressed, instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his
mouth. I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his
peculiar disposition; for every one know s that this earthly air, whether ashore or
afloat, is terribly infected with the name less miseries of the numberless mortals
who have died exha ling it; and as in time of the cholera, some people go about
with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal
tribulations, Stubb’ s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting
agent. The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury , in Martha’ s Vineyard. A short,
stout, ruddy young fellow , very pugnacious concerning whales, who somehow
seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily
affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of honor with him, to destroy
them whenever encountered. So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 81/353the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to
anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them ;
that in his poor opinion, the wondrous  whale was but a species of magnified
mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small
application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This ignorant,
unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of
whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years’  voyage round
Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time. As a carpenter ’s
nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly
divided. Little Flask was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last
long. They  called him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he
could be well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in Arctic
whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it,
serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas. Now these three mates—Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous men. They it was who by universal prescrip tion commanded three of the Pequod’ s
boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would
probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales, these three headsmen
were as captains of companies. Or, being armed with their long keen whaling
spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers; even as the harpooneers were
flingers of javelins. And since  in this famous fishery , each mate or headsman, like a Gothic
Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer , who in
certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the former one has
been badly  twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and moreover , as there generally
subsists between the two, a close intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore but
meet, that in this place we set down who the Pequod’ s harpooneers were, and to
what headsman each of them belonged. First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected for
his squire. But Queequeg is already known. Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly
promontory of Martha’ s Vineyard, where there still exists the last remnant of a
village of red men, which has long supp lied the neighboring island of Nantucke t
with many of her most daring harpooneers. In the fishery , they usually go by the
generic name of Gay-Headers. Tashtego’ s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek
bones, and black rounding eyes—for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but
Antarctic in their glittering expression—all this sufficiently proclaimed him an
inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of
the great New Engla nd moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests
of the main. But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the
woodland, Tashtego  now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the
unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires. To
look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have
credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans, and half-believed this
wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air. Tashtego was
Stubb the second mate’ s squire. Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black negro-
savage, with a lion-l ike tread—an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended from his ears
were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called them ring-bolts, and
would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to them. In his youth Daggoo had
voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler , lying in a lonely bay on his native
coast. And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket,
and the pagan harbo rs most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 82/353many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly
heedful of what manner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric
virtues, and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet
five in his socks. There was a corporea l humility in looking up at him; and a
white man standing before him seeme d a white flag come to beg truce of a
fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the Squire
of little Flask, who looked like a chess-m an beside him. As for the residue of the
Pequod’ s company , be it said, that at the present day not one in two of the many
thousand men before the mast employed in the American whale fishery , are
Americans born, though pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same
with the American whale fishery as with the American army and military and
merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the
American Canals and Railroads. The same, I say, because in all these cases the
native American liberally provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously
supplying the muscles. No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the
Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to
augment their crew s from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like
manner , the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the
Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew . Upon the passage
homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling, but
Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all Islanders in the
Pequod, Isolatoes  too, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent of
men, but each Isolato  living on a separate continent of his own. Yet now,
federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz
deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth,
accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world’ s grievances before that
bar from which not very many of them  ever come back. Black Little Pip—he

"Ahab. For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen of
Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches, and for
aught that could be seen to the contrary , they seemed to be the only commander s
of the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden
and peremptory , that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously . Yes,
their supre me lord and dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes
not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin. Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below , I instantly gazed
aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague disquietude
touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea, became almost a
perturbation. This was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah’ s
diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could
not have before conceived of. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in
other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 83/353outlandish prophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or
uneasiness—to call it so—which I felt, yet whenever I came to look about me in
the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions. For though
the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew , were a far more barbaric,
heathenish, and motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which
my previous experiences had made me acquainted with, still I ascribed this—
and rightly  ascribed  it—to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild
Scandinavian vocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was
especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was
most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and induce
confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage. Three better ,
more likely sea-of ficers and men, each in his own different way, could not
readily be found, and they were every one of them Americans; a Nantucketer , a
Vineyarder , a Cape man. Now , it being Christmas when the ship shot from out
her harbor , for a space we had biting Polar weather , though all the time running
away from it to the southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which
we sailed, gradually leaving that mercile ss winter , and all its intolerable weather
behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy enough
mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through
the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity , that as I
mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my
glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran
apprehension; Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter -deck. There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the
recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the fire
has overru nningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or taking away
one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His whole high, broad form,
seemed made of solid bronze, and shape d in an unalterable mould, like Cellini’ s
cast Perseus. Threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing
right down  one side of his tawny scorc hed face and neck, till it disappeared in
his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like  mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that
perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great tree,
when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single
twig, peels  and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off into the
soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born
with him, or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could
certainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion
was made to it, especially by the mates. But once Tashtego’ s senior , an old Gay-
Head Indian among  the crew , superstit iously asserted that not till he was full
forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him,
not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild
hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old
sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere
this laid eye upon  wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the
immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with preternatural
powers of discernment. So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when
he said that if ever Captain Ahab shou ld be tranquilly laid out—which migh t
hardly come to pass, so he muttered—t hen, whoever should do that last office
for the dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole. So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid
brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a
little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon
which he partly stood. It had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea
been fashi oned from the polished bone of the sperm whale’ s jaw. “Aye, he was6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 84/353dismasted off Japan,” said the old Gay-Head Indian once; “but like his
dismasted craft, he shipped another mast without coming home for it. He has a
quiver of ’em.”
I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of the
Pequod’ s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds, there was an
auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank. His bone leg steadied
in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood
erect, looking straig ht out beyond the ship’ s ever-pitching prow . There was an
infinity of firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the
fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor
did his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest gestures and
expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy , if not painful, consciousness of
being under a troubled master -eye. And not only that, but moody stricken Ahab
stood before them with a crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal
overbearing dignity of some mighty woe. Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin. But after
that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either standing in his pivot -
hole, or seated upon  an ivory stool he had; or heavily walking the deck. As the
sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less
and less a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the
dead wintr y bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by,
it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet, for all that
he said, or perceptib ly did, on the at last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary
there as another mast. But the Pequod was only making a passage now; not
regularly cruising; nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mate s
were fully competent to, so that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to
employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away , for that one interval, the
clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow , as ever all clouds choose
the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon. Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant,
holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from his mood . For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to the
wintry , misanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest, most thunder -cloven old
oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-
hearted visitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a little respond to the playful alluring s
of that girlish air. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look,
which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile. CHAPTER 29.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Enter  Ahab; to
Him, Stubb. Some days elapsed,  and ice and iceber gs all astern, the Pequod now went
rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost perpetually reign s
on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic. The warmly cool, clear ,
ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, were as crystal goblets of
Persian sherbet, heaped up—flaked up, with rose-water snow . The starred and
stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in
lonely pride, the memory of their absen t conquering Earls, the golden helmeted6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

such seducing night s. But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not
merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world. Inward they turned
upon the soul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then,
memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights. And
all these subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab’ s texture. Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less man has
to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders, the old
greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked deck. It was
so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he seemed so much to live in the open air,
that truly speaking, his visits were more  to the cabin, than from the cabin to the
planks. “It feels like going down into one’s tomb,”—he would mutter to himself
—“for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my
grave-dug berth.”
So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were set,
and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below; and when if a
rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors flung it not rudely down,
as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing
their slum bering shipmates; when this sort of steady quietude would begin to
prevail, habitually , the silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere
long the old man would emer ge, gripping at the iron banister , to help his
crippled way. Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like
these, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter -deck; because to his
wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would
have been the rever berating crack and din of that bony step, that their dreams
would have been on the crunching teeth  of sharks. But once, the mood was on
him too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy , lumber -like pace he
was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate,
came up from below, with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness,
hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could
say nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting something
indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the insertion into it, of the
ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab then. “Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,” said Ahab, “that thou wouldst wad me that
fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave; where such
as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at last.—Down, dog,
and kennel!”
Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful
old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly , “I am not used to
be spoken to that way , sir; I do but less than half like it, sir .”
“Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away , as if to
avoid some passionate temptation. “No, sir; not yet,” said Stubb, emboldened, “I will not tamely be called a dog,
sir.”
“Then be called ten times a donkey , and a mule, and an ass, and begone, or
I’ll clear the world of thee!”
As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his
aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated. “I was never served  so before without giving a hard blow for it,” muttered
Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. “It’s very queer . Stop,
Stubb; somehow , now, I don’t well know whether to go back and strike him, or
—what’ s that?—down here on my knees and pray for him? Yes, that was the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

queer; very queer; and he’s queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, he’s about the

"Anyway there’ s something on his mind, as sure as
there must be something on a deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either ,
more than three hours out of the twent y-four; and he don’t sleep then. Didn’ t

man’ s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the
foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of frightful
hot, as though a baked brick had been on it? A hot old man! I guess he’s got
what some folks ashore call a conscienc e; it’s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say
—worse nor a tooth ache. Well, well; I don’t know what it is, but the Lord keep
me from catching it. He’s full of riddle s; I wonder what he goes into the after
hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what’ s that for, I
should like to know? Who’ s made appointments with him in the hold? Ain’t that

CHAPTER 30. The Pipe. When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks;
and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor of the watch, he
sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe. Lighting the pipe at the
binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck, he sat and
smoked. In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were
fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could one look at
Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bone s, without bethinking him of the royalty
it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank, and a king of the sea, and a great lord of
Leviathans was Ahab. Some mom ents passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in
quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. “How now,” he
soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, “this smoking no longer soothes. Oh,
my pipe!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone! Here have I been
unconsciously toiling, not pleasurin g—aye, and ignorantly smoking to

business have I with this pipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send
up mild white vapors among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks
like mine. I’ll smoke no more—”
He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the waves; the
same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made. With slouched
hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks. CHAPTER 31.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Queen Mab. Next morning Stubb accosted Flask. “Such a queer dream, King-Post, I neve r had. You know the old man’ s ivory
leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back, upon my
soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto! Ahab seemed a
pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But what was still more
curious, Flask—you  know how curious all dreams are—through all this rage that
I was in, I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not
much of an insult, that kick from Ahab. ‘Why ,’ thinks I, ‘what’ s the row? It’s not
a real leg, only a false leg.’ And there’ s a mighty difference between a living
thump and a dead thump. That’ s what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty
times more savage to bear than a blow  from a cane. The living member—that
makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the while, mind,
while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid—so
confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I say, I was thinking to
myself, ‘what’ s his leg now, but a cane—a whalebone cane. Yes,’ thinks I, ‘it
was only a playful cudgelling—in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me—
not a base kick. Besides,’  thinks I, ‘look at it once; why, the end of it—the foot
part—what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me,
there’s a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a point only.’
But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I was battering
away at the pyramid, a sort of badger -haired old merman, with a hump on his
back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round. ‘What are you ’bout?’
says he.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Slid! man, but I was frighten ed. Such a phiz! But, somehow , next
moment I was over the fright. ‘What am I about?’  says I at last. ‘And what
business is that of yours, I should like to know , Mr. Humpback? Do you want a
kick?’  By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned round his
stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout—
what do you think, I saw?—why thunde r alive, man, his stern was stuck full of
marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on second thoughts, ‘I guess I won’ t
kick you, old fellow .’ ‘Wise Stubb,’  said he, ‘wise Stubb;’  and kept muttering it
all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he
wasn’ t going to stop saying over his ‘wise Stubb, wise Stubb,’  I thought I migh t
as well fall to kicking the pyramid again . But I had only just lifted my foot for it,
when he roared out, ‘Stop that kicking!’  ‘Halloa,’  says I, ‘what’ s the matter now,
old fellow?’  ‘Look ye here,’  says he; ‘let’s argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked
ye, didn’ t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I—‘right here it was.’  ‘Very good,’  says he
—‘he used his ivory leg, didn’ t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I. ‘Well then,’  says he,
‘wise Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn’ t he kick with right good will? it wasn’ t a common  pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you were kicked6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

an honor .","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Listen, wise Stubb. In old England the greatest lords think it great
glory to be slapped by a queen, and made garter -knights of; but, be your boast,
Stubb, that ye were kicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remembe r
what I say; be kicked by him; account his kicks honor s; and on no account kick
back; for you can’t help yourself, wise Stubb. Don’ t you see that pyramid?’  With
that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow , in some queer fashion, to swim off
into the air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now , what
do you think of that dream, Flask?”
“I don’ t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.’”
“May be; may be. But it’s made a wise man of me, Flask. D’ye see Ahab
standing there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing you can do,
Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him, whatever he says. Halloa! What’ s that he shouts? Hark!”
“Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts! “If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him! “What do you think  of that now, Flask? ain’t there a small drop of something
queer abou t that, eh? A white whale—d id ye mark that, man? Look ye—there’ s
something special in the wind. Stand by for it, Flask. Ahab has that that’s bloody
on his mind. But, mum; he comes this way .”
CHAPTER 32. Cetology . Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in its
unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere the Pequod’ s
weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan; at the
outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough
appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and
allusions of all sorts which are to follow . It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera, that I
would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The classification of the
constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here essayed. Listen to what the best and
latest authorities have laid down. “No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled
Cetology ,” says Captain Scoresby , A.D. 1820. “It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry as to the
true meth od of dividing the cetacea into groups and families. * * * Utter
confusion exists among the historians  of this animal” (sperm whale), says
Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839. “Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.” “Impenetrable
veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.” “A field strewn with thorns.” “All
these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists.”
Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier , and John Hunter , and Lesson, those
lights of zoology and anatomy . Nevertheless, though of real knowledge there be
little, yet of books  there are a plenty; and so in some small degree, with
cetology , or the science of whales. Many are the men, small and great, old and
new, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in little, written of the whale .6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

T.,"Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Cheever . But
to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited
extracts will show . Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen ever
saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and
whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby . On the separate subject of the Greenland
or right-whale, he is the best existing authority . But Scoresby knew nothing and
says nothing of the great sperm whale , compared with which the Greenland
whale is almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland
whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the
largest of the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the
profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the then
fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present
day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this
usurpation has been every way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic
allusions in the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland
whale, without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has
at last come for a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good
people all,—the Greenland whale is deposed,—the great sperm whale now
reigneth! There are only two books in being whic h at all pretend to put the living sperm
whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree succeed in the
attempt. Those book s are Beale’ s and Bennett’ s; both in their time surgeons to
English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men. The original
matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily
small; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality , though mostly confined to
scientific descriptio n. As yet, however , the sperm whale, scientific or poetic,
lives not complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted whales, his is an
unwritten life. Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive
classification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to be filled in
all its departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man advances to take
this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing
complete; because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very
reason infallibly be faulty . I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description
of the various species, or—in this place at least—to much of any description. My object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology . I am the architect, not the builder . But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter -sorter in the Post-Of fice is equal
to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them; to have one’s hands
among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a
fearful thing. What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan ! The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a
covenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam through
libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with whales with these
visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to
settle. First: The uncertain , unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the
very vestib ule attest ed by the fact, that in some quarters it still remains a moot6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 90/353point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnæus
declares, “I hereby separate the whales from the fish.” But of my own
knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and
herring, against Linnæus’ s express edict , were still found dividing the possession
of the same seas with the Leviathan. The grounds upon which Linnæus would fain have banished the whales from
the waters, he states  as follows: “On account of their warm bilocular heart, their
lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem intrantem feminam
mammis lactantem,” and finally , “ex lege naturæ jure meritoque.” I submitted all
this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both
messmates of mine in a certain voyage , and they united in the opinion that the
reasons set forth were altogether insuf ficient. Charley profanely hinted they
were humbug. Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned ground
that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me. This fundamental
thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect does the whale differ
from other fish. Above, Linnæus has given you those items. But in brief, they
are these: lungs and warm blood; wher eas, all other fish are lungless and cold
blooded. Next: how shall we define the whal e, by his obvious externals, so as
conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a whale is a
spouting fish with a horizontal tail. There you have him. However contracted,
that defini tion is the result of expanded meditation. A walrus spouts much like a
whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of
the definit ion is still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must
have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical ,
or up-and- down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be
similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position. By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the
leviathanic brotherh ood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by
the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with it any fish
hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.* Hence, all the smaller , spouting, and
horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology . Now ,
then, come the grand divisions of the entire whale host. *I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and
Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included by
many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy ,
contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay,
and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have
presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology . First: Acco rding to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS
(subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them all, both
small and lar ge. I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCT AVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO
WHALE. As the type of the FOLIO I present the Sperm Whale ; of the OCT AVO, the
Grampus ; of the DUODECIMO, the Porpoise . FOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:—I. The Sperm
Whale ; II. the Right Whale ; III. the Fin-Back Whale ; IV. the Hump-backed
Whale ; V. the Razor Back Whale ; VI. the Sulphur Bottom Whale . BOOK I. (Folio ), CHAPTER I. (Sperm Whale ).—This whale, among the
English of old vague ly known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter whale, and6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is, without
doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of all whales to
encounter; the most majestic in aspect;  and lastly , by far the most valuable in
commerce; he being the only creature  from which that valuable substance ,
spermaceti, is obtained. All his pecul iarities will, in many other places, be
enlar ged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Philologically
considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was almost
wholly unknown in his own proper individuality , and when his oil was only
accidentally obtaine d from the stranded  fish; in those days spermaceti, it would
seem, was popularly  supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the
one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea
also, that this same  spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland
Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses. In those times ,
also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce , not being used for light, but only as an
ointment and medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you
nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of time, the
true nature of sperm aceti became known, its original name was still retained by
the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of
its scarcity . And so the appellation must  at last have come to be bestowed upon
the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived. BOOK I. (Folio ), CHAPTER II. (Right Whale ).—In one respect this is the
most vene rable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted by man. It
yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and the oil specially
known as “whale oil,” an inferior article  in commerce. Among the fishermen, he
is indiscri minately designated by all the following titles: The Whale; the
Greenland Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right
Whale. There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus
multitudinously baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in the second
species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the
Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the Baleine Ordinaire of the French
whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more
than two centuries past has been hunted  by the Dutch and English in the Arctic
seas; it is the whale which the Americ an fishermen have long pursued in the
Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor’ West Coast, and various other
parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds. Some pretend to see a difference betwee n the Greenland whale of the English
and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree in all their grand
features; nor has there yet been present ed a single determinate fact upon which
to ground a radical distinction. It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most
inconclusive differences, that some departments of natural history become so
repellingly intricate. The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length,
with reference to elucidating the sperm whale. BOOK I.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"(Folio ), CHAPT ER III. (Fin-Back ).—Under this head I reckon a
monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and Long-John ,
has been seen almos t in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet
is so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic, in the New York packet-
tracks. In the length he attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the
right whale, but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter colour , approaching to
olive. His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting ,
slanting folds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from
which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some three
or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 92/353angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if not the slightest other
part of the creature  be visible, this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly
projecting from the surface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly
marked with spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts
shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery
circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-
lines grave d on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-Back
is not gregarious. He seems a whale-ha ter, as some men are man-haters. Very
shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly  rising to the surface in the remotest and
most sulle n waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic
spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in
swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems the
banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark that style
upon his back. From  having the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes
included with the right whale, among a theoretic species denominated
Whalebone whales , that is, whales with baleen. Of these so called Whalebone
whales, there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however , are
little known. Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales;
bunched whales; under -jawed whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen’ s
names for a few sorts. In connection with this appellative of “Whalebone whales,” it is of great
importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in
facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to attempt a clear
classification of the Leviathan, founded  upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin,
or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously
seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any
other detached bodily distinctions, whic h the whale, in his kinds, presents. How
then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities
are indiscr iminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard to
what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there
the similitude ceases. Then, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland
whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is
just the same with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales,
they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of them
detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general methodization
formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has
split. But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale, in his
anatomy—there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right classification. Nay;
what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland whale’ s anatomy more
striking than his baleen? Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible
correctly to classify the Greenland whal e. And if you descend into the bowels of
the various leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as
available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated. Wha t
then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily , in their entire liberal
volume, and boldly sort them that way. And this is the Bibliographical system
here adopted; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is
practicable.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

into harbor . He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or you might call him the

smaller one. His oil is not very valuable. He has baleen. He is the most
gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white
water generally than any other of them. BOOK I. (Folio ), CHAPT ER V. (Razor Back).—Of this whale little is known
but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a retiring nature,
he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no coward, he has never yet
shown any part of him but his back, which rises in a long sharp ridge. Let him
go. I know little more of him, nor does anybody else.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

which present may be numbered:—I., the Grampus ; II., the Black Fish; III., the
Narwhale ; IV., the Thrasher ; V., the Killer . *Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain. Because, while the whales of this order , though smaller than those of the former
order , nevertheless retain a proportion ate likeness to them in figure, yet the
bookbinder ’s Quart o volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the
shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume does. BOOK II.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"(Octavo ), CHAPTER I. (Grampus ).—Though this fish, whose loud
sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to landsmen, is so
well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not popularly classed among whales. But possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalist s
have recognised him for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen
to twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the waist . He swims in herds; he is never regularly  hunted, though his oil is considerable in
quantity , and pretty good for light. By some fishermen his approach is regarded
as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale. BOOK II. (Octavo ), CHAPT ER II. (Black Fish).—I give the popular
fishermen’ s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best. Where any
name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and suggest another . I
do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called, because blackness is the rule
among almost all whales. So, call him the Hyena Whale, if you please. His
voracity is well known, and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his
lips are curved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his
face. This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in
almost all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in
swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more
profitably employed , the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena
whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment—as some
frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company , and quite alone by themselves,
burn unsav ory tallow  instead of odorous  wax. Though their blubber is very thin,
some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil. BOOK II.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his
peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The creature is some6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 94/353sixteen feet in length , while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed ten,
and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened
tusk, grow ing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner
something analogou s to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What precise
purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to say. It does not
seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some
sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom
of the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the
Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice,
thrusts his horn up, and so breaks throu gh. But you cannot prove either of these
surmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may
really be used by the Narwhale—howe ver that may be—it would certainly be
very conv enient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets. The Narwhale I have
heard called the Tusked whale, the Horn ed whale, and the Unicorn whale. He is
certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every
kingdom of animated nature. From certa in cloistered old authors I have gathered
that this same sea-unicorn’ s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great
antidote against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices . It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same way that the
horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn. Originally it was in
itself accounted an object of great curiosity . Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin
Frobisher on his return from that voyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave
her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship
sailed down the Thames; “when Sir Martin returned from that voyage,” saith
Black Letter , “on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long
horn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle at
Windsor .” An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester , on bended knees, did
likewise present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the
unicorn nature. The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a milk-white
ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black. His oil is very
superior , clear and fine; but there is little of it, and he is seldom hunted. He is
mostly found in the circumpolar seas. BOOK II.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"(Octavo ), CHAPTER IV. (Killer ).—Of this whale little is precisely
known to the Nantucketer , and nothing at all to the professed naturalist. From
what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say that he was about the bignes s
of a grampus. He is very savage—a sort of Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the
great Folio whales by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is
worried to death. The Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he
has. Excep tion migh t be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the
ground of its indis tinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on sea;
Bonapartes and Sharks included. BOOK II.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"(Octavo ), CHAPTER V. (Thrasher ).—This gentleman is famous
for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He mounts the Folio
whale’ s back, and as he swims, he work s his passage by flogging him; as some
schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process. Still less is known of
the Thrasher than of the Killer . Both are outlaws, even in the lawless seas. Thus ends BOOK II. ( Octavo ), and begins BOOK III. ( Duodecimo ). DUODECIMOES.—These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza

seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes
are infallib ly whale s, by the terms of my definition of what a whale is—i.e. a
spouting fish, with a horizontal tail. BOOK III.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"(Duodecimo ), CHAPTER 1. (Huzza Porpoise ).—This is the
common porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own
bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something must be
done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always swims in hilarious
shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in
a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their appearanc e is generally hailed with delight by the
mariner . Full of fine spirits, they invar iably come from the breezy billows to
windward. They are the lads that always live before the wind. They are
accounted a lucky omen. If you yourself  can withstand three cheers at beholding
these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is
not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of
good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid  extracted from his jaws is exceedingly
valuable.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"It is in request among jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on
their hone s. Porpoise  meat is good eating, you know . It may never have occurred
to you that a porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very
readily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him; and you
will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature. BOOK III.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"(Duodecimo ), CHAPTER II. (Algerine Porpoise ).—A  pirate. Very
savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat larger than the
Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make. Provoke him, and he will
buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many times, but never yet saw him
captured. BOOK III.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"(Duodecimo ), CHAPT ER III. (Mealy-mouthed Porpoise ).—The
largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it is known. The
only English name, by which he has hitherto been designated, is that of the
fishers—Right-Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance that he is chiefly found
in the vicinity of that Folio. In shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza
Porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and
gentleman-like figur e. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises have),
he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But his mealy-
mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable,
yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship’ s hull, called the “bright
waist,” that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate colours, black
above and white below. The white comprises part of his head, and the whole of
his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit
to a meal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of the
common porpoise. * * * * * *
Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system  does not proceed, inasmuch as the
Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the Leviathans of
note. But there are a rabble of uncertain , fugitive, half-fabulous whales, which,
as an American whaleman, I know by reputation, but not personally . I shall
enumerate them by their fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be
valuable to future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then he can
readily be incorporated into this System, according to his Folio, Octavo, or
Duodecimo magnitude:—The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale; the Pudding-
Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the
Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceber g Whale; the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

authorities, there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with
all manner of uncou th names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can
hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but
signifying nothing. Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here, and at

"The Specksnyder . Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place as any
to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising from the existence
of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of course in any other
marine than the whale-fleet. The large importanc e attached to the harpooneer ’s vocation is evinced by the
fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery , two centuries and more ago, the
command of a whal e ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the
captain, but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksnyder . Literally this word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however , in time made it equivalen t
to Chief Harpooneer . In those days, the captain’ s authority was restricted to the
navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting
department and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer reigned
supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery , under the corrupted title of
Specksioneer , this old Dutch official is still retained, but his former dignity is
sadly abrid ged. At present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is
but one of the captain’ s more inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good
conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends ,
and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat,
but under  certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground) the
command of the ship’s deck is also his; therefore the grand political maxim of
the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart from the men before the
mast, and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior; though
always, by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal. Now , the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is this—the
first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and merchantmen alike ,
the mates  have their quarters with the captain; and so, too, in most of the
American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship. That
is to say, they take their meals in the captain’ s cabin, and sleep in a place
indirectly communicating with it. Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest of
all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and the
community of interest prevailing among a company , all of whom, high or low,
depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their common luck,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 97/353together with their common vigilance, intrepidity , and hard work; though all
these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in
merchantmen generally; yet, never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian
family these whalemen may, in some primitive instances, live together; for all
that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the quarter -deck are seldom materially
relaxed, and in no instance done away . Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in
which you will see the skipper parading his quarter -deck with an elated grandeur
not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward
homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth. And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given to
that sort of shallowe st assumption; and though the only homage he ever exacted,
was implic it, instantaneous obedience; though he required no man to remove the
shoes from  his feet ere stepping upon the quarter -deck; and though there were
times when, owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to
be detailed, he addre ssed them in unusu al terms, whether of condescension or in
terrorem, or otherw ise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means unobservant of
the paramount forms and usages of the sea. Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those forms
and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally making use of
them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to
subserve. That certain sultanism of his brain, which had otherwise in a good
degree remained unmanifested; through those forms that same sultanism became
incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship. For be a man’ s intellectual superiority
what it will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over other
men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in
themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is, that for ever keeps God’ s
true princ es of the Empire from the world’ s hustings; and leaves the highes t
honors that this air can give, to those men who become famous more through
their infin ite inferio rity to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than
through their undou bted superiority over the dead level of the mass. Such large
virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest
them, that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted
potency . But when,  as in the case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of
geographical empire  encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch
abased before the tremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who
would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing, ever
forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one now alluded to. But Ahab, my Capt ain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness
and shagg iness; and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings, I must not
conceal that I have  only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like him; and,
therefore, all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me. Oh,
Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked at from the skies,
and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air! CHAPTER 34.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

from the cabin-scutt le, announces dinner to his lord and master; who, sitting in
the lee quarter -boat, has just been taking an observation of the sun; and is now6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete
inattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his
menial. But presentl y, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to
the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, “Dinner , Mr. Starbuck,”
disappears into the cabin. When the last echo of his sultan’ s step has died away , and Starbuck, the first
Emir , has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck rouses from
his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after a grave peep into the
binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness, “Dinner , Mr. Stubb,” and
descends the scuttle. The second Emir  lounges about the rigging awhile, and
then slightly shaking the main brace, to see whether it will be all right with that
important rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid “Dinner ,
Mr. Flask,” follows after his predecessors. But the third Emir , now seeing himself all alone on the quarter -deck, seems to
feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all sorts of knowing winks
in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but
noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand Turk’s head; and then, by a
dexterous sleight, pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes
down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all
other processions, by bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into the
cabin doorway below , he pauses, ships a new face altogether , and, then,
independent, hilario us little Flask enters King Ahab’ s presence, in the character
of Abjectus, or the Slave. It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of
sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck some officers will, upon
provocation, bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their
commander; yet, ten to one, let those very officers the next moment go down to
their custo mary dinner in that same commander ’s cabin, and straightway their
inoffensive, not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the
head of the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this
difference?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
A problem?,"Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar , King of Babylon;
and to have been Belshazzar , not haughtily but courteously , therein certainly
must have been some touch of mundane grandeur . But he who in the rightly
regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner -table of invited
guests, that man’ s unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for
the time; that man’ s royalty of state transcends Belshazzar ’s, for Belshazzar was
not the greatest. Who has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be
Cæsar . It is a witche ry of social czarship which there is no withstanding. Now , if
to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship-master , then,
by inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life just
mentioned. Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion on the
white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs. In his
own prope r turn, each officer waited to be served. They were as little children
before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social
arrogance. With one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man’ s
knife, as he carved the chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world
they would  have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even upon
so neutral a topic as the weather . No! And when reaching out his knife and fork,
between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck’ s
plate towards him, the mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut
it tenderly ; and a little started if, perch ance, the knife grazed against the plate;6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 99/353and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For,
like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor
profoundly dines with the seven Imper ial Electors, so these cabin meals were
somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab
forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief it was to
choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below . And poor
little Flask , he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family party . His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help himself, this must have seemed to him
tantamount to larceny in the first degre e. Had he helped himself at that table,
doubtless, never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this hones t
world; nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask
helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of
all, did Flask presum e to help himself to butter . Whether he thought the owners
of the ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear , sunny
complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless
waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern ;
however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man! Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner , and Flask is the
first man up. Consid er! For hereby Flask’ s dinner was badly jammed in point of
time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him; and yet they also have the
privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than
Flask, happens to have but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of
concluding his repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than
three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask
to the deck . Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever since
he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he had never known
what it was to be otherwise than hungry , more or less. For what he ate did not so
much relieve his hunger , as keep it immortal in him. Peace and satisfaction ,
thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach. I am an officer; but,
how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to
when I was before the mast. There’ s the fruits of promotion now; there’ s the
vanity of glory: there’ s the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any mere
sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask’ s official capacity , all
that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample vengeance, was to go aft at dinner -
time, and get a peep at Flask through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and
dumfoundered before awful Ahab. Now , Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in
the Pequod’ s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted order to their
arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was restored to some hurried
order by the pallid steward. And then the three harpooneers were bidden to the
feast, they being its residuary legatees. They made a sort of temporary servants’
hall of the high and mighty cabin. In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible
domineerings of the captain’ s table, was the entire care-free license and ease, the
almost frantic democracy of those infer ior fellows the harpooneers. While their
masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws,
the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined like lords; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading
with spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill
out the vacancies made by the previou s repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was
fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid
ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a nimble hop-skip -6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 100/353and-jump, then Tashtego had an unge ntlemanly way of accelerating him by
darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And once Daggoo, seized with a
sudden humor , assisted Dough-Boy’ s memory by snatching him up bodily , and
thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher , while Tashtego, knife in
hand, bega n laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him. He was naturally a
very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow , this bread-faced steward; the
progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. And what with the standing
spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical tumultuous visitations of
these three savages, Dough-Boy’ s whole life was one continual lip-quiver . Commonly , after seeing the harpoon eers furnished with all things they
demanded, he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining ,
and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door , till all was over . It was a sight to see Queequeg seated  over against Tashtego, opposing his
filed teeth to the Indian’ s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the floor , for a
bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low carlines; at every
motion of his coloss al limbs, making the low cabin framework to shake, as when
an African elephant goes passenger in a ship. But for all this, the great negro was
wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty . It seemed hardly possible that by
such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused
through so broad, baronial, and super b a person. But, doubtless, this noble
savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through
his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublim e life of the worlds. Not by beef or by
bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric

trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in
his own lean arms. And when he woul d hear Tashtego singing out for him to
produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the simple-witted steward all
but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry , by his sudden fits of
the palsy. Nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets,
for their lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner , they
would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at all tend
to tranqui llize poor Dough-Boy . How could he forget that in his Island days,

convivial indiscretions. Alas!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ship’ s
cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is, at
any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth, the mates and harpooneers of the
Pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it. For
when they did enter it, it was something  as a street-door enters a house; turning
inwards for a mome nt, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,
residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin was no
companionship; socially , Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally included in
the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He lived in the world, as
the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri. And as when Spring and6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

"The Mast-Head. It was during the more pleasant weather , that in due rotation with the other
seamen my first mast-head came round. In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost
simultaneously with the vessel’ s leaving her port; even though she may have
fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground . And if, after a three, four, or five years’  voyage she is drawing nigh home with
anything empty in her—say , an empty vial even—then, her mast-heads are kept
manned to the last; and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the
port, does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more. Now , as the busine ss of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very
ancient and interesti ng one, let us in some measure expatiate here. I take it, that
the earlies t standers  of mast-heads were the old Egyptians; because, in all my
researches, I find none prior to them. For though their progenitors, the builders
of Babel, must doubtless, by their tower , have intended to rear the loftiest mast -
head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that
great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the dread
gale of God’s wrath;  therefore, we canno t give these Babel builders priority over
the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is an
assertion based upon the general belief among archæologists, that the first
pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported
by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby ,
with prodi gious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were wont to
mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern
ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the
famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the
desert and spent the whole latter portio n of his life on its summit, hoisting his
food from  the ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a
dauntless stander -of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by
fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything out to the last,
literally died at his post. Of modern standers-of-mast-heads we have but a
lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and bronze men; who, though well capable of
facing out a stiff gale, are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out
upon disco vering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the
column of Vendome , stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in
the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below; whether Louis Philippe, Loui s
Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high aloft on his
towering main-mast  in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules’  pillars, his column
marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral
Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in Trafalga r
Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke, token is yet given
that a hidden hero is there; for where there is smoke, must be fire. But neither
great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single hail from6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

upon whic h they gaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate
through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must
be shunned. It may seem unwarr antable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers of
the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not so, is plainly evinced by
an item for which Obed Macy , the sole historian of Nantucket, stands
accountable. The worthy Obed tells us, that in the early times of the whale
fishery , ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of
that island erected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs
ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-
house. A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of
New Zeala nd, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned
boats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to
the one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are
kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at
the helm), and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene weather of the
tropics it is exceedi ngly pleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative
man it is delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks ,
striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you
and betwe en your legs, as it were, swim  the hugest monsters of the sea, even as
ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes. There
you stand , lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing ruffled but the
waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow;
everything resolves you into languor . For the most part, in this tropic whaling
life, a sublime unev entfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes;
extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into
unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt
securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall
have for dinner—for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed
in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable. In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years’  voyage, as
often happ ens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head would
amount to several entire months. And it is much to be deplored that the place to
which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural
life, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy
inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as
pertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any
other of those smal l and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate
themselves. Your most usual point of perch is the head of the t’ gallant-mast ,
where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen )
called the t’ gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels
about as cosy as he would standing on a bull’s horns. To be sure, in cold weather
you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a watch-coat; but
properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad
body; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely
move about in it, nor even move out of it, without running great risk of perishing
(like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat is
not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body , and no more can you
make a convenient closet of your watch-coat. Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a
southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 103/353called crow’s-nests , in which the look- outs of a Greenland whaler are protected
from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In the fireside narrative of
Captain Sleet, entitle d “A Voyage amon g the Iceber gs, in quest of the Greenland
Whale, and incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of
Old Gree nland;” in this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are
furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented
crow’s-nest  of the Glacier, whic h was the name of Captain Sleet’ s good craft. He
called it the Sleet’ s crow’s-nest , in honor of himself; he being the original
inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous false delicacy , and holding
that if we call our own children after our own names (we fathers being the
original inventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate after
ourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet’ s crow’ s-nest is
something like a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however , where it is
furnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a
hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a
little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship,
is a comfo rtable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and
coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe,
telescope, and other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood
his mast-head in this crow’ s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with
him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot, for the
purpose of popping off the stray narw hales, or vagrant sea unicorns infesting
those waters; for you cannot successfull y shoot at them from the deck owing to
the resista nce of the water , but to shoot down upon them is a very differen t
thing. Now , it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he
does, all the little detailed convenience s of his crow’ s-nest; but though he so
enlar ges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific accoun t
of his experiments in this crow’ s-nest, with a small compass he kept there for the
purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the “local
attraction” of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity
of the iron in the ship’ s planks, and in the Glacier ’s case, perhaps, to there
having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that
though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his learned
“binnacle deviation s,” “azimuth compass observations,” and “approximate
errors,” he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in
those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally
towards that well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of
his crow’ s nest, within easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly
admire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it
very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a
faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers and
hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird’ s nest
within three or four perches of the pole. But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain
Sleet and his Gree nlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is greatly counter -
balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we
South fishers mostly float. For one, I used to lounge up the rigging very
leisurely , resting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg, or any one else off
duty whom I might find there; then ascending a little way further , and throwing
a lazy leg over the top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures ,
and so at last mount to my ultimate destination. Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but sorry
guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how could I—being
left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering altitude—how could I6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

“Keep your weather eye open, and sing out every time.”
And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of
Nantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow
and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who offers to ship
with the Phædon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware of such an one, I say;
your whales must be seen before they can be killed; and this sunken-eyed young
Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world, and never make you one pint
of sperm the richer . Nor are these moni tions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the
whale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy , and absent-
minded young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking
sentiment in tar and blubber . Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himsel f
upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship, and in moody
phrase ejaculates:—
      “Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand blubber -hunters sweep over thee in vain.”
Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young
philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient “interest” in the
voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable ambition, as
that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise. But all
in vain; those young  Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they
are short-s ighted; what use, then, to strain the visual nerve? They have left their
opera-glasses at home. “Why , thou monkey ,” said a harpooneer to one of these lads, “we’ve been
cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale yet. Whales
are scarce  as hen’s teeth whenever thou art up here.” Perhaps they were; or
perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon; but lulled into
such an opium-like listlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent -
minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he
loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that
deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange ,
half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every dimly-discovered,
uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those
elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it. In
this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused
through time and space; like Cranmer ’s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at
last a part of every shore the round globe over . There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a gently
rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from the inscrutable tides
of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on ye, move your foot or hand an
inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity comes back in horror . Over
Descartian vortices you hover . And perhaps, at mid-day , in the fairest weather ,
with one half-thrott led shriek you drop through that transparent air into the
summer sea, no more to rise for ever . Heed it well, ye Pantheists!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 105/353(Enter Ahab: Then, all. )
It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning shortly
after break fast, Ahab , as was his wont, ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck . There most sea-captains usually walk at that hour, as country gentlemen, after
the same meal, take a few turns in the garden. Soon his steady , ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old rounds,
upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over dented, like
geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did you fixedly gaze, too,
upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also, you would see still stranger foot-
prints—the foot-prints of his one unsleeping, ever -pacing thought. But on the occasio n in question, those dents looked deeper , even as his
nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his thought was
Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast and now at
the binnac le, you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned, and
pace in him as he paced; so completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but
seemed the inward mould of every outer movement. “D’ye mark him, Flask?” whispered Stubb; “the chick that’s in him pecks the
shell. ’T will soon be out.”
The hours  wore on;—Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the
deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect. It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks, and
inserting his bone leg into the auger -hole there, and with one hand grasping a
shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft. “Sir!” said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship-
board except in some extraordinary case. “Send everybody aft,” repeated Ahab. “Mast-heads, there! come down!”
When the entire ship’ s company were assembled, and with curious and not
wholly unapprehens ive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike the
weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly glancing over
the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew , started from his
standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns
upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to pace,
unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously
whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose
of witnessing a pedestrian feat. But this did not last long. Vehemently pausing,
he cried:—
“What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?”
“Sing out for him!” was the impulsiv e rejoinder from a score of clubbed
voices. “Good!” cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the hearty
animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them. “And what do ye next, men?”
“Lower away , and after him!”
“And what tune is it ye pull to, men?”
“A dead whale or a stove boat!”
More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the
countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to gaze
curiously at each other , as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became
so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 106/353But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his pivot-
hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly , almost convulsively
grasping it, addressed them thus:—
“All ye mast-heade rs have before now heard me give orders about a white
whale. Look ye!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"d’ye see this Spanish  ounce of gold?”—holding up a broad
bright coin to the sun—“it is a sixtee n dollar piece, men. D’ye see it?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.”
While the mate was getting the hammer , Ahab, without speaking, was slowly
rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to heighten its lustre ,
and witho ut using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself,
producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the
mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him. Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck,  he advanced towards the main-mast
with the hammer uplifted in one hand,  exhibiting the gold with the other , and
with a high raised voice exclaiming: “Whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed
whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that
white-headed whale , with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke—look ye,
whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce ,
my boys!”
“Huzza! huzza!” cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the
act of nailing the gold to the mast. “It’s a white whale, I say,” resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul: “a
white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water; if ye see
but a bubble, sing out.”
All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even
more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the
wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately
touched by some specific recollection. “Captain Ahab,” said Tashtego, “that white whale must be the same that some
call Moby Dick.”
“Moby Dick?” shouted Ahab. “Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?”
“Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?” said the Gay-
Header deliberately . “And has he a curious spout, too,” said Daggoo, “very bushy , even for a
parmacetty , and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?”
“And he have one, two, three—oh! good many iron in him hide, too,
Captain,” cried Queequeg disjointedly , “all twiske-tee be-twisk, like him—him
—” faltering hard for a word, and screw ing his hand round and round as though
uncorking a bottle—“like him—him—”
“Corkscrew!” cried Ahab, “aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted and
wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole shock of
wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual sheep-
shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tail s like a split jib in a squall. Death and
devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen—Moby Dick—Moby Dick!”
“Captain Ahab,” said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far been
eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed struck with a
thought which somewhat explained all the wonder . “Captain Ahab, I have heard
of Moby Dick—but it was not Moby Dick that took of f thy leg?”
“Who told thee that?” cried Ahab; then pausing, “Aye, Starbuck; aye, my
hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that brought
me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,” he shouted with a terrific, loud,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

white whale that razed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a
day!” Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted out:
“Aye, aye! and I’ll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round
the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition’ s flames before I give him up. And
this is what ye have shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of
land, and over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out. What
say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do look brave.”
“Aye, aye!” shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the
excited old man: “A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for Moby
Dick!”
“God bless ye,” he seemed to half sob and half shout. “God bless ye, men.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what’ s this long face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not game for Moby Dick?”
“I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain Ahab,
if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I came here to hunt
whales, not my commander ’s vengeance. How many barrels will thy vengeance
yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our
Nantucket market.”
“Nantucket market! Hoot!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a little

fetch a great premium here!”
“He smites his chest,” whispered Stubb, “what’ s that for? methinks it rings
most vast, but hollow .”
“Vengeance on a dumb brute!” cried Starbuck, “that simply smote thee from
blindest instinct!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab,
seems blasphemous.”
“Hark ye yet again— the little lower layer. All visible objects, man, are but as

there, some unknow n but still reasonin g thing puts forth the mouldings of its
features from behind  the unreasoning mask. If man will strike, strike through the

“God keep me!—keep us all!” murmured Starbuck, lowly . But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab did not
hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the hold; nor yet the
presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor yet the hollow flap of the
sails against the masts, as for a moment their hearts sank in. For again
Starbuck’ s downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life; the
subterranean laugh died away; the wind s blew on; the sails filled out; the ship
heaved and rolled as before. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"why stay ye not
when ye come? But rather are ye predict ions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not
so much prediction s from without, as verifications of the foregoing thing s
within. For with little external to const rain us, the innermost necessities in our
being, these still drive us on. “The measure!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"the measure!” cried Ahab. Receiving the brimming pewter , and turning to the harpooneers, he ordered
them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him near the capstan,
with their harpoons in their hands, while his three mates stood at his side with
their lances, and the rest of the ship’ s company formed a circle round the group;
he stood for an insta nt searchingly eyeing every man of his crew . But those wild
eyes met his, as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their
leader , ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison; but, alas! only to
fall into the hidden snare of the Indian. “Drink and pass!” he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest
seaman. “The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short draughts—
long swall ows, men; ’tis hot as Satan’ s hoof. So, so; it goes round excellently . It
spiralizes in ye; forks out at the serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost
drained.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"That way it went, this way it comes. Hand it me—here’ s a hollow! Men,
ye seem the years; so brimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill! “Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan; and ye
mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there with your
irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some sort revive a noble
custom of my fisher man fathers before me. O men, you will yet see that—Ha!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

pewter had run brimming again, wer ’t not thou St. Vitus’ imp—away , thou ague! “Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Let me
touch the axis.” So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three level,
radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing, suddenly and nervously
twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from Starbuck to Stubb; from
Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some nameless, interior volition, he
would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within
the Leyden jar of his own magnetic life. The three mates quailed before his
strong, sustained, and mystic aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from
him; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright. “In vain!”  cried Ahab; “but, maybe, ’tis well. For did ye three but once take
the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, that had perhaps expired
from out me. Percha nce, too, it would have dropped ye dead. Perchance ye need6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

feet of beggars, using his tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own
condescension, that shall bend ye to it.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your
seizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!”
Silently obeying the order , the three harpooneers now stood with the detached
iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs up, before him. “Stab me not with that keen steel!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Cant them; cant them over! know ye not the
goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers, advance. The irons! take them;  hold them while I fill!” Forthwith, slowly going from one officer to
the other , he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter . “Now , three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow
them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha! Starbuck ! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it. Drink, ye
harpooneers! drink and swear , ye men that man the deathful whaleboat’ s bow—
Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his
death!” The long, barbed steel goblets were lifted; and to cries and maledictions
against the white whale, the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a
hiss. Starb uck paled, and turned, and shivered. Once more, and finally , the
replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when, waving his
free hand to them, they all dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin. CHAPTER 37. Sunset. The cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out . I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where’er I sail. The
envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them; but first I pass. Yonder , by ever-brimming goblet’ s rim, the warm waves blush like wine. The
gold brow  plumbs the blue. The diver sun—slow dived from noon—goes down ;
my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then, the crown too
heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy . Yet is it bright with many a
gem; I the wearer , see not its far flashings; but darkly feel that I wear that, that
dazzlingly confounds. ’Tis iron—that I know—not gold. ’Tis split, too—that I
feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against the solid metal ;
aye, steel skull, mine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering
fight! Dry heat upon my brow?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred
me, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me; all

"Moby Dick. I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest; my
oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more did I
hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A wild, mystical,
sympathetical feelin g was in me; Ahab’ s quenchless feud seemed mine. With
greedy ears I learned  the history of that murderous monster against whom I and
all the others had taken our oaths of violence and revenge. For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied, secluded
White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 115/353Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of his existence; only a few
of them, comparatively , had knowingly seen him; while the number who as yet
had actually and knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to
the large number of whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over
the entire watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their
quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or
more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any sort; the
inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity of the times of sailing
from home; all these, with other circumstances, direct and indirect, long
obstructed the spread through the whole  world-wide whaling-fleet of the special
individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted, that
several vessels reported to have encountered, at such or such a time, or on such
or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity ,
which whale, after doing great misc hief to his assailants, had completely
escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the
whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick. Yet as of late the
Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances
of great ferocity , cunning, and malice in the monster attacked; therefore it was,
that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters,
perhaps, for the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred,
more, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the
individual cause. In that way, mostly , the disastrous encounter between Ahab and
the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded. And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance
caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them,
almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered  for him, as for any other whale of that
species. But at length, such calamities did ensue in these assaults—not restricted
to sprained  wrists and ankles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations—but fatal
to the last degree of fatality; those repea ted disastrous repulses, all accumulating
and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake the
fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale had
eventually come. Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more horrify
the true histories of these deadly encou nters. For not only do fabulous rumors
naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events,—as the
smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in that of
terra firma , wild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them
to cling to. And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter , so the whale fishery
surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and fearfulness
of the rumors which  sometimes circulate there. For not only are whalemen as a
body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all
sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds the most directly brought into
contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not
only eye its greates t marvels, but, hand  to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in
such remo test wate rs, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a
thousand shores, you would not come  to any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught
hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing
too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending
to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth. No wonder , then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the
widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the end
incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and half-formed fœtal
suggestions of supernatural agencies, which eventually invested Moby Dick6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 116/353with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears. So that in many
cases such a panic did he finally strike,  that few who by those rumors, at least,
had heard of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounte r
the perils of his jaw . But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work. Not
even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale, as fearfully
distinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died out of the minds of the
whalemen as a body. There are those this day among them, who, though
intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Righ t
whale, would perhap s—either from professional inexperience, or incompetency ,
or timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are plenty
of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the
American flag, who have never hostil ely encountered the Sperm Whale, but
whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster
primitively pursued in the North; seated on their hatches, these men will hearken
with a childish fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern
whaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale
anywhere more feelingly comprehende d, than on board of those prows which
stem him. And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times
thrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists—Olassen and
Povelson—declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every
other creature in the sea, but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to
be athirst for human blood. Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier ’s, were
these or almost similar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History , the
Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks included )
are “struck with the most lively terrors,” and “often in the precipitancy of their
flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause
instantaneous death.” And however the general experiences in the fishery may
amend such reports as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to the
bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in some
vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters. So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of the
fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days of the Sperm
Whale fishery , when it was oftentime s hard to induce long practised Right
whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare; such men
protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to
chase and point lance at such an appa rition as the Sperm Whale was not for
mortal man. That to attempt it, would  be inevitably to be torn into a quick
eternity . On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may be
consulted. Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things were
ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who, chancing only
to hear of him distantly and vaguely , without the specific details of any certain
calamity , and without superstitious accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not
to flee from the battle if of fered. One of the wild sugg estions referred to, as at last coming to be linked with the
White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was the unearthly
conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had actually been encountered in
opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time. Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether
without some faint show of superstitious probability . For as the secrets of the
currents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to the most erudite6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 117/353research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface
remain, in great part, unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have
originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,
especially concerning the mystic modes whereby , after sounding to a great
depth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant
points. It is a thing well known to both Amer ican and English whale-ships, and as
well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby , that some
whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies have been
found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas. Nor is it to be
gainsaid, that in some of these instances  it has been declared that the interval of
time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days. Hence,
by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the Nor’ West
Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that
here, in the real living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old
times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said
to be a lake in which  the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still
more wonderful story of the Arethusa  fountain near Syracuse (whose waters
were belie ved to have come from the Holy Land by an under ground passage) ;
these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the
whalemen. Forced into familiarity , then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing that
after repea ted, intrep id assaults, the White Whale had escaped alive; it cannot be
much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their
superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for
immortality is but ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be
planted in his flanks , he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should
ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly
deception; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away , his
unsullied jet would once more be seen. But even stripped of these supernatural  surmisings, there was enough in the
earthly make and incontestable characte r of the monster to strike the imagination
with unwo nted powe r. For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much
distinguished him from other sperm whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out—
a peculiar snow-whi te wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent features; the tokens whereby , even in the limitless,
uncharted seas, he revealed his identity , at a long distance, to those who knew
him. The rest of his body  was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the same
shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive appellation of the
White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by his vivid aspect, when seen
gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of
creamy foam, all spangled with golden gleamings. Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his
deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror , as that
unexampled, intellig ent malignity which, according to specific accounts, he had
over and over again evinced in his assaults. More than all, his treacherou s
retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else. For, when swimming
before his exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had
several times been known to turn round suddenly , and, bearing down upon them ,
either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their
ship.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 118/353Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar disasters,
however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in the fishery; yet, in
most instances, such seemed the White Whale’ s infernal aforethought of
ferocity , that every dismembering or death that he caused, was not wholly
regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent. Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed , distracted fury the minds of his more
desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed boats, and the
sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the white curds of the whale’ s
direful wrath into the serene, exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a
birth or a bridal. His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the
eddies; one captain,  seizing the line-kni fe from his broken prow , had dashed at
the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking with a six inch
blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale. That captain was Ahab. And
then it was, that suddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him,
Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab’ s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the
field. No turbaned Turk, no hired Veneti an or Malay , could have smote him with
more seem ing malice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that
almost fatal encounter , Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the
whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to
identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and
spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac
incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in
them, till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung. That intangible
malignity which has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even the
modern Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of
the east reverenced in their statue devil;—Ahab did not fall down and worship it
like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he
pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most maddens and torments; all
that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the
sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle  demonisms of life and thought; all evil,
to crazy Ahab, were  visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby
Dick. He piled upon the whale’ s white hump the sum of all the general rage and
hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a
mortar , he burst his hot heart’ s shell upon it. It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise
time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the monster , knife in
hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal animosity; and
when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing
bodily laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this collision forced to turn
towards home, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay
stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary , howling
Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one
another; and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on the
homeward voyage, after the encounter , that the final monomania seized him,
seems all but certain  from the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a
raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked
in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium, that his
mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his
hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And,
when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun’ sails
spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man’ s
delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 119/353from his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he bore that
firm, colle cted front , however pale, and issued his calm orders once again; and
his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in
his hidden self, raved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most
feline thing. When you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into
some still subtler form. Ahab’ s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly
contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows
narrowly , but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-
flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab’ s broad madness had been left behind;
so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished . That befor e living agent, now became the living instrument. If such a furious
trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity , and carried it, and
turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having
lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold more
potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object. This is much; yet Ahab’ s larger, darker , deeper part remains unhinted. But
vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding far down
from within the very heart of this spiked  Hotel de Cluny where we here stand—
however grand and wonderful, now quit it;—and take your way, ye nobler ,
sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes; where far beneath the
fantastic towers of man’ s upper earth, his root of grandeur , his whole awful
essence sits in bearded state; an antique buried beneath antiquities, and throned
on torsoes! So with a broken throne, the great gods mock that captive king; so
like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled
entablatures of ages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder , sadder souls! question that
proud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled
royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old State-secret come. Now , in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means are
sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or change, or
shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble; in some
sort, did still.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"But that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his
perceptibility , not to his will determinate. Nevertheless, so well did he succeed
in that dissembling, that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no
Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the
quick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him. The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed
to a kindred cause . And so too, all the added moodiness which alway s
afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage, sat
brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely , that far from distrusting his
fitness for another whaling voyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the
calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that
for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a
pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within
and scorc hed without, with the infixed , unrelenting fangs of some incurable
idea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart his iron
and lift his lance against the most appa lling of all brutes. Or, if for any reason
thought to be corporeally incapacitated  for that, yet such an one would seem
superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack. But be
all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad secret of his unabated rage
bolted up and keyed  in him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage
with the one only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had
any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking
in him then, how soon would their aghas t and righteous souls have wrenched the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

to be counted down in dollars from the mint. He was intent on an audacious ,
immitigable, and supernatural revenge. Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a
Job’s whale round the world, at the head of a crew , too, chiefly made up of
mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals—morally enfeebled also, by
the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck, the
invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb, and the pervading
mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew , so officered, seemed specially picked and
packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge. How it
was that they so aboundingly respond ed to the old man’ s ire—by what evil
magic their souls were possessed, that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the
White Whale as much their insuf ferable foe as his; how all this came to be—
what the White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings,
also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding great
demon of the seas of life,—all this to explain, would be to dive deeper than
Ishmael can go. The subterranean mine r that works in us all, how can one tell
whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who
does not feel the irresistible arm drag?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can
stand still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the
place; but while yet all a-rush to encou nter the whale, could see naught in that
brute but the deadliest ill. CHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of
the Whale. What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was to
me, as yet remains unsaid. Aside from  those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which
could not but occasionally awaken in any man’ s soul some alarm, there was
another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at
times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical
and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of putting it in a
comprehensible form . It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things
appalled me. But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim,
random way , explain myself I must, else all these chapters might be naught. Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty , as if
imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas, and pearls;
and thoug h various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal
preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing the
title “Lord of the White Elephants” above all their other magniloquent
ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same
snow-white quadrup ed in the royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing
the one figure of a snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire ,
Cæsarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the imperial colour the same
imperial hue; and though this pre-emine nce in it applies to the human race itself,
giving the white man ideal mastership  over every dusky tribe; and though,
besides, all this, whiteness has been even made significant of gladness, for6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 121/353among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and though in other
mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many
touching, noble things—the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though
among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the
deepest pledge of honor; though in many climes, whiteness typifies the majesty
of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and contributes to the daily state of kings
and queens drawn by milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of
the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness
and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame being held
the holiest  on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself being
made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the
midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White  Dog was by far the holiest festival of
their theology , that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they
could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and
though directly from  the Latin word for white, all Christian priests derive the
name of one part of their sacred vestu re, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the
cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith, white is
specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord; though in the
Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and the four-and-
twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great white throne, and the Holy
One that sitteth there  white like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations ,
with what ever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive
something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the
soul than that redness which af frights in blood. This elusi ve quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when
divorced from more kindly associations , and coupled with any object terrible in
itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds. Witness the white bear of the
poles, and the white shark of the tropics ; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness
makes them the transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which
imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the
dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic
coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark.*
*With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who would
fain go still deeper  into this matter , that it is not the whiteness, separately
regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute; for,
analysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, only rises from the
circumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested
in the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together
two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us with so
unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true; yet, were it not for the
whiteness, you would not have that intensified terror . As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature,
when behe ld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the same quality in the
Polar quad ruped. This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in the name
they bestow upon that fish. The Romish mass for the dead begins with “Requiem
eternam” (eternal rest), whence Requiem  denomina ting the mass itself, and any
other funeral music. Now , in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this
shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him Requin . Bethink thee of the albatross, when ce come those clouds of spiritual
wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all
imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God’ s great, unflattering
laureate, Nature.*6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 122/353*I rememb er the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged gale, in
waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch below , I ascended
to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a regal ,
feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime . At intervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy
ark. Wondrous flutterings and throbbing s shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it
uttered cries, as some king’ s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its
inexpressible, strang e eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of
God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so
white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the
miserable warping memories of traditio ns and of towns. Long I gazed at that
prodigy of plumage . I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that darted through
me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A
goney , he replied. Goney! never had heard that name before; is it conceivable
that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time
after, I learned that goney was some seaman’ s name for albatross. So that by no
possibility could Coleridge’ s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those
mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon our deck. For
neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in
saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the
poem and the poet. I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks
the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this, that by a solecism of
terms there are birds called grey albatr osses; and these I have frequently seen,
but never with such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl. But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will tell; with
a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea. At last the Captain
made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern tally round its neck, with the
ship’ s time and place; and then letting it escape. But I doubt not, that leathern
tally, meant for man, was taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join
the wing-folding, the invoking, and adoring cherubim! Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the White
Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger, large-eyed, small-
headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty,
overscorning carriag e. He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses,
whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the
Alleghanies. At their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star
which every evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his
mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more
resplendent than gold and silver -beaters could have furnished him. A most
imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western world, which to
the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval
times when Adam walked majestic as a god, bluff-browed and fearless as this
mighty steed. Whet her marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of
countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or
whether with his circumambient subject s browsing all around at the horizon, the
White Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through
his cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the
bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor can it be
questioned from what stands on legenda ry record of this noble horse, that it was
his spiritual whiteness chiefly , which so clothed him with divineness; and that
this divineness had that in it which, though commanding worship, at the same
time enforced a certain nameless terror .6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 123/353But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and
strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and Albatross. What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the
eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is that whiteness
which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he bears. The Albino is as well
made as other men— has no substantive deformity—and yet this mere aspect of
all-pervading white ness makes him more strangely hideous than the uglies t
abortion. Why should this be so?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not the less
malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the
terrible. From its snowy aspect, the gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has
been deno minated the White Squall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the art
of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary . How wildly it heightens the
effect of that passag e in Froissart, when , masked in the snowy symbol of their
faction, the desperat e White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailif f in the market -
place! Nor, in some things , does the common, hereditary experience of all mankind
fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It cannot well be doubted ,
that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer ,
is the marble pallor lingering there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the
badge of consternat ion in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here. And
from that pallor of the dead, we borro w the expressive hue of the shroud in
which we wrap them . Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same
snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in a milk-white fog—Y ea,
while these terrors seize us, let us add, that even the king of terrors, when
personified by the evangelist, rides on his pallid horse. Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he
will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance
it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul. But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to account
for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by the citation of
some of those insta nces wherein this thing of whiteness—though for the time
either wholly or in great part stripped  of all direct associations calculated to
impart to it aught fearful, but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same
sorcery , however modified;—can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue
to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek? Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety , and without
imagination no man can follow another  into these halls. And though, doubtless,
some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have
been share d by most men, yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at
the time, and therefore may not be able to recall them now . Why to the man of untutored ideality , who happens to be but loosely
acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare mention of
Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary , speechless processions of
slow-pacing pilgrim s, down-cast and hooded with new-fallen snow? Or, to the
unread, unsophistica ted Protestant of the Middle American States, why does the
passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue
in the soul? Or what is there apart from the traditio ns of dungeoned warriors and kings
(which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower of London
tell so much more strongly on the imag ination of an untravelled American, than
those other storied structures, its neigh bors—the Byward Tower , or even the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

whence, in peculiar moods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the
bare mention of that name, while the thought of Virginia’ s Blue Ridge is full of a
soft, dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes and
longitudes, does the name of the White  Sea exert such a spectralness over the
fancy , while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long
lacquered mild afternoons on the waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet
sleepiest of sunsets? Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely
addressed to the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe,
does “the tall pale man” of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor
unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves—why is this phantom more
terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksbur g? Nor is it, altogether , the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling earthquakes;
nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the tearlessness of arid skies that
never rain; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires, wrenched cope -
stones, and crosses all adroop (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her
suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon each other , as a tossed pack of
cards;—it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the strangest ,
saddest city thou can’st see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and there is a
higher horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps
her ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay ;
spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its
own distortions. I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness is
not confessed to be the prime agent  in exaggerating the terror of objects
otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginat ive mind is there aught of terror in those
appearances whose awfulness to anothe r mind almost solely consists in this one
phenomenon, espec ially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to
muteness or universality . What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be
respectively elucidated by the following examples. First: The mariner , when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by night
he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels just enough of
trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under precisely similar circumstances ,
let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnigh t
sea of milky whitene ss—as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white
bears were  swimmin g round him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the
shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in
vain the lead assure s him he is still off soundings; heart and helm they both go
down; he never rests till blue water is under him again. Yet where is the mariner
who will tell thee, “Sir, it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks, as
the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me?”
Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the snow-
howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the mere fancying
of the eternal frosted  desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes, and the natural
conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman
solitudes. Much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the West, who with
comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow ,
no shadow  of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the
sailor , beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some
infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and half
shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery , view s
what seem s a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice
monuments and splintered crosses.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo, Ishmael. Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of
Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey—why is it that upon the sunniest
day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that he cannot even see
it, but only smells its wild animal musk iness—why will he start, snort, and with
bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensi es of affright? There is no remembrance
in him of any gorings of wild creatures  in his green northern home, so that the
strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the
experience of former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt, of the
black bisons of distant Oregon? No: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the
knowledge of the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from
Oregon, still when he smells that savag e musk, the rending, goring bison herds
are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies, which this instant they
may be trampling into dust. Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of the
festooned frosts of mountains; the desol ate shiftings of the windrowed snows of
prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the
frightened colt! Though neither know s where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign
gives forth  such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere those thing s
must exist . Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in
love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright. But not yet have we solved the incantati on of this whiteness, and learned why
it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange and far more portentous
—why , as we have  seen, it is at once  the most meaning symbol of spiritual
things, nay, the very veil of the Christian’ s Deity; and yet should be as it is, the
intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind. Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and
immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of
annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way? Or is it, that as
in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour;
and at the same time the concrete of all colours; is it for these reasons that there
is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows—a
colourless, all-colou r of atheism from which we shrink? And when we conside r
that other theory of the natural philosop hers, that all other earthly hues—every
stately or lovely emblazoning—the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea,
and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of young girls; all
these are but subtile  deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but only laid on
from without; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose
allurements cover nothing but the charn el-house within; and when we proceed
further , and consider  that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her
hues, the great princ iple of light, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and
if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips
and roses, with its own blank tinge—pondering all this, the palsied universe lies
before us a leper; and like wilful travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear
coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes
himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around
him. And of all these  things the Albino whale was the symbol.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

"“HIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”
It was the middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in a
cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to the scuttle -
butt near the taffrail. In this manner , they passed the buckets to fill the scuttle-
butt. Standing, for the most part, on the hallowed precincts of the quarter -deck,
they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet. From hand to hand, the
buckets went in the deepest silence, only broken by the occasional flap of a sail,
and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel. It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy , one of the cordon, whose post
was near the after -hatches, whispered to his neighbor , a Cholo, the words above. “Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”
“Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d’ye mean?”
“There it is again— under the hatches—don’ t you hear it—a cough—it
sounded like a cough.”
“Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.”
“There again—there it is!—it sounds like two or three sleepers turning over,
now!”
“Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? It’s the three soaked biscuits ye eat
for supper turning over inside of ye—nothing else. Look to the bucket!”
“Say what ye will, shipmate; I’ve sharp ears.”
“Aye, you are the chap, ain’t ye, that heard the hum of the old Quakeress’ s
knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket; you’re the chap.”
“Grin away; we’ll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is somebody
down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I suspect our old
Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell Flask, one morning watch ,
that there was something of that sort in the wind.”
“Tish! the bucket!”
CHAPTER 44. The Chart. Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took
place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew ,
you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom, and bringing out a large
wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts, spread them before him on his screwed-
down table. Then seating himself before it, you would have seen him intently
study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but
steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank. At
intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein were set
down the seasons and places in which , on various former voyages of various
ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 127/353While thus employed, the heavy pewte r lamp suspended in chains over his
head, continually rocked with the motio n of the ship, and for ever threw shifting
gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow , till it almost seemed that
while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts,
some invis ible penci l was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked
chart of his forehead. But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his cabin, Ahab
thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were brought out; almost
every night some pencil marks were effaced, and others were substituted. For
with the charts of all four oceans before him, Ahab was threading a maze of
currents and eddies, with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that
monomaniac thought of his soul. Now , to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans, it might
seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the
unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem to Ahab, who knew the
sets of all tides and currents; and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm
whale’ s food; and, also, calling to mind the regular , ascertained seasons for
hunting him in particular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost
approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that
ground in search of his prey . So assure d, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm
whale’ s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that, could he be
closely observed and studied throughout the world; were the logs for one voyage
of the entire whale fleet carefully collated, then the migrations of the sperm
whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring-
shoals or the flights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made to
construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*
     *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne
     out by an of ficial circular , issued by Lieutenant Maury , of
     the National Observatory , Washington, April 16th, 1851. By
     that circular , it appears that precisely such a chart is in
     course of completion; and portions of it are presented in
     the circular . “This chart divides the ocean into districts
     of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude;
     perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve
     columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each
     of which districts are three lines; one to show the number
     of days that have been spent in each month in every
     district, and the two others to show the number of days in
     which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.”
 
Besides, when making a passage from  one feeding-ground to another , the
sperm whales, guided by some infallible  instinct—say , rather , secret intelligence
from the Deity—mostly swim in veins , as they are called; continuing their way
along a given ocean-line with such undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever
sailed her course, by any chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision . Though, in these cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a
surveyor ’s parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own
unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary vein in which at these times he is
said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width (more or less, as the
vein is presumed to expand or contrac t); but never exceeds the visual sweep
from the whale-ship ’s mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 128/353zone. The sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that
path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for . And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate feeding-
grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing the widest
expanses of water between those ground s he could, by his art, so place and time
himself on his way , as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting. There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious
but still methodical  scheme.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"But not so in the reality , perhaps. Though the
gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds, yet in
general you cannot  conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a
latitude or longitude  this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with
those that were found there the precedin g season; though there are peculiar and
unquestionable insta nces where the contrary of this has proved true. In general ,
the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries and
hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby Dick had
in a former year been seen, for example , on what is called the Seychelle ground
in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow ,
that were the Pequod to visit eithe r of those spots at any subsequent
corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there. So, too, with
some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed himself. But all
these seem ed only his casual stopping- places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not
his places of prolon ged abode. And where Ahab’ s chances of accomplishing his
object have hitherto  been spoken of, allusion has only been made to whateve r
way-side, anteceden t, extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time or place
were attained, when all possibilities would become probabilities, and, as Ahab
fondly thought, every possibility the next thing to a certainty . That particular set
time and place were  conjoined in the one technical phrase—the Season-on-the -
Line. For there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been
periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun, in its
annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There
it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken
place; there the waves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot
where the monoman iac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance . But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which
Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he would not permit
himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned ,
however flattering it might be to those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow
could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest. Now , the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the
Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeav or then could enable her commander to
make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running down
sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there . Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the premature hour of
the Pequod’ s sailing had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view
to this very complexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and
sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead of
impatiently endurin g ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by
chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his
periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian
Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his
race. So that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor’-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind
but the Levanter and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag
world-circle of the Pequod’ s circumnavigating wake.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 129/353But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly , seems it not but a
mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary whale, even if
encountered, should be thought capable of individual recognition from his
hunter , even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of
Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his
snow-white hump, could not but be unmistakable. And have I not tallied the
whale, Ahab would  mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long
after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries—tallied him, and shall
he escape? His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep’ s ear! And here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness and
faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air of the deck he would
seek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man
endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps with
clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms. Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid
dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through the day,
carried them on amid a clashing of phren sies, and whirled them round and round
and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing of his life-spot became
insuf ferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throe s
in him heaved his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him,
from which forked flames and lightning s shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned
him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a
wild cry would be heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would
burst from  his state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet
these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some laten t
weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its
intensity . For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfas t
hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock, was not the
agent that so caused him to burst from  it in horror again. The latter was the
eternal, living principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time
dissociated from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for
its outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneo usly sought escape from the scorching
contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an
integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul, therefore it
must have been that, in Ahab’ s case, yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to
his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will,
forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent
being of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to
which it was conjoi ned, fled horror -stricken from the unbidden and unfathered
birth. Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when what
seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated thing, a
formless somnambu listic being, a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an
object to colour , and therefore a blankne ss in itself. God help thee, old man, thy
thoughts have creat ed a creature in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus
makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that vulture
the very creature he creates.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 130/353So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed, as
indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the
habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter , in its earlier part, is as important a
one as will be found in this volume; but the leading matter of it requires to be
still furth er and more familiarly enlar ged upon, in order to be adequately
understood, and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound
ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natura l
verity of the main points of this af fair. I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be content to
produce the desired impression by separate citations of items, practically or
reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from these citations, I take it—the
conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself. First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after receiving a
harpoon, has effecte d a complete escap e; and, after an interval (in one instance
of three years), has been again struck by the same hand, and slain; when the two
irons, both marked by the same private cypher , have been taken from the body . In the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two
harpoons; and I think it may have been something more than that; the man who
darted them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to
Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party , and penetrated far into the
interior , where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by
serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils
incident to wanderin g in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he
had struc k must also have been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice
circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but
to no purpose. This man and this whale again came together , and the one
vanquished the other . I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this;
that is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second attack, saw
the two irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the
dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both
times, first and last, and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of
huge mole under the whale’ s eye, which I had observed there three years
previous. I say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are
three insta nces, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard of
many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good
ground to impeach. Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm  Whale Fishery , however ignorant the
world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable historical
instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and
places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became thus marked was not
altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from
other whales; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be,
they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down
into a peculiarly valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal
experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness abou t
such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most
fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins
when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to
cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some poor devils ashore that
happen to know an irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive
salutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued the acquaintance further , they
might receive a summary thump for their presumption.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 131/353But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebrity
—Nay , you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he famous in life
and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death, but he was admitted into all
the rights, privileges, and distinctions of a name; had as much a name indeed as
Cambyses or Cæsar . Was it not so, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred
like an iceber g, who so long did’st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name,
whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O
New Zealand Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the
vicinity of the Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan, whose
lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against
the sky? Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old
tortoise with mystic  hieroglyphics upon the back! In plain prose, here are four
whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to
the classic scholar . But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various times
creating great havoc  among the boats of different vessels, were finally gone in
quest of, systemati cally hunted out, chased and killed by valiant whaling
captains, who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view ,
as in setting out through the Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in
his mind to capture  that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost
warrior of the Indian King Philip. I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make mention
of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in printed form
establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the White
Whale, more especially the catastrophe . For this is one of those disheartening
instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error . So ignorant are
most lands men of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world,
that without some hints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the
fishery , they might scout at Moby Dick  as a monstrous fable, or still worse and
more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory . First: Thou gh most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of
the grand fishery , yet they have nothing  like a fixed, vivid conception of those
perils, and the frequency with which they recur . One reason perhaps is, that not
one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery , ever
finds a public record at home, however transient and immediately forgotten that
record. Do you suppose that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps
caught by the whale -line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to
the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan—do you suppose that that poor
fellow’ s name will appear in the newspa per obituary you will read to-morrow at
your break fast? No: because the mails are very irregular between here and New
Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or
indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you that upon one particular voyage which
I made to the Pacific, among many others we spoke thirty different ships, every
one of which had had a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three
that had each lost a boat’ s crew . For God’ s sake, be economical with your lamps
and candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man’ s blood was
spilled for it. Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an
enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that when
narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness, they
have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I declare
upon my soul, I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses, when he wrote
the history of the plagues of Egypt.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 132/353But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon
testimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm Whale
is in some  cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously malicious, as
with direc t aforetho ught to stave in, utterly destroy , and sink a large ship; and
what is more, the Sperm Whale has done it. First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex , Captain Pollard, of Nantucket, was
cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her boats, and
gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of the whales were
wounded; when, suddenly , a very large whale escaping from the boats, issued
from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the ship. Dashing his forehead
against her hull, he so stove her in, that in less than “ten minutes” she settled
down and fell over. Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since. After the
severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in their boats. Being
returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in
command of another ship, but the gods  shipwrecked him again upon unknown
rocks and breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith
forswearing the sea, he has never tempte d it since. At this day Captain Pollard is
a resident of Nantucket. I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the
Essex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I
have conversed with his son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the
catastrophe.*
*The follo wing are extracts from Chac e’s narrative: “Every fact seemed to
warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his
operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at a short interval
between them, both of which, according to their direction, were calculated to do
us the most injury , by being made ahead , and thereby combining the speed of the
two objects for the shock; to effect whic h, the exact manœuvres which he made
were necessary . His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated resentmen t
and fury. He came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered, and
in which we had struck three of his companions, as if fired with revenge for their
sufferings.” Again: “At all events, the whole circumstances taken together , all
happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in my
mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many of which
impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in
my opinion.”
Here are his reflectio ns some time after quitting the ship, during a black night
in an open  boat, when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore. “The
dark ocean  and swelling waters were nothing; the fears of being swallowed up
by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon hidden rocks, with all the other
ordinary subjects of fearful contemp lation, seemed scarcely entitled to a
moment’ s thought; the dismal looking wreck, and the horrid  aspect and revenge
of the whale , wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its
appearance.”
In another place—p. 45,—he speaks of “the mysterious and mortal attack of
the animal .”
Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807 totally lost
off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe
I have never chanced to encounter , though from the whale hunters I have now
and then heard casual allusions to it. Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J——, then
commanding an American sloop-of-war  of the first class, happened to be dining
with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in the harbor of
Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales, the Commodore6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 133/353was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by
the profes sional gentlemen present. He peremptorily denied for example, that
any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much
as a thimbleful. Very good; but there is more coming. Some weeks after, the
Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped
on the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments’  confidential
business with him. That business consi sted in fetching the Commodore’ s craft
such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made straight for the neares t
port to heave down and repair . I am not superstitious, but I consider the
Commodore’ s interv iew with that whale as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus
converted from unbelief by a similar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale will
stand no nonsense. I will now refer you to Langsdorf f’s Voyages for a little circumstance in point,
peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorf f, you must know by the
way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern’ s famous Discovery
Expedition in the beginning of the present century . Captain Langsdorf f thus
begins his seventeenth chapter:
“By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day we
were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was very clear
and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur
clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was not till the nineteenth
that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up. An uncommon large whale, the
body of which was larger than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the
water , but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship,
which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent
its striking against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger , as
this gigantic creature, setting up its back , raised the ship three feet at least out of
the water . The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether , while we who were
below all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck upon
some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity
and solem nity. Captain D’W olf applied immediately to the pumps to examine
whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock, but we found
that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.”
Now , the Captain D’W olf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question,
is a New Englander , who, after a long life of unusual adventures as a sea-
captain, this day resides in the village of Dorchester near Boston. I have the
honor of being a nephew of his.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"I have particularly questioned him concerning
this passage in Lang sdorf f. He substantiates every word. The ship, however , was
by no means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast, and
purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from
home. In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too, of
honest wonders—the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient Dampier ’s old
chums—I found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from Langsdorf f,
that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example, if such be
needed. Lionel, it seems, was on his way to “John Ferdinando,” as he calls the modern
Juan Fernandes. “In our way thither ,” he says, “about four o’clock in the
morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the Main of
America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our men in such consternation
that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think; but every one began
to prepare for death . And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we
took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazemen t6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 134/353was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * * * * *
The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages, and severa l
of the men were shaken out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his
head on a gun, was thrown out of his cabin!” Lionel then goes on to impute the
shock to an earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that
a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great mischief
along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the darkness of that
early hour of the morning, the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale
vertically bumping the hull from beneath. I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to
me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more than one
instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing boats back to their
ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long withstand all the lances hurled at
him from its decks. The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head ;
and, as for his stren gth, let me say, that there have been examples where the
lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the
ship, and secured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water , as a
horse walk s off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm
whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with blind
rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs  of destruction to his pursuers; nor is it
without conveying some eloquent indication of his character , that upon being
attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion
for several consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more and a
concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you
will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in this book
corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that these marvels (like all
marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we say
amen with Solomon—V erily there is nothing new under the sun. In the sixth Christ ian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate of
Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius general. As many know , he wrote the history of his own times, a work every way of
uncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been considered a most
trustworthy and unexaggerating historia n, except in some one or two particulars ,
not at all af fecting the matter presently to be mentioned. Now , in this history  of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term of his
prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the
neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marm ora, after having destroyed vessels at
intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years. A fact thus set
down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is there any reason it
should be. Of what precise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But
as he destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale;
and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a
long time I fancied  that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the
Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am certain
that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of
things, a place for his habitual gregarious resort. But further investigations have
recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated instances of
the presen ce of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good
authority , that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy
found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now , as a vessel of war readily passes
through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out
of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 135/353In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance called
brit is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have every reason to
believe that the food of the sperm whale—squid or cuttle-fish—lurks at the
bottom of that sea, because large creatures, but by no means the largest of that
sort, have been found at its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements
together , and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to
all human reasoning, Procopius’ s sea-monster , that for half a century stove the
ships of a Roman Emperor , must in all probability have been a sperm whale. CHAPTER 46.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Surmises. Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his thoughts
and action s ever had in view the ultim ate capture of Moby Dick; though he
seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion; nevertheless it
may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a
fiery whal eman’ s ways, altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the
voyage. Or at least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives
much more influent ial with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even
considering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White
Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales,
and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the
chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated
one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there were
still additi onal considerations which, though not so strictly according with the
wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him. To accom plish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in the
shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order . He knew , for
example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over
Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more
than mere  corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership; for to the
purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation . Starbuck’ s body and Starbuck’ s coerced will were Ahab’ s, so long as Ahab kept
his magnet at Starbu ck’s brain; still he knew that for all this the chief mate, in
his soul, abhorred his captain’ s quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate
himself from it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would elapse
ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck would ever be
apt to fall into open  relapses of rebellio n against his captain’ s leadership, unles s
some ordinary, prudential, circumstantia l influences were brought to bear upon
him. Not only that, but the subtle insan ity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was
noways more significantly manifeste d than in his superlative sense and
shrewdness in foreseeing that, for the present, the hunt should in some way be
stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that
the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure
background (for few men’ s courage is proof against protracted meditation
unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night watches, his officers
and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick. For however
eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his
quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are more  or less capricious and unreliable—they
live in the varying outer weather , and they inhale its fickleness—and when6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 136/353retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of
life and passion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary interests
and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the
final dash. Nor was Ahab unmindful of another  thing. In times of strong emotion
mankind disdain all base consideration s; but such times are evanescent. The
permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought Ahab, is
sordidness. Granting  that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my
savage crew , and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generou s
knight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it they give chase to Moby
Dick, they must also have food for their more common, daily appetites. For even
the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse
two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing
burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way. Had
they been  strictly held to their one final and romantic object—that final and
romantic object, too many would have  turned from in disgust. I will not strip
these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of cash—aye, cash. They may scorn cash
now; but let some months go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and
then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash
would soon cashier Ahab. Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to
Ahab personally . Having impulsively , it is probable, and perhaps somewha t
prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod’ s voyage,
Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he had indirectly laid himself
open to the unanswe rable charge of usurpation; and with perfect impunity , both
moral and legal, his crew if so disposed , and to that end competent, could refuse
all further obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. From even the barely hinted imputa tion of usurpation, and the possible
consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must of
course have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection could only
consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand, backed by a heedful,
closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was
possible for his crew to be subjected to. For all these reasons then, and others  perhaps too analytic to be verbally
developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue
true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod’ s voyage; observe all
customary usages; and not only that, but force himself to evince all his well
known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession. Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three mast-
heads and admonish ing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit reporting
even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

"The Mat-Maker . It was a cloudy , sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging about the
decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters. Queequeg and I
were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat, for an additiona l
lashing to our boat. So still and subdued  and yet somehow preluding was all the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 137/353scene, and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air, that each silent sailor
seemed resolved into his own invisible self. I was the attendant or page of Queequ eg, while busy at the mat. As I kept
passing and repassin g the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of
the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as Queequeg, standing
sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy  oaken sword between the threads, and
idly looking off upon the water , carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every
yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all
over the sea, only broken by the interm itting dull sound of the sword, that it
seemed as if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle
mechanically weavi ng and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed
threads of the warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging
vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise
interblending of other threads with its own. This warp seemed necessity; and
here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own
destiny into these unalterable thread s. Meantime, Queequeg’ s impulsive,
indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof slantingly , or crookedly , or
strongly , or weakly , as the case might be; and by this difference in the
concluding blow producing a correspon ding contrast in the final aspect of the
completed fabric; this savage’ s sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and
fashions both warp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance—aye ,
chance, free will, and necessity—no wise incompatible—all interweavingly
working together . The straight warp of necessity , not to be swerved from its
ultimate course—its  every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that;
free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and chance, though
restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity , and sideways in its
motions directed by free will, though thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns
rules either , and has the last featuring blow at events. Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so
strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly , that the ball of free will
dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice
dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad Gay-Header ,
Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly forward, his hand stretched out like a
wand, and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same
sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from
hundreds of whalemen’ s look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of
those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous
cadence as from Tashtego the Indian’ s. As he stood hoverin g over you half suspended in air, so wildly and eagerly
peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some prophet or seer
beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries announcing their
coming. “There she blows! there!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"there! there! she blows! she blows!”
“Where-away?”
“On the lee-beam, about two miles of f! a school of them!”
Instantly all was commotion. The Sperm  Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and
reliable uniformity . And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes
of his genus. “There go flukes!” was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales
disappeared. “Quick, steward!” cried Ahab. “T ime! time!”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 138/353Dough-Boy hurried below , glanced at the watch, and reported the exact
minute to Ahab. The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling
before it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward,
we confid ently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows. For
that singul ar craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when, sounding with his
head in one directi on, he nevertheless, while concealed beneath the surface ,
mills round, and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter—this deceitfulness of
his could not now be in action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish
seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our
vicinity . One of the men selected for shipkeepers—that is, those not appointed to
the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head. The sailors at
the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their places; the
cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three boats swung over
the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their
eager crews with one hand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly
poised on the gunw ale. So look the long line of man-of-war ’s men about to
throw themselves on board an enemy’ s ship. But at this critical instant a sudden excla mation was heard that took every eye
from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was surrounded by five
dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air . CHAPTER 48. The First
Lowering. The phantoms, for so they then seemed , were flitting on the other side of the
deck, and, with a noiseless celerity , were casting loose the tackles and bands of
the boat which swun g there. This boat had always been deemed one of the spare
boats, though techni cally called the captain’s, on account of its hanging from the
starboard quarter . The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with
one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"A rumpled Chinese
jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers of the
same dark stuff. But strangely crownin g this ebonness was a glistening white
plaited turban, the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head . Less swart in aspec t, the companions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-
yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;—
a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty , and by some honest white
mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the
water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose to be
elsewhere. While yet the wondering ship’ s compa ny were gazing upon these strangers,
Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head, “All ready there,
Fedallah?”
“Ready ,” was the half-hissed reply . “Lower away then; d’ye hear?” shouting across the deck. “Lower away there,
I say.”
Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men
sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a wallow , the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 139/353three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous, off-handed daring ,
unknown in any other vocation, the sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling
ship’ s side into the tossed boats below . Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship’ s lee, when a fourth keel,
coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and showed the
five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern, loudly hailed
Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely , so as to cover a large
expanse of water . But with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah
and his crew , the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command. “Captain Ahab?—” said Starbuck. “Spread yourselves,” cried Ahab; “give way, all four boats. Thou, Flask, pull
out more to leeward!”
“Aye, aye, sir,” cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his great
steering oar. “Lay back!” addressing his crew . “There!—there!—there again! There she blows right ahead, boys!—lay back!”
“Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy .”
“Oh, I don’t mind ’em, sir,” said Archy; “I knew it all before now. Didn’ t I
hear ’em in the hold? And didn’ t I tell Cabaco here of it? What say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr . Flask.”
“Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little ones,”
drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb  to his crew , some of whom still showed
signs of uneasiness. “Why don’t you break your backbones, my boys? What is it
you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They are only five more hand s
come to help us—never mind from where—the more the merrier . Pull, then, do
pull; neve r mind the brimstone—devils  are good fellows enough. So, so; there
you are now; that’s the stroke for a thousand pounds; that’s the stroke to sweep
the stakes! Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men
—all hearts alive! Easy , easy; don’t be in a hurry—don’ t be in a hurry . Why
don’t you snap your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so,
then:—softly , softly ! That’ s it—that’ s it! long and strong. Give way there, give
way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuf fin rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop
snoring, ye sleepers,  and pull. Pull, will ye? pull, can’t ye? pull, won’ t ye? Why
in the name of gudgeons and ginger -cakes don’t ye pull?—pull and break
something! pull, and start your eyes out! Here!” whipping out the sharp knife
from his girdle; “every mother ’s son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the
blade betw een his teeth. That’ s it—that’ s it. Now ye do something; that looks
like it, my steel-bits. Start her—start her, my silver -spoons! Start her, marling-
spikes!”
Stubb’ s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had rather a
peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in inculcating the
religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this specimen of his
sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Not at all; and therein consisted his chief peculiarity . He would say the most
terrific things to his crew , in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury,
and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman
could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling
for the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy and
indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar , and so broadly gaped
—open-mouthed at times—that the mere sight of such a yawning commander ,
by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew . Then again, Stubb
was one of those odd sort of humorists,  whose jollity is sometimes so curiously
ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 140/353In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely across
Stubb’ s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each
other , Stubb hailed the mate. “Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir , if ye please!”
“Halloa!” returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he spoke; still
earnestly but whisperingly ur ging his crew; his face set like a flint from Stubb’ s. “What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!”
“Smuggled on board, somehow , before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,
boys!)” in a whisper to his crew , then speaking out loud again: “A sad business,
Mr. Stubb ! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind, Mr. Stubb, all for
the best. Let all your crew pull stron g, come what will. (Spring, my men,
spring!) There’ s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr. Stubb, and that’s what ye came
for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm’ s the play! This at least is duty; duty and
profit hand in hand.”
“Aye, aye, I thought as much,” soliloquized Stubb, when the boats diver ged,
“as soon as I clapt eye on ’em, I thoug ht so. Aye, and that’s what he went into
the after hold for, so often, as Dough- Boy long suspected. They were hidden
down there. The White Whale’ s at the bottom of it. Well, well, so be it!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Can’ t be
helped! All right! Give way , men! It ain’ t the White Whale to-day! Give way!”
Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the
lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably awakened a sort
of superstitious amazement in some of the ship’ s company; but Archy’ s fancied
discovery having some time previous got abroad among them, though indeed not
credited then, this had in some small measure prepared them for the event. It
took off the extreme edge of their wond er; and so what with all this and Stubb’ s
confident way of accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed
from superstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room for all
manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab’ s precise agency in the matter from
the beginn ing. For me, I silently recal led the mysterious shadows I had seen
creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the
enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah. Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the furthest to
windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a circumstance bespeaking
how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed
all steel and whaleb one; like five trip-h ammers they rose and fell with regular
strokes of strength, which periodically started the boat along the water like a
horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer . As for Fedallah, who was
seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and
displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale,
clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon; while at the
other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer ’s, thrown half backward
into the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily
managing his steering oar as in a thousa nd boat lowerings ere the White Whale
had torn him. All at once the outstretch ed arm gave a peculiar motion and then
remained fixed, while the boat’ s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked . Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in the
rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the
blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement, though from
his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it. “Every man look out along his oars!” cried Starbuck. “Thou, Queequeg, stand
up!”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 141/353Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage stood
erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the
chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where
it was also triangula rly platformed level with the gunwale, Starbuck himself was
seen cooll y and adroitly balancing himse lf to the jerking tossings of his chip of a
craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea. Not very far distant Flask’ s boat was also lying breathlessly still; its
commander reckless ly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout sort of
post roote d in the keel, and rising some two feet above the level of the stern
platform. It is used for catching turns with the whale line. Its top is not more
spacious than the palm of a man’ s hand , and standing upon such a base as that,
Flask seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but
her trucks. But little King-Post was small and short, and at the same time little
King-Post was full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead stand -
point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post. “I can’ t see three seas of f; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to that.”
Upon this, Daggoo,  with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way,
swiftly slid aft, and then erecting hims elf volunteered his lofty shoulders for a
pedestal. “Good a mast-head as any , sir. Will you mount?”
“That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you fifty
feet taller .”
Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat,
the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to Flask’ s foot, and
then puttin g Flask’ s hand on his hearse-plumed head and bidding him spring as
he himself should toss, with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and
dry on his shoulders. And here was Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted
arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by . At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous
habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his
boat, even  when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross-running
seas. Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself ,
under such circumstances. But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic
Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent ,
easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty , the noble negro to every roll of the sea
harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired Flask
seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider. Though truly
vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with
impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro’ s lordly
chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimou s
earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that. Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betray ed no such far-gazing solicitudes. The
whales might have made one of their regular soundings, not a temporary dive
from mere fright; and if that were the case, Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it
seems, was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe. He
withdrew it from his hatband, where he always wore it aslant like a feather . He
loaded it, and ramm ed home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he
ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his
harpooneer , whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars,
suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat, crying out in a
quick phrensy of hurry , “Down, down all, and give way!—there they are!”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 142/353To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been visible
at that moment; nothing but a troubled  bit of greenish white water , and thin
scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and suffusingly blowing off to leeward,
like the confused scud from white rolling billows. The air around suddenly
vibrated and tingled, as it were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer
of water , also, the whales were swimm ing. Seen in advance of all the other
indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning courier s
and detached flying outriders. All four boats were now in keen pursuit  of that one spot of troubled water and
air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as a mass of interblending
bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills. “Pull, pull, my good boys,” said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but intensest
concentrated whispe r to his men; while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes
darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two visible needles in two
unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much to his crew , though, nor did
his crew say anything to him. Only the silence of the boat was at intervals
startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with command ,
now soft with entreaty . How different the loud little King-Post. “Sing out and say something, my
hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on their black
backs, boys; only do that for me, and I’ll sign over to you my Martha’ s Vineyard
plantation, boys; including wife and children, boys. Lay me on—lay me on! O
Lord, Lord ! but I shall go stark, staring mad! See! see that white water!” And so
shouting, he pulled his hat from his head, and stamped up and down on it; then
picking it up, flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and
plunging in the boat’ s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie. “Look at that chap now,” philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his
unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a short
distance, followed after—“He’ s got fits, that Flask has. Fits? yes, give him fits—
that’s the very word —pitch fits into ’em. Merrily , merrily , hearts-alive. Pudding
for supper , you know;—merry’ s the word. Pull, babes—pull, sucklings—pull,
all. But what the devil are you hurrying about? Softly , softly , and steadily , my
men. Only  pull, and keep pulling; nothi ng more. Crack all your backbones, and
bite your knives in two—that’ s all. Take it easy—why don’t ye take it easy, I
say, and burst all your livers and lungs!”
But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of his—
these were  words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed light of the
evangelical land. Only the infidel shark s in the audacious seas may give ear to
such word s, when, with tornado brow , and eyes of red murder , and foam-glued
lips, Ahab leaped after his prey . Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of Flask to
“that whale,” as he called the fictitio us monster which he declared to be
incessantly tantalizin g his boat’ s bow with its tail—these allusions of his were at
times so vivid and life-like, that they would cause some one or two of his men to
snatch a fearful look over the shoulder . But this was against all rule; for the
oarsmen must put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage
pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but arms, in
these critical moments. It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the omnipotent
sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled along the eight gunwales,
like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green; the brief suspended agony of6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 143/353the boat, as it would tip for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharpe r
waves, that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip
into the watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the
top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other side;—al l
these, with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps
of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight  of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon
her boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her screaming brood;—all
this was thrilling. Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat
of his first battle; not the dead man’ s ghost encountering the first unknown
phantom in the other world;—neither of these can feel stranger and stronge r
emotions than that man does, who for the first time finds himself pulling into the
charmed, churned circle of the hunted sperm whale. The danci ng white water made by the chase was now becoming more and
more visib le, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung
upon the sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted everywhere to right
and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes. The boats were pulled more
apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward. Our sail
was now set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along; the boat going
with such madness through the water , that the lee oars could scarcely be worked
rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row-locks. Soon we were runni ng through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither ship nor
boat to be seen. “Give way, men,” whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the sheet of his
sail; “there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes. There’ s white water
again!—close to! Spring!”
Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the
other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when with a lightning-
like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: “Stand up!” and Queequeg, harpoon in
hand, sprang to his feet. Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so
close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate
in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent instant had come; they
heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their
litter. Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist, the waves curling
and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents. “That’ s his hump. There, there, give it to him!” whispered Starbuck. A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of
Queequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from
astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail collapsed and
exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by; something rolled and
tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole crew were half suffocated as
they were tossed helter -skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all blended together; and the whale, merely
grazed by the iron, escaped. Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming
round it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,
tumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea, the water
covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing eyes the
suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the
ocean.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 144/353The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together; the
whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white fire upon the
prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal in these jaws of
death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar to the live coals down the
chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm. Meanwhile the
driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the shadows of night; no sign of
the ship could be seen. The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were useless as propellers, performing now the office of life-
preservers. So, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many
failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching it on
a waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty
forlornness. There, then, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man without faith,
hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair . Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat, we
lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over the sea, the
empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom  of the boat. Suddenly Queequeg started
to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear. We all heard a faint creaking, as of
ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm. The sound came nearer and
nearer; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we
all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view , bearing right down
upon us within a distance of not much more than its length. Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it tossed
and gaped beneath the ship’ s bows like a chip at the base of a cataract; and then
the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no more till it came up weltering
astern. Again we swam for it, were dashed against it by the seas, and were at last
taken up and safely landed on board. Ere the squall came close to, the other
boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time. The
ship had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon some
token of our perishing,—an oar or a lance pole. CHAPTER 49.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Hyena. There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we
call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke, though
the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than suspects that the joke is at
nobody’ s expense but his own. Howev er, nothing dispirits, and nothing seem s
worth while disputi ng. He bolts down  all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and
persuasions, all hard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an
ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for smal l
difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster , peril of life and limb; all
these, and death itself, seem to him only sly, good-natured hits, and jolly
punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker .","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man only in some
time of extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness, so that

but a part of the general joke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed
this free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with it I now
regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White Whale its object.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 145/353“Queequeg,” said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the deck, and
I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water; “Queequeg, my
fine friend, does this sort of thing often happen?” Without much emotion,
though soaked through just like me, he gave me to understand that such things
did often happen. “Mr. Stubb,” said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his oil-jacket,
was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; “Mr. Stubb, I think I have heard
you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by
far the most careful and prudent. I supp ose then, that going plump on a flying
whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman’ s
discretion?”
“Certain. I’ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape
Horn.”
“Mr. Flask ,” said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing close by;
“you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you tell me whether it is
an unalter able law in this fishery , Mr. Flask, for an oarsman to break his own
back pulling himself back-foremost into death’ s jaws?”
“Can’ t you twist that smaller?” said Flask. “Yes, that’s the law. I should like to
see a boat’ s crew backing water up to a whale face foremost. Ha, ha! the whale
would give them squint for squint, mind that!”
Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement of the
entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings in the water and
consequent bivouack s on the deep, were matters of common occurrence in this
kind of life; conside ring that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to
the whale I must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boat—
oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the
point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering that the
particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to
Starbuck’ s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall, and
considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great
heedfulness in the fishery; considering  that I belonged to this uncommonly
prudent Starbuck’ s boat; and finally considering in what a devil’ s chase I was
implicated, touching the White Whale: taking all things together , I say, I thought
I might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will. “Queequeg,” said I,
“come along, you shall be my lawyer , executor , and legatee.”
It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last
wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world more fond of that
diversion.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had done the same
thing. After the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion, I felt all the
easier; a stone was rolled away from my heart. Besides, all the days I should
now live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a
supplementary clean  gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be. I
survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

round me tranquilly and contentedly , like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience

goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the devil fetch the
hindmost.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

Crew.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Fedallah. “Who would have thought it, Flask!” cried Stubb; “if I had but one leg you
would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole with my timbe r
toe. Oh! he’ s a wonderful old man!”
“I don’t think it so strange, after all, on that account,” said Flask.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"“If his leg
were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing. That would disable him;
but he has one knee, and good part of the other left, you know .”
“I don’ t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.”
Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether , considering the
paramount importan ce of his life to the success of the voyage, it is right for a
whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase. So
Tamerlane’ s soldier s often argued with tears in their eyes, whether that
invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight. But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that with
two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger; considering that the
pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties; that every
individual moment, indeed, then compri ses a peril; under these circumstances is
it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general
thing, the joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not. Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his
entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase, for
the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person, yet for
Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman
in the hunt—above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as
that same boat’ s crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered
the heads of the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat’ s
crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter . Until Cabaco’s published discovery , the sailors had little foreseen it, though to
be sure when, after being a little while out of port, all hands had concluded the
customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some time after
this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making
thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats,
and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is
running out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when all this was observed in
him, and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the
bottom of the boat, as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his
ivory limb; and also the anxiety he evinc ed in exactly shaping the thigh board, or
clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat’ s bow for
bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was
observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the
semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter ’s chisel gouged out
a little here and straightened it a little there; all these things, I say, had awakened
much interest and curiosity at the time. But almost everybody supposed that this
particular preparativ e heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the
ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his intention to hunt
that morta l monster in person.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"But such a supposition did by no means involve
the remotest suspicion as to any boat’ s crew being assigned to that boat. Now , with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned
away; for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers; and
the ships themselves  often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing
about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck, oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-of f
Japanese junks, and what not; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side
and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain, and it would not create any
unsubduable excitement in the forecastle. But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon
found their place among the crew , thoug h still as it were somehow distinct from
them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like this, by what sort of unaccountable tie
he soon evinced himself to be linked with Ahab’ s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far
as to have  some sort of a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have
been even authority over him; all this none knew . But one cannot sustain an
indifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as civilized,
domestic people in the temperate zone  only see in their dreams, and that but
dimly; but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic
communities, especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent—those
insulated, immemor ial, unalterable countries, which even in these modern days
still preser ve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth’ s primal generations ,
when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his
descendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real phantoms, and
asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end; when
though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of
men, the devils also, add the uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours. CHAPTER 51.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Spirit-Spout. Days, weeks passed , and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly swept
across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off the Cape de Verdes;
on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata; and the
Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery locality , southerly from St. Helena. It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight
night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver; and, by their soft,
suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery silence, not a solitude; on such
a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the
bow. Lit up by the moon, it looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering
god uprisi ng from the sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight
nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a look-ou t
there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet, though herds of
whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a
lowering for them. You may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld
this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the moon,
companions in one sky. But when, after spending his uniform interval there for
several successive nights without uttering a single sound; when, after all this
silence, his unearthly voice was heard  announcing that silvery , moon-lit jet,
every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in
the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew . “There she blows!” Had the trump of
judgment blown, they could not have quivered more; yet still they felt no terror ;6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 148/353rather pleasure. For though it was a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was
the cry, and so deliriously exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively
desired a lowering. Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the
t’gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The best man in the
ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head manned, the piled-up craft
rolled down before the wind. The strange, upheaving, lifting tendency of the
taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering
deck to feel like air beneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two
antagonistic influen ces were struggling in her—one to mount direct to heaven,
the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched
Ahab’ s face that night, you would have  thought that in him also two different
things were warring. While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck,
every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap. On life and death this
old man walked. But though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from every
eye, like arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen that
night. Every sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time. This midn ight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days
after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it was descried
by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it disappeared as if it had
never been.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"And so it served us night after night, till no one heeded it but to
wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the
case migh t be; disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and
somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and
further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on. Nor with the immem orial superstition of their race, and in accordance with the
preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested the Pequod, were
there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever
descried; at however remote times, or in however far apart latitudes and
longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by one self-same whale; and that
whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at
this flittin g appariti on, as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in
order that the monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the
remotest and most savage seas. These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous
potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather , in which, beneath all its
blue bland ness, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as for days and days
we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in
repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-
like prow . But, at last, when turning to the eastw ard, the Cape winds began howling
around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas that are there; when
the ivory-t usked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast, and gored the dark waves in
her madne ss, till, like showers of silve r chips, the foam-flakes flew over her
bulwarks; then all this desolate vacuity  of life went away , but gave place to
sights more dismal than before. Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before
us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And every morning ,
perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and spite of our hootings ,
for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp, as though they deemed our ship
some drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing  appointed to desolation, and therefore
fit roostin g-place for their homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still
unrestingly heaved the black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

had bred. Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called of
yore; for long allure d by the perfidious silences that before had attended us, we
found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where guilty being s
transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed condemned to swim on
everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat that black air without any
horizon. But calm, snow-white, and unvarying; still directing its fountain of
feathers to the sky; still beckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at
times be descried. During all this blackness of the element s, Ahab, though assuming for the time
the almost  continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck, manifested
the gloom iest reserve; and more seldom than ever addressed his mates. In
tempestuous times like these, after everything above and aloft has been secured ,
nothing more can be done but passive ly to await the issue of the gale. Then
Captain and crew become practical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg inserted into
its accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for hours
and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an occasional squall of
sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together . Meantime, the
crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly
broke over its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the
better to guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a
sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened belt. Few
or no words were spoken; and the silent  ship, as if manned by painted sailors in
wax, day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the
demoniac waves. By night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of
the ocean prevailed; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines; still wordless
Ahab stood up to the blast. Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose
he would not seek that repose in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the
old man’ s aspect, when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the
barometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor -
screwed chair; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had
some time before emer ged, still slowly  dripping from the unremoved hat and
coat. On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and
currents which have previously been spoken of.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"His lantern swung from his
tightly clenched hand. Though the body was erect, the head was thrown back so
that the closed eyes were pointed towar ds the needle of the tell-tale that swung
from a beam in the ceiling.*
*The cabin-compas s is called the tell-tale, because without going to the
compass at the helm, the Captain, while  below , can inform himself of the course
of the ship. Terrible old man!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

"The Albatr oss. South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising
ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross) by
name. As she slowly  drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head, I had6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 150/353a good view of that sight so remarkabl e to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries—a
whaler at sea, and long absent from home. As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a
stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral appearance was traced with
long chann els of reddened rust, while all her spars and her rigging were like the
thick branches of trees furred over with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads . They seem ed clad in the skins of beasts , so torn and bepatched the raiment that
had survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops nailed to the
mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship
slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to each
other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one ship to those
of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they
passed, said not one word to our own look-outs, while the quarter -deck hail was
being heard from below . “Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?”
But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in the act of
putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his hand into the sea; and
the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to make himself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between. While in variou s
silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this
ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale’ s name to
another ship, Ahab for a moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would
have lowe red a boat to board the strange r, had not the threatening wind forbade. But taking advantage of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet, and
knowing by her aspect that the strange r vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly
bound home, he loudly hailed—“Ahoy there! This is the Pequod, bound round
the world! Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean! and this
time three years, if I am not at home, tell them to address them to ——”
At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly , then, in
accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish, that for some
days before had been placidly swimming by our side, darted away with what
seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger ’s
flanks. Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before
have notic ed a similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifle s
capriciously carry meanings. “Swim away from me, do ye?” murmu red Ahab, gazing over into the water . There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep
helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But turning to
the steersm an, who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish
her headw ay, he cried out in his old lion voice,—“Up helm! Keep her off round
the world!”
Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings; but
whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through numberless perils
to the very point whence we started, where those that we left behind secure ,
were all the time before us. Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for ever
reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange than any
Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise in the voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in tormented chase of that
demon phantom that, some time or other , swims before all human hearts; while6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

midway leave us whelmed. CHAPTER 53.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Gam. The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had
spoken was this: the wind and sea betok ened storms. But even had this not been
the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded her—judging by his
subsequent conduct on similar occasions—if so it had been that, by the process
of hailing,  he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put. For, as it
eventually turned out, he cared not to consort, even for five minutes, with any
stranger captain, except he could contribute some of that information he so
absorbingly sought. But all this might remain inadequately estimated, were not
something said here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting
each other in foreign seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground. If two strangers crossing the Pine Barre ns in New York State, or the equally
desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering each other in such
inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them, cannot well avoid a mutual
salutation; and stopping for a moment to interchange the news; and, perhaps ,
sitting down for a while and resting in concert: then, how much more natura l
that upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two
whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth—of f lone
Fanning’ s Island, or the far away King’ s Mills; how much more natural, I say,
that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails, but
come into still close r, more friendly and sociable contact. And especially would
this seem to be a matter of course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport,
and whose  captains,  officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to
each other; and consequently , have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk
about. For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder , perhaps, has letters on board;
at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two
later than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files. And in return for that
courtesy , the outward-bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence
from the cruising-gr ound to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost
importance to her. And in degree, all this will hold true concerning whaling
vessels crossing each other ’s track on the cruising-ground itself, even though
they are equally long absent from home . For one of them may have received a
transfer of letters from some third, and now far remote vessel; and some of those
letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets. Besides, they would
exchange the whaling news, and have an agreeable chat. For not only would
they meet  with all the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculia r
congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations
and perils. Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference; that is,
so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case with Americans and
English. Though, to be sure, from the small number of English whalers, such
meetings do not very often occur , and when they do occur there is too apt to be a
sort of shyness betw een them; for your Englishman is rather reserved, and your
Yankee, he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 152/353English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the
American whalers; regarding the long,  lean Nantucketer , with his nondescript
provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this superiority in the English
whalemen does really consist, it would be hard to say, seeing that the Yankees in
one day, collectively , kill more whales than all the English, collectively , in ten
years. But this is a harmless little foible in the English whale-hunters, which the
Nantucketer does not take much to heart; probably , because he knows that he
has a few foibles himself. So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the whalers have
most reaso n to be sociable—and they are so. Whereas, some merchant ships
crossing each other ’s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will oftentimes pass on withou t
so much as a single word of recognition, mutually cutting each other on the high
seas, like a brace of dandies in Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in
finical criticism upon each other ’s rig. As for Men-of-W ar, when they chance to
meet at sea, they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings ,
such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much right-down
hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As touching Slave-ships
meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry , they run away from each
other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross each
other ’s cross-bones,  the first hail is—“How many skulls?”—the same way that
whalers hail—“How many barrels?” And that question once answered, pirates
straightway steer apart, for they are infernal villains on both sides, and don’t like
to see overmuch of each other ’s villanous likenesses. But look at the godly , honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable, free-and-
easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any
sort of decent weath er? She has a “Gam ,” a thing so utterly unknown to all other
ships that they never heard of the name even; and if by chance they should hear
of it, they only grin at it, and repeat gamesome stuff about “spouters” and
“blubber -boilers,” and such like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all
Merchant-seamen, and also all Pirates and Man-of-W ar’s men, and Slave-ship
sailors, cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it
would be hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should like to
know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it. It
sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows. And
besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper foundation
for his superior altitude. Hence, I concl ude, that in boasting himself to be high
lifted above a whaleman, in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand
on. But what is a Gam? You might wear out your index-finger running up and
down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. Dr. Johnson never
attained to that erudition; Noah Webster ’s ark does not hold it. Nevertheless, this
same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some
fifteen thousand true born Yankees. Certainly , it needs a definition, and should
be incorporated into the Lexicon.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"With that view , let me learnedly define it. GAM. NOUN— A social meeting of two (or more) Whaleships, generally on a
cruising-gr ound; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange visits by boats’
crews: the two captains remaining, for the time, on board of one ship, and the
two chief mates on the other . There is another little item about Gamm ing which must not be forgotten here.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"All profes sions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so has the whale
fishery . In a pirate , man-of-war , or slave ship, when the captain is rowed
anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable ,
sometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself with a pretty little6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 153/353milliner ’s tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no
seat astern , no sofa of that sort whatever , and no tiller at all. High times indeed,
if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old
aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any
such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat’ s crew must
leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number , that
subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain, having no place
to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree. And often you will
notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him
from the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the
importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor is this any very
easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him
now and then in the small of his back, the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his
knees in front. He is thus completely wedged before and behind, and can only
expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden,
violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of
foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a spread
angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again, it would neve r
do in plain sight of the world’ s riveted eyes, it would never do, I say, for this
straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching
hold of anything with his hands; indee d, as token of his entire, buoyant self-
command, he generally carries his hand s in his trowsers’  pockets; but perhaps
being generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast . Nevertheless there have occurred instan ces, well authenticated ones too, where
the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two, in a
sudden squall say—to seize hold of the nearest oarsman’ s hair, and hold on there
like grim death. CHAPTER 54.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Town-Ho’ s
Story . (As told at the Golden Inn. )
The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is much
like some noted four corners of a great highway , where you meet more travellers
than in any other part. It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homeward-bound
whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned almost wholly by
Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby
Dick. To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly
heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho’ s story , which seemed obscurely
to involve with the whale a certain wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those
so called judgments  of God which at times are said to overtake some men. This
latter circu mstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may
be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the
ears of Captain Ahab  or his mates. For that secret part of the story was unknown
to the captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the private property of three
confederate white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it
to Tashtego with Romish injunctions  of secrecy , but the following night
Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed so much of it in that way, that when6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 154/353he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an
influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the
full know ledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy , to call it so, were they
governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it
never transpired abaft the Pequod’ s main-mast. Interweaving in its proper place
this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of
this strange af fair I now proceed to put on lasting record. *The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head, still
used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin. For my humor’s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at
Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanis h friends, one saint’ s eve, smoking upon
the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden  Inn. Of those fine cavaliers, the young
Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer terms with me; and hence the
interluding question s they occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the
time. “Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about
rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket, was
cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days’  sail eastward from the eaves
of this good Golden Inn. She was some where to the northward of the Line. One
morning upon handling the pumps, according to daily usage, it was observed
that she made more water in her hold than common. They supposed a sword-fish
had stabbed her, gentlemen. But the captain, having some unusual reason for
believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being
very averse to quit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous,
though, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as
was possible in rather heavy weather , the ship still continued her cruisings, the
mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good luck
came; more days went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it
sensibly increased. So much so, that now taking some alarm, the captain,
making all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands, there to
have his hull hove out and repaired. “Though no small passage was before  her, yet, if the commonest chance
favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way, because
his pumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at them, those six-
and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free; never mind if the leak
should double on her. In truth, well nigh the whole of this passage being
attended by very prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived
in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality , had it not
been for the brutal overbearing of Radney , the mate, a Vineyarder , and the
bitterly provoked vengeance of Steel kilt, a Lakeman and desperado from
Buffalo. “‘Lakeman!—Buf falo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?’  said
Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass. “On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but—I crave your courtesy—
may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now , gentlemen, in square-sail
brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed
out of your old Callao to far Manilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of
our America, had yet been nurture d by all those agrarian freebooting
impressions popularly connected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing
aggregate, those grand fresh-water seas of ours,—Erie, and Ontario, and Huron,
and Superior , and Michigan,—possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many
of the ocean’ s noble st traits; with many  of its rimmed varieties of races and of
climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 155/353Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great contrasting nations ,
as the Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous
territorial colonies from the East, dotted  all round their banks; here and there are
frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw ;
they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they yield
their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their
peltry wigwams; for leagues and league s are flanked by ancient and unentered
forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic
genealogies; those same woods harbori ng wild Afric beasts of prey, and silken
creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the
paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they
float alike  the full-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the
steamer , and the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as
direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are, for out
of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many a midnight ship
with all its shrieking crew . Thus, gentlemen, though an inlander , Steelkilt was
wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtur ed; as much of an audacious mariner as
any.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"And for Radney , though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the
lone Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had
long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he
quite as vengeful and full of social quarr el as the backwoods seaman, fresh from
the latitud es of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet was this Nantucketer a
man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a mariner , who though a
sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible firmness, only tempered by that
common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave’ s right; thus
treated, this Steelkil t had long been retained harmless and docile. At all events ,
he had proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkil t
—but, gentlemen, you shall hear . “It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for
her island haven, that the Town-Ho’ s leak seemed again increasing, but only so
as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day. You must know that in a
settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think
little of pumping their whole way across  it; though of a still, sleepy night, should
the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the probability
would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on accoun t
of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom. Nor in the solitary and savage seas
far from you to the westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to
keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of
considerable length;  that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any
other reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is in
some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless latitude, that
her captain begins to feel a little anxious. “Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found
gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by severa l
of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the upper sails
to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew , and every way expanded to the breeze . Now this Radney , I suppose, was as little of a coward, and as little inclined to
any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless,
unthinking creature  on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine,
gentlemen. Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the
ship, some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part
owner in her. So when they were worki ng that evening at the pumps, there was
on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood
with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 156/353mountain spring, gentlemen—that bubb ling from the pumps ran across the deck ,
and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper -holes. “Now , as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional world
of ours—watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command over his
fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general
pride of manhood, straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable
dislike and bitterness; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize
that subaltern’ s tower , and make a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of
mine as it may, gentlemen, at all even ts Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal
with a head like a Roman, and a flowing  golden beard like the tasseled housings
of your last viceroy ’s snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in
him, gentlemen, which had made Steelk ilt Charlemagne, had he been born son
to Charlem agne’ s father. But Radney , the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy ,
as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it. “Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest,
the Lakem an affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with his gay
banterings. “‘Aye, aye, my merry lads, it’s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin, one of ye,
and let’s have a taste. By the Lord, it’s worth bottling! I tell ye what, men, old
Rad’ s investment must go for it! he had best cut away his part of the hull and
tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he’s come
back again with a gang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not;
and the whole posse of ’em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the
bottom; making improvements, I suppos e. If old Rad were here now, I’d tell him
to jump overboard and scatter ’em. They’re playing the devil with his estate, I
can tell him. But he’s a simple old soul,—Rad, and a beauty too. Boys, they say
the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I wonder if he’d give a
poor devil like me the model of his nose.’
“‘Damn your eyes! what’ s that pump stopping for?’ roared Radney ,
pretending not to have heard the sailors’  talk. ‘Thunder away at it!’
“‘Aye, aye, sir,’ said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. ‘Lively , boys, lively , now!’
And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines; the men tossed their hats
off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denote s
the fullest tension of life’ s utmost ener gies. “Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went
forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face fiery red, his
eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow . Now what
cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle with such a
man in that corpor eally exasperated state, I know not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and
sweep down the planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters
consequent upon allowing a pig to run at lar ge. “Now , gentlemen, sweeping a ship’ s deck at sea is a piece of household work
which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening; it has
been know n to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time. Such,
gentlemen, is the inflexibility of sea-usa ges and the instinctive love of neatnes s
in seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their
faces. But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the
boys, if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho
that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most
athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one
of the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 157/353not connec ted with truly nautical duties,  such being the case with his comrades. I
mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair
stood between the two men. “But there  was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as
plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkil t, as though Radney had spat in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this; and all this
and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate
uttered his comman d. But as he sat still for a moment, and as he steadfastly
looked into the mate’ s malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder -casks
heaped up in him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he
instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up
the deeper passionateness in any alread y ireful being—a repugnance most felt,
when felt at all, by really valiant men even when aggrieved—this nameless
phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt. “Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion
he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not
his busine ss, and he would not do it. And then, without at all alluding to the
shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers; who, not being
billeted at the pumps, had done little or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied
with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally
reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman ,
with an uplifted cooper’s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near
by. “Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for all his
first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could but ill brook
this bearin g in the mate; but somehow still smothering the conflagration within
him, witho ut speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the
incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously
commanding him to do his bidding. “Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily followed by
the mate with his menacing hammer , deliberately repeated his intention not to
obey . Seeing, howe ver, that his forbear ance had not the slightest effect, by an
awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the
foolish and infatuated man; but it was to no purpose. And in this way the two
went once  slowly round the windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat,
bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor ,
the Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the of ficer:
“‘Mr . Radney , I will not obey you. Take that hammer away , or look to
yourself.’  But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where the
Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth ;
meanwhile repeatin g a string of insuf ferable maledictions. Retreating not the
thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard
of his glance, Steel kilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly
drawing it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he
(Steelkilt) would murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the
slaughter by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next
instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch
spouting blood like a whale. “Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading
far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads. They were
both Canallers.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

harbours, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are they?’
“‘Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal. You
must have heard of it.’
“‘Nay , Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary land,
we know but little of your vigorous North.’
“‘Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha’ s very fine; and ere
proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such information
may throw side-light upon my story .’
“For three  hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire breadth of
the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and most thriving
villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and affluent, cultivated
fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard -room and bar-room; through the holy-
of-holies of great forests; on Roman arches over Indian rivers; through sun and
shade; by happy hearts or broken; through all the wide contrasting scenery of
those noble Mohawk counties; and especially , by rows of snow-white chapels ,
whose spires stand almost like miles tones, flows one continual stream of
Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life. There’ s your true Ashantee, gentlemen ;
there howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you; under the
long-flung shadow , and the snug patronising lee of churches. For by some
curious fatality , as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they
ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen, most abound in
holiest vicinities. “‘Is that a friar passing?’  said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the
crowded plazza, with humorous concern. “‘Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella’ s Inquisition wanes in Lima,’
laughed Don Sebastian. ‘Proceed, Senor .’
“‘A mome nt! Pardo n!’ cried another of the company . ‘In the name of all us
Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor , that we have by no mean s
overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for distant Venice in
your corru pt compa rison. Oh! do not bow and look surprised; you know the
proverb all along this coast—“Corrupt as Lima.” It but bears out your saying,

“Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would make a
fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he. Like Mark
Antony , for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery Nile, he indolently
floats, openly toying with his red-cheek ed Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh
upon the sunny deck. But ashore, all this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish
guise which the Canaller so proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat
betoken his grand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages
through which he floats; his swart visage  and bold swagger are not unshunned in
cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received good turns from one
of these Canallers; I thank him heartily ; would fain be not ungrateful; but it is
often one of the prim e redeeming qualities of your man of violence, that at times
he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy
one. In sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is emphatically
evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its most
finished graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind, except Sydney men, are
so much distrusted by our whaling captains. Nor does it at all diminish the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

men born along its line, the probationa ry life of the Grand Canal furnishes the
sole transi tion between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and recklessly
ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas. “‘I see!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"I see!’ impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha upon his
silvery ruffles. ‘No need to travel! The world’ s one Lima. I had thought, now,
that at your temperate North the generations were cold and holy as the hills.—
But the story .’
“I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay . Hardly had he
done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four
harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down the ropes like
baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed  into the uproar , and sought to drag their
man out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the sailors joined with them in
this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm’ s way, the
valiant captain danc ed up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers
to manhan dle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the quarter -deck . At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying
into the heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in
gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large
casks in a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves
behind the barricade. “‘Come out of that, ye pirates!’  roared the captain, now menacing them with a
pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. ‘Come out of that, ye
cut-throats!’
“Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there, defied the
worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to understand distinctly , that his
(Steelkilt’ s) death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all
hands. Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little
desisted, but still commanded the insur gents instantly to return to their duty . “‘Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?’  demanded their ringleader . “‘Turn to! turn to!—I make no promise;—to your duty! Do you want to sink
the ship, by knockin g off at a time like this? Turn to!’ and he once more raised a
pistol. “‘Sink the ship?’  cried Steelkilt. ‘Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us turns to,
unless you swear not to raise a rope-yar n against us. What say ye, men?’  turning
to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their response. “The Lake man now patrolled the barric ade, all the while keeping his eye on
the Captai n, and jerking out such sentences as these:—‘It’ s not our fault; we
didn’ t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was boy’s business; he
might have known me before this; I told him not to prick the buffalo; I believe I
have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw; ain’t those mincing knive s
down in the forecastle there, men? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to yourself; say the word; don’t be a fool; forget it all; we
are ready to turn to; treat us decently , and we’re your men; but we won’ t be
flogged.’
“‘Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!’
“‘Look ye, now,’ cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him, ‘there
are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for the cruise,
d’ye see; now as you well know , sir, we can claim our dischar ge as soon as the
anchor is down; so we don’t want a row; it’s not our interest; we want to be
peaceable; we are ready to work, but we won’ t be flogged.’6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 160/353“‘Turn to!’  roared the Captain. “Steelkilt glanced round him a moment , and then said:—‘I tell you what it is
now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby rascal, we won’ t
lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till you say the word about not
flogging us, we don’ t do a hand’ s turn.’
“‘Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I’ll keep ye there till ye’re sick
of it. Down ye go.’
“‘Shall we?’ cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against it; but
at length, in obedien ce to Steelkilt, they preceded him down into their dark den,
growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave. “As the Lakeman’ s bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain and
his posse leaped the barricade, and rapid ly drawing over the slide of the scuttle,
planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called for the steward to bring
the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway . Then opening the slide
a little, the Captain whispered somethin g down the crack, closed it, and turned
the key upon them— ten in number—leaving on deck some twenty or more, who
thus far had remained neutral. “All night  a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and aft,
especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at which last place it
was feared  the insur gents might emer ge, after breaking through the bulkhead
below . But the hours of darkness passed in peace; the men who still remained at
their duty toiling hard at the pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals
through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship. “At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck, summoned
the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was then lowered
down to them, and a couple of handfu ls of biscuit were tossed after it; when
again turning the key upon them and pocketing it, the Captain returned to the
quarter -deck. Twice every day for three days this was repeated; but on the fourth
morning a confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary
summons was delivered; and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle ,
saying they were ready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing
diet, unite d perhaps  to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them
to surrend er at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand
to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and
betake himself where he belonged. On the fifth morning three others of the
mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to
restrain them. Only three were left. “‘Better turn to, now?’  said the Captain with a heartless jeer . “‘Shut us up again, will ye!’  cried Steelkilt. “‘Oh certainly ,’ said the Captain, and the key clicked. “It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of seven of his
former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him, and
maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair ;
it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two Canallers, thus far apparently of
one mind with him, to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the
garrison; and armed with their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy
implements with a handle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the
taffrail; and if by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For
himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not. That was the
last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met with no opposition on
the part of the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or for any other
mad thing , for anything in short but a surrender . And what was more, they each6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 161/353insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the time to make the rush
should come. But to this their leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority
for himsel f; particularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the
other , in the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder would but
admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants
must come out. “Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader , each in his own separate soul
had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece of treachery , namely:
to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be the first of the three, though the
last of the ten, to surrender; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon
such conduct might merit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination
still to lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of
villany , mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their leader fell
into a doze, verball y opened their souls to each other in three sentences; and
bound the sleeper with cords, and gagg ed him with cords; and shrieked out for
the Captain at midnight. “Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and all
his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a few minutes the
scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still struggling ringleader was
shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies, who at once claimed the honor of
securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder . But all these were collared ,
and dragged along the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up
into the mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till
morning. ‘Damn ye,’ cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them, ‘the
vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!’
“At sunris e he summoned all hands; and separating those who had rebelled
from those who had taken no part in the mutiny , he told the former that he had a
good mind  to flog them all round—thought, upon the whole, he would do so—
he ought to—justice demanded it; but for the present, considering their timely
surrender , he would let them go with a reprimand, which he accordingly
administered in the vernacular . “‘But as for you, ye carrion rogues,’  turning to the three men in the rigging
—‘for you, I mean  to mince ye up for the try-pots;’  and, seizing a rope, he
applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors, till they yelled no
more, but lifelessly hung their heads sideways, as the two crucified thieves are
drawn. “‘My wrist is sprained with ye!’ he cried , at last; ‘but there is still rope enough
left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn’ t give up. Take that gag from his
mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.’
“For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his
cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a sort of hiss,
‘What I say is this—and mind it well—if you flog me, I murder you!’
“‘Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me’—and the Captain drew off with the
rope to strike. “‘Best not,’  hissed the Lakeman. “‘But I must,’—and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke. “Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain; who, to
the amaze ment of all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly two or three
times, and then sudd enly throwing down his rope, said, ‘I won’ t do it—let him
go—cut him down: d’ye hear?’
“But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order , a pale man, with
a bandaged head, arrested them—Radne y the chief mate. Ever since the blow , he6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 162/353had lain in his berth; but that morning,  hearing the tumult on the deck, he had
crept out, and thus far had watched the whole scene. Such was the state of his
mouth, that he could hardly speak; but mumbling something about his being
willing and able to do what the captain  dared not attempt, he snatched the rope
and advanced to his pinioned foe. “‘You are a coward!’  hissed the Lakeman. “‘So I am, but take that.’  The mate was in the very act of striking, when
another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing no more, made
good his word, spite of Steelkilt’ s threat, whatever that might have been. The
three men were then cut down, all hands were turned to, and, sullenly worked by
the moody seamen, the iron pumps clanged as before. “Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below , a clamor was
heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up, besieged the
cabin door, saying they durst not conso rt with the crew . Entreaties, cuffs, and
kicks could not drive them back, so at their own instance they were put down in
the ship’ s run for salvation. Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary , it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt’ s instigation, they had
resolved to maintain  the strictest peace fulness, obey all orders to the last, and,
when the ship reached port, desert her in a body . But in order to insure the
speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely , not to
sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For, spite of her leak, and
spite of all her other perils, the Town-H o still maintained her mast-heads, and
her captain  was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on the day his
craft first struck the cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to
change his berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death
the vital jaw of the whale. “But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of
passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all was over)
concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him
in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief mate’ s watch; and as if
the infatua ted man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom, after the
scene at the rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon
resuming the head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other
circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge. “During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the
bulwarks of the quarter -deck, and leanin g his arm upon the gunwale of the boat
which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship’ s side. In this attitude, it was
well know n, he sometimes dozed. There was a considerable vacancy between
the boat and the ship, and down between  this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his
time, and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o’clock,
in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his
leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his
watches below . “‘What are you making there?’  said a shipmate. “‘What do you think? what does it look like?’
“‘Like a lanyard for your bag; but it’ s an odd one, seems to me.’
“‘Yes, rather oddish ,’ said the Lakeman,  holding it at arm’s length before him;
‘but I think it will answer . Shipmate, I haven’ t enough twine,—have you any?’
“But there was none in the forecastle. “‘Then I must get some from old Rad;’  and he rose to go aft. “‘You don’ t mean to go a begging to him!’ said a sailor .6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 163/353“‘Why not? Do you think he won’ t do me a turn, when it’s to help himself in
the end, shipmate?’  and going to the mate, he looked at him quietly , and asked
him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given him—neither twine nor
lanyard were seen again; but the next night an iron ball, closely netted, partly
rolled from  the pocket of the Lakeman’ s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the
coat into his hamm ock for a pillow . Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the
silent helm —nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready
dug to the seaman’ s hand—that fatal hour was then to come; and in the fore-
ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse,
with his forehead crushed in. “But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed he
had planned.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the avenger . For
by a myste rious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands
into its own the damning thing he would have done. “It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day,
when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Tenerif fe man, drawing
water in the main-c hains, all at once shouted out, ‘There she rolls! there she
rolls!’  Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick. “‘Moby Dick!’  cried Don Sebastian; ‘St. Dominic! Sir sailor , but do whales
have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?’
“‘A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster , Don;—but
that would be too long a story .’
“‘How? how?’  cried all the young Spaniards, crowding. “‘Nay , Dons, Dons— nay, nay! I canno t rehearse that now. Let me get more
into the air , Sirs.’
“‘The chicha! the chicha!’  cried Don Pedro; ‘our vigorous friend looks faint;
—fill up his empty glass!’
“No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.—Now , gentlemen, so
suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship—for getful of
the compact among the crew—in the excitement of the moment, the Tenerif fe
man had instinctivel y and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster , though
for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-
heads. All was now a phrensy . ‘The White Whale—the White Whale!’  was the
cry from captain, mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours,
were all anxious to capture so famous  and precious a fish; while the dogged
crew eyed  askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass ,
that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal
in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole caree r
of these events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted. The
mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty
to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow , and haul in or
slacken the line, at the word of comman d. Moreover , when the four boats were
lowered, the mate’ s got the start; and none howled more fiercely with delight
than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got
fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow. He was always a furious
man, it seems, in a boat. And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the
whale’ s topmost back. Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up,
through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the
boat struck as again st a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing
mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale’ s slippery back, the boat righted, and
was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into the sea, on the
other flank of the whale. He struck out through the spray , and, for an instant, was6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 164/353dimly seen through that veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of
Moby Dick. But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the
swimmer between his jaws; and rearin g high up with him, plunged headlong
again, and went down. “Meantime, at the first tap of the boat’ s bottom, the Lakeman had slackened
the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly looking on, he though t
his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward jerking of the boat, quickly
brought his knife to the line. He cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some
distance, Moby Dick  rose again, with some tatters of Radney’ s red woollen shirt,
caught in the teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but
the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared. “In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary place—
where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the Lakeman, all but five
or six of the forema stmen deliberately deserted among the palms; eventually , as
it turned out, seizing a large double war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for
some other harbor . “The ship’ s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called upon
the Islande rs to assist him in the laborio us business of heaving down the ship to
stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this
small band of whites  necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was
the hard work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea,
they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with
them in so heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the
ship as far off shore as possible; loade d and ran out his two cannon from the
bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the Islanders not to
approach the ship at their peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of
his best whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred
miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew . “On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed to
have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from it; but the savage
craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to,
or he would run him under water . The captain presented a pistol. With one foot
on each prow of the yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn;
assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him
in bubbles and foam. “‘What do you want of me?’  cried the captain.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"“‘Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?’  demanded Steelkilt;
‘no lies.’
“‘I am bound to Tahiti for more men.’
“‘Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.’  With that he
leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale, stood face
to face with the captain. “‘Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now , repeat after me. As soon
as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder island, and remain
there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike me!’
“‘A pretty scholar ,’ laughed the Lakeman. ‘Adios, Senor!’  and leaping into the
sea, he swam back to his comrades. “Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the roots of the
cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due time arrived at Tahiti, his
own place of destination. There, luck befriended him; two ships were about to
sail for France, and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

former captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution. “Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived, and the
captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians, who had been
somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small native schooner , he returned with
them to his vessel; and finding all right there, again resumed his cruisings. “Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of
Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up
its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him. * * * *
“‘Are you through?’  said Don Sebastian, quietly . “‘I am, Don.’
“‘Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions, this your
story is in substance really true? It is so passing wonderful!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Did you get it from
an unquestionable source? Bear with me if I seem to press.’
“‘Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don Sebastian’ s suit,’
cried the company , with exceeding interest. “‘Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn, gentlemen?’
“‘Nay ,’ said Don Sebastian; ‘but I know a worthy priest near by, who will
quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well advised? this may grow
too serious.’
“‘Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?’
“‘Though there are no Auto-da-Fés in Lima now,’ said one of the company to
another; ‘I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy . Let us
withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.’
“‘Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg that
you will be particular in procuring the lar gest sized Evangelists you can.’

“‘This is the priest , he brings you the Evangelists,’  said Don Sebastian,
gravely , returning with a tall and solemn figure. “‘Let me remove my hat. Now , venerable priest, further into the light, and
hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it. “‘So help me Heave n, and on my honor the story I have told ye, gentlemen, is
in substance and its great items, true. I know it to be true; it happened on this
ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I have seen and talked with Steelkilt since
the death of Radney .’”
CHAPTER 55. Of the Monstr ous
Pictur es of Whales. I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas, something like
the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman
when in his own absolute body the whal e is moored alongside the whale-ship so
that he can be fairly stepped upon there. It may be worth while, therefore ,
previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even
down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 166/353time to set the world right in this matter , by proving such pictures of the whale
all wrong. It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found
among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For ever since those
inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples, the
pedestals of statues, and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was
drawn in scales of chain-armor like Saladin’ s, and a helmeted head like St. Geor ge’s; ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed,
not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific
presentations of him. Now , by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be
the whale’ s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephanta, in India . The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial
pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were
prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being. No wonder then,
that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there
shadowed forth. The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department
of the wall, depict ing the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan,
learnedly known as the Matse Avatar . But though this sculpture is half man and
half whale , so as only to give the tail of the latter , yet that small section of him is
all wrong. It looks more like the taper ing tail of an anaconda, than the broad
palms of the true whale’ s majestic flukes. But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian painter ’s portrait
of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian Hindoo. It is Guido’ s
picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where
did Guido  get the model of such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in
painting the same scene in his own “Perseus Descending,” make out one whit
better . The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface ,
scarcely drawing one inch of water . It has a sort of howdah on its back, and its
distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the
Traitors’  Gate leadin g from the Thames by water into the Tower . Then, there are
the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah’ s whale, as depicted in
the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of these? As for the book-binder ’s whale windin g like a vine-stalk round the stock of a
descending anchor— as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many
books both old and new—that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature,
imitated, I take it, from the like figure s on antique vases. Though universally
denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this book-binder ’s fish an attempt at a
whale; because it was so intended when the device was first introduced. It was
introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century , during
the Reviva l of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a comparatively
late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan. In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at
times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all manner of spouts ,
jets d’eau,  hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden, come bubbling up
from his unexhausted brain. In the title-page of the original edition of the
“Advancement of Learning” you will find some curious whales. But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those pictures
of leviathan purporting to be sober , scientific delineations, by those who know . In old Harris’s colle ction of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted
from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671, entitled “A Whaling Voyage to
Spitzber gen in the ship Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master .”
In one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 167/353among ice-isles, with white bears running over their living backs. In anothe r
plate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with
perpendicular flukes. Then again, there is an imposing quart o, written by one Captain Colnett, a
Post Captain in the English navy , entitled “A Voyage round Cape Horn into the
South Seas, for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.” In
this book is an outline purporting to be a “Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti
whale, drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793,
and hoiste d on deck.” I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for
the benefit of his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let me say that it
has an eye which applied, according to the accompanying scale, to a full grown
sperm whale, would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet
long. Ah, my gallan t captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that
eye! Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit
of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of mistake. Look at that
popular work “Goldsmith’ s Animated Nature.” In the abridged London edition
of 1807, there are plates of an alleged “whale” and a “narwhale.” I do not wish
to seem inelegant, but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow;
and, as for the narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this
nineteenth century such a hippogrif f could be palmed for genuine upon any
intelligent public of schoolboys. Then, again, in 1825 , Bernard Germain, Count de Lacépède, a great naturalist,
published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are several pictures of the
different species of the Leviathan. All these are not only incorrect, but the
picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale (that is to say, the Right whale) ,
even Scoresby , a long experienced man as touching that species, declares not to
have its counterpart in nature. But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved
for the scientific Frederick Cuvier , brother to the famous Baron. In 1836, he
published a Natural History of Whales, in which he gives what he calls a picture
of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer , you had
best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick
Cuvier ’s Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he neve r
had the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he
derived that picture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecesso r
in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that is, from a
Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are,
many queer cups and saucers inform us. As for the sign-pain ters’ whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of
oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally Richard III. whales,
with dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting on three or four sailo r
tarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners : their deformities floundering in seas of
blood and blue paint. But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising
after all. Consider! Most of the scienti fic drawings have been taken from the
stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship, with
broken back, would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed
pride of hull and spars. Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the
living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The living
whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in
unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like a
launched line-of-ba ttle ship; and out of that element it is a thing eternally6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 168/353impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to preserve all
his mighty swells and undulations. And, not to speak of the highly presumable
difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a full-grown Platonian
Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to
a ship’s deck, such is then the outlandi sh, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of
him, that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch. But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale,
accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all. For it is one of
the more curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton gives very little
idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy Bentham’ s skeleton, which hangs for
candelabra in the library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a
burly-browed utilita rian old gentleman, with all Jeremy’ s other leading personal
characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan’ s
articulated bones. In fact, as the great  Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the
whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the
insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is
strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will be incidentally
shown. It is also very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which
almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger . But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human
fingers in an artifici al covering. “However recklessly the whale may sometime s
serve us,” said humo rous Stubb one day, “he can never be truly said to handle us
without mittens.”
For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs
conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must
remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the mark much nearer
than another , but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earth ly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks
like. And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his
living contour , is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no smal l
risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you
had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan. CHAPTER 56. Of the Less
Erroneous Pictur es of Whales, and
the True Pictur es of Whaling
Scenes. In connex ion with the monstrous pictu res of whales, I am strongly tempted
here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be
found in certain books, both ancient and modern, especially in Pliny , Purchas,
Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier , etc. But I pass that matter by . I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale; Colnett’ s,
Huggins’ s, Frederick Cuvier ’s, and Beale’ s. In the previous chapter Colnett and
Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins’ s is far better than theirs; but, by great
odds, Beale’ s is the best. All Beale’ s drawings of this whale are good, excepting6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 169/353the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his
second chapter . His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no
doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is admirably
correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in
J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour; but they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though. Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they are
drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has but one
picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency , because it is by such
pictures only, when at all well done, that you can derive anything like a truthfu l
idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters. But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details not the most
correct, presentation s of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found, are
two large French engravings, well executed, and taken from paintings by one
Garnery . Respective ly, they represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In
the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just
risen bene ath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the
air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of the boat is
partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the monster ’s spine; and
standing in that prow , for that one single incomputable flash of time, you behold
an oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the
act of leaping, as if from a precipic e. The action of the whole thing is
wonderfully good and true. The half-em ptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea;
the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the
swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of
affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the
scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale, but
let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw so good a one. In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the
barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black weedy bulk
in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian cliffs. His jets are
erect, full, and black like soot; so that from so abounding a smoke in the
chimney , you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great
bowels below . Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea
candies and maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his
pestilent back. And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the
deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the sligh t
boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean
steamer . Thus, the foreground is all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable
artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched
sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered
fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole inserted into
his spout-hole. Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he was
either practically conversant with his subject, or else marvellously tutored by
some experienced whaleman. The French are the lads for painting action. Go
and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe, and where will you find such a
gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at
Versailles; where the beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive
great battles of France; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights,
and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a charge of crowned
centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery , are these sea battle-
pieces of Garnery .6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 170/353The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of things
seems to be peculiarly evinced in what  paintings and engravings they have of
their whal ing scenes . With not one tenth of England’ s experience in the fishery ,
and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans, they have nevertheles s
furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of
conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt. For the most part, the English and
American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the
mechanical outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so
far as picturesquene ss of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to sketching
the profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby , the justly renowned Right whaleman ,
after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale, and three or four
delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series of classical
engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels; and with the
microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering
world ninety-six fac-similes of magni fied Arctic snow crystals. I mean no
disparagement to the excellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so
important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every
crystal a sworn af fidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace. In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery , there are two other French
engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself “H. Durand.”
One of them, though  not precisely adap ted to our present purpose, nevertheles s
deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of
the Pacific; a French  whaler anchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water
on board; the loosened sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the
background, both drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine,
when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one
of their few aspects  of oriental repose. The other engraving is quite a different
affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the
Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the act of cutting -
in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off
from this scene of activity , is about giving chase to whales in the distance. The
harpoons and lances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast
in its hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands half-erect
out of the water , like a rearing horse. From the ship, the smoke of the torment s
of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies; and to
windward, a black cloud, rising up with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to
quicken the activity of the excited seamen. CHAPTER 57. Of Whales in Paint;
in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Ir on;
in Stone; in Mountains; in Stars. On Tower -hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a
crippled beggar (or kedger , as the sailors say) holding a painted board before
him, repre senting the tragic scene in which he lost his leg. There are three
whales and three boats; and one of the boats (presumed to contain the missing
leg in all its original integrity) is being  crunched by the jaws of the foremos t
whale. Any time these ten years, they tell me, has that man held up that picture,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 171/353and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his
justification has now come. His three whales are as good whales as were ever
published in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as
any you will find in the western clearing s. But, though for ever mounted on that
stump, never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman make; but, with downcast
eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation. Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag
Harbor , you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling-scenes,
graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth, or ladies’  busks
wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and other like skrimshander articles, as
the whale men call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately
carve out of the rough material, in their hours of ocean leisure. Some of them
have little boxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the
skrimshandering business. But, in general, they toil with their jack-knives alone;
and, with that almo st omnipotent tool of the sailor , they will turn you out
anything you please, in the way of a mariner ’s fancy . Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that
condition in which God placed him, i.e. what is called savagery . Your true
whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I myself am a savage, owning
no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel
against him. Now , one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours, is
his wonde rful patience of industry . An ancient Hawaiian war-club or spear -
paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving, is as great a trophy of
human perseverance  as a Latin lexicon. For, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or
a shark’s tooth, that miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been
achieved; and it has cost steady years of steady application. As with the Hawaiia n savage, so with the white sailor -savage. With the same
marvellous patience , and with the same single shark’ s tooth, of his one poor
jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not quite as workmanlike,
but as close packed  in its maziness of design, as the Greek savage, Achilles’ s
shield; and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old
Dutch savage, Albert Durer . Wooden whales, or whales cut in profi le out of the small dark slabs of the
noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the forecastles of
American whalers. Some of them are done with much accuracy . At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by
the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is sleepy , the anvil-
headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales are seldom remarkable
as faithful  essays. On the spires of some old-fashioned churches you will see
sheet-iron whales placed there for weather -cocks; but they are so elevated, and
besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with “Hands off!” you
cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit. In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken cliffs
masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain, you will often
discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan partly merged in
grass, which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green sur ges. Then, again, in mountainous countrie s where the traveller is continually
girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from some lucky point of
view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the
undulating ridges. But you must be a thorough whaleman, to see these sights;
and not only that, but if you wish to return to such a sight again, you must be6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 172/353sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-
point, else so chance-like are such observations of the hills, that your precise,
previous stand-poin t would require a laborious re-discovery; like the Soloma
Islands, which still remain incognita, though once high-ruf fed Mendanna trod
them and old Figuera chronicled them. Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out great
whales in the starry  heavens, and boats  in pursuit of them; as when long filled
with thoug hts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the
clouds. Thus at the North have I chase d Leviathan round and round the Pole
with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me. And
beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined
the chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and
the Flying Fish. With a frigate’ s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs,
would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to see whether the
fabled heavens with all their countless  tents really lie encamped beyond my
mortal sight! CHAPTER 58.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Brit. Steering north-eastw ard from the Croze tts, we fell in with vast meadows of
brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale largely feeds . For leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that we seemed to be sailing
through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat. On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from the
attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly swam
through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous Venetian
blind in their mouth s, was in that manner separated from the water that escaped
at the lip. As mornin g mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their
scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these monster s
swam, making a strange, grassy , cutting sound; and leaving behind them endless
swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*
*That part of the sea known among whalemen as the “Brazil Banks” does not
bear that name as the Banks of New foundland do, because of there being
shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable meadow-like
appearance, caused  by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those
latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased. But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all
reminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when they
paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms looked more like
lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in the great hunting countries
of India, the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent
elephants without knowing them to be such, taking them for bare, blackened
elevations of the soil; even so, often, with him, who for the first time behold s
this specie s of the leviathans of the sea. And even when recognised at last, their
immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masse s6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

lives in a dog or a horse. Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with
the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though some old naturalists
have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea; and
though taking a broad general view of the thing, this may very well be; yet
coming to specialtie s, where, for example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in
disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark
alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him. But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas have
ever been regarded with emotions unsp eakably unsocial and repelling; though
we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita, so that Columbus sailed
over numb erless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one;
though, by vast odds, the most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially
and indisc riminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have
gone upon  the waters; though but a moment’ s consideration will teach, that
however baby man may brag of his science and skill, and however much, in a
flattering future, that science and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever, to
the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize the
stateliest, stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the continual repetition of
these very impressions, man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea
which aboriginally belongs to it. The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese vengeance
had whelm ed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow . That same
ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year. Yea,
foolish mortals, Noah’ s flood is not yet subsided; two thirds of the fair world it
yet covers. Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a miracle
upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews, when under the
feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up
for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in precisely the same manner the
live sea swallows up ships and crews. But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it is also a
fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own
guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned. Like a savage tigress
that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes even the
mightiest whales against the rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the
split wrecks of ships. No mercy , no power but its own controls it. Panting and
snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean
overruns the globe. Consider the subtlen ess of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide under
water , unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden beneath the
loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many
of its most remorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many species
of sharks. Consider , once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose
creatures prey upon each other , carrying on eternal war since the world began. Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile earth;
consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a strange analogy
to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land,
so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but
encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life. God keep thee! Push not
off from that isle, thou canst never return!6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling her keel, so that
in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that
languid breeze, as three mild palms on a plain. And still, at wide intervals in the
silvery night, the lonely , alluring jet would be seen. But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural spread
over the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when the long
burnished sun-glade  on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them ,
enjoining some secrecy; when the slipp ered waves whispered together as they
softly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was
seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head. In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and higher ,
and disentangling itself from the azure,  at last gleamed before our prow like a
snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening for a moment, as slowly it
subsided, and sank. Then once more arose, and silently gleamed. It seemed not a
whale; and yet is this Moby Dick? thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went
down, but on re-appearing once more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every
man from his nod, the negro yelled out—“There! there again!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"there she
breaches! right ahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!”
Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the bees
rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on the bowsprit,
and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the
helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the
outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo. Whether the flitting  attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually
worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of
mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued;
however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed him; whichever way it
might have been, no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass, than with
a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering. The four boats were soon on the wate r; Ahab’ s in advance, and all swiftly
pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with oars suspended ,
we were awaiting its reappearance, lo!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"in the same spot where it sank, once more
it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we
now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have
hitherto revealed to mankind. A vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth,
of a glancing cream-colour , lay floating on the water , innumerable long arms
radiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas, as if
blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach. No perceptible face or front
did it have ; no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct; but undulated
there on the billows, an unearthly , formless, chance-like apparition of life. As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still
gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice exclaimed
—“Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick  and fought him, than to have seen thee,
thou white ghost!”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 175/353“What was it, Sir?” said Flask. “The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld, and
returned to their ports to tell of it.”
But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel; the rest
as silently following. Whatever superstitio ns the sperm whal emen in general have connected with
the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it being so very unusual,
that circum stance has gone far to invest it with portentousness. So rarely is it
beheld, that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing
in the ocean, yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning
its true nature and form; notwithstandin g, they believe it to furnish to the sperm
whale his only food. For though other species of whales find their food above
water , and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the spermaceti whale
obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface; and only by
inference is it that any one can tell of what, precisely , that food consists. At
times, when closely pursued, he will disgor ge what are supposed to be the
detached arms of the squid; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and
thirty feet in length. They fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged
ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale ,
unlike other species, is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it. There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop
Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in which the
Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with some other particular s
he narrates, in all this the two correspon d. But much abatement is necessary with
respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it. By some naturalist s who have vague ly heard rumors of the mysterious
creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of cuttle-fish, to which,
indeed, in certain external respects it would seem to belong, but only as the
Anak of the tribe. CHAPTER 60.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Line. With refer ence to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as for the
better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented, I have here to
speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line. The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly vapored
with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary ropes; for while tar,
as ordinar ily used, makes the hemp more pliable to the rope-maker , and also
renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use; yet,
not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the
close coiling to which it must be subject ed; but as most seamen are beginning to
learn, tar in general by no means adds to the rope’ s durability or strength,
however much it may give it compactness and gloss. Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely
superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not so durable as
hemp, it is stronger , and far more soft and elastic; and I will add (since there is
an æstheti cs in all things), is much more handsome and becoming to the boat,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 176/353than hemp. Hemp is a dusky , dark fellow , a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a
golden-haired Circassian to behold. The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"At first sight, you
would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one and fifty yarns
will each suspend a weight of one hundr ed and twenty pounds; so that the whole
rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons. In length, the common sperm
whale-line measures  something over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of
the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still
though, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded
“sheaves,” or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the
“heart,” or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese. As the least
tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take somebody’ s
arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in
its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this
business, carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a
block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible
wrinkles and twists. In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line being
continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in this; because these
twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat, and do not strain it
so much; whereas, the American tub, nearly three feet in diameter and of
proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are
but one half-inch in thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critica l
ice, which  will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a
concentrated one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the American
line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding-
cake to present to the whales. Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an eye-splice
or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub, and hanging over
its edge completely disengaged from everything. This arrangement of the lowe r
end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order to facilitate the fastening to it of
an additio nal line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should
sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the
harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale, as it
were, from the one boat to the other; though the first boat always hovers at hand
to assist its consort . Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common
safety’ s sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat,
and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single,
smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed
boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea;
and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again. Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is taken aft
from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again carried forward
the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every
man’ s oar, so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing; and also passing between
the men, as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or
grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewe r
the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it
hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat again ;
and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being coiled upon the box in
the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and is then
attached to the short-warp—the rope which is immediately connected with the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 177/353harpoon; but previous to that connexio n, the short-warp goes through sundry
mystifications too tedious to detail. Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils, twisting and
writhing around it in almost every direc tion. All the oarsmen are involved in its
perilous contortions ; so that to the timid eye of the landsman, they seem as
Indian jugglers, with the deadliest snake s sportively festooning their limbs. Nor
can any son of mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen
intricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any
unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible contortions be
put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus circumstanced without a
shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken
jelly. Yet habit—strange thing! what cannot habit accomplish?—Gayer sallies,
more merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never heard over
your maho gany , than you will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale -
boat, when thus hung in hangman’ s nooses; and, like the six burghers of Calai s
before King Edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of
death, with a halter around every neck, as you may say . Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those
repeated whaling disasters—some few of which are casually chronicled—of this
man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost. For, when the
line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is like being seated in the midst
of the manifold whizzings of a steam- engine in full play, when every flying
beam, and shaft, and wheel, is grazin g you. It is worse; for you cannot sit
motionless in the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle ,
and you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest warning; and
only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and
action, can you escape being made a Mazeppa of, and run away with where the
all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out. Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies
of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself; for, indeed, the calm is
but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and contains it in itself, as the
seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder , and the ball, and the explosion;
so the graceful repose of the line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen
before being brought into actual play—this is a thing which carries more of true
terror than any other aspect of this dang erous affair. But why say more? All men
live envelo ped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but it
is only when caugh t in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the
silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life. And if you be a philosopher , though
seated in the whale- boat, you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror ,
than though seated before your evening fire with a poker , and not a harpoon, by
your side. CHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a
Whale. If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid  was a thing of portents, to Queequeg
it was quite a dif ferent object.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 178/353“When you see him ’quid,” said the savage, honing his harpoon in the bow of
his hoisted boat, “then you quick see him ’parm whale.”
The next day was exceedingly still and sultry , and with nothing special to
engage them, the Pequod’ s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by
such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we then were
voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground; that is, it affords fewe r
glimpses of porpoises, dolphins, flying -fish, and other vivacious denizens of
more stirring waters , than those off the Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground
off Peru. It was my turn to stand at the foremast -head; and with my shoulders leaning
against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an
enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in that dreamy mood losing all
consciousness, at last my soul went out of my body; though my body still
continued to sway as a pendulum will, long after the power which first moved it
is withdrawn. Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the seamen at
the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy . So that at last all three of
us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every swing that we made there was a
nod from below from the slumbering helmsman. The waves, too, nodded their
indolent crests; and across the wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and
the sun over all. Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my
hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved me; with
a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not forty fathoms off, a
gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate ,
his broad,  glossy back, of an Ethiopian  hue, glistening in the sun’s rays like a
mirror . But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea, and ever and anon
tranquilly spouting his vapory jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher
smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck by some  enchanter ’s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all
at once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts
of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted forth the
accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling
brine into the air . “Clear away the boats! Luff!” cried Ahab. And obeying his own order , he
dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes. The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere
the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the leeward, but
with such a steady tranquillity , and making so few ripples as he swam, that
thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave orders that not an
oar should be used, and no man must  speak but in whispers. So seated like
Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but silently paddled
along; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set. Presently , as we
thus glided in chase, the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into
the air , and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up. “There go flukes!” was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by
Stubb’ s producing his match and igniting  his pipe, for now a respite was granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the whale rose again, and
being now in advance of the smoker ’s boat, and much nearer to it than to any of
the others , Stubb counted upon the honor of the capture. It was obvious, now,
that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers. All silence of
cautiousness was therefore no longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 179/353came loudly into play. And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to
the assault. Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy , he was
going “head out”; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he
brewed.*
*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire
interior of the sperm  whale’ s enormous head consists. Though apparently the
most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about him. So that with ease he
elevates it in the air, and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed . Besides, such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head, and such
the tapering cut-water formation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating
his head, he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed
sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat. “Start her, start her, my men!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Don’ t hurry yourselves; take plenty of time—
but start her; start her like thunder -claps, that’s all,” cried Stubb, spluttering out
the smoke  as he spoke. “Start her, now; give ’em the long and strong stroke ,
Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy—start her, all; but keep cool, keep cool—
cucumbers is the word—easy , easy—only start her like grim death and grinning
devils, and raise the buried dead perpen dicular out of their graves, boys—that’ s
all. Start her!”
“Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!” screamed the Gay-Header in reply , raising some old
war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily
bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian
gave. But his wild scream s were answered by others quite as wild. “Kee-hee! Kee-
hee!” yelle d Daggoo , straining forwards and backwards on his seat, like a pacing
tiger in his cage. “Ka-la! Koo-loo!” howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a mouthful
of Grenadier ’s steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea. Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still encouraged his men to the
onset, all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth. Like desperadoes they
tugged and they strained, till the welcom e cry was heard—“Stand up, Tashtego ! —give it to him!” The harpoon was hurled. “Stern all!” The oarsmen backed
water; the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of
their wrists. It was the magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught
two additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its
increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with
the steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round and round the
loggerhead; so also, just before reaching  that point, it blisteringly passed through
and through both of Stubb’ s hands, from which the hand-cloths, or squares of
quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times, had accidentally dropped. It was
like holding an enemy’ s sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all
the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch. “Wet the line! wet the line!” cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him seated by the
tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into it.* More turns were
taken, so that the line began holding its place. The boat now flew through the
boiling water like a shark all fins. Stubb and Tashtego here changed places—
stem for stern—a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion. *Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be stated, that, in
the old Dutch fisher y, a mop was used to dash the running line with water; in
many other ships, a wooden piggin, or bailer, is set apart for that purpose. Your
hat, however , is the most convenient.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 180/353From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the
boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you would have
thought the craft had two keels—one cleaving the water , the other the air—as
the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once. A continua l
cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake; and, at the
slightest motion from within, even but of a little finger , the vibrating, cracking
craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each
man with might and main clinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the
foam; and the tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double ,
in order to bring down his centre of gravity . Whole Atlantics and Pacifics
seemed passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat
slackened his flight. “Haul in—haul in!” cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round towards
the whale,  all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while yet the boat was
being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly planting his knee in
the clums y cleat, darted dart after dart into the flying fish; at the word of
command, the boat alternately sterning  out of the way of the whale’ s horrible
wallow , and then ranging up for another fling. The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which bubbled and seethed
for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun playing upon this crimson
pond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every face, so that they all glowed to
each other like red men. And all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was
agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff
from the mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his
crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again and again,
by a few rapid blow s against the gunwale, then again and again sent it into the
whale. “Pull up— pull up!” he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale
relaxed in his wrath . “Pull up!—close to!” and the boat ranged along the fish’s
flank. When reachin g far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned his long sharp
lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully churning and churning, as if
cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have
swallowed, and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out. But
that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish. And now it is
struck; for, starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his
“flurry ,” the monster horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped himself in
impenetrable, mad, boiling spray , so that the imperilled craft, instantly dropping
astern, had much ado blindly to struggle  out from that phrensied twilight into the
clear air of the day . And now abating in his flurry , the whale once more rolled out into view;
surging from side to side; spasmodically  dilating and contracting his spout-hole,
with sharp, cracking, agonized respirat ions. At last, gush after gush of clotted
red gore, as if it had been the purple lees of red wine, shot into the frighted air;
and falling back again, ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea. His
heart had burst!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"“He’ s dead, Mr . Stubb,” said Daggoo. “Yes; both pipes smoked out!” and withdrawing his own from his mouth,
Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood
thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 181/353CHAPTER 62. The Dart. A word concerning an incident in the last chapter . According to the invariable usage of the fishery , the whale-boat pushes off
from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary steersman, and
the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling  the foremost oar, the one known as the
harpooneer -oar. Now it needs a strong, nervous arm to strike the first iron into
the fish; for often, in what is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be
flung to the distan ce of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and
exhausting the chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the
uttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the
rest, not only by incredible rowing , but by repeated loud and intrepid
exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one’s compass, while
all the other muscles are strained and half started—what that is none know but
those who have tried it. For one, I cannot bawl very heartily and work very
recklessly at one and the same time. In this straining, bawling state, then, with
his back to the fish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry
—“Stand up, and give it to him!” He now has to drop and secure his oar, turn
round on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with what
little stren gth may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale. No
wonder , taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body , that out of fifty fair
chances for a dart, not five are succe ssful; no wonder that so many hapless
harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated; no wonder that some of them
actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm
whalemen are absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship
owners, whaling is but a losing concern ; for it is the harpooneer that makes the
voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it
there when most wanted! Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant, that is,
when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to
running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else. It is then they chan ge places; and the headsman, the chief officer of the little
craft, takes his proper station in the bows of the boat. Now , I care not who maintains the contrary , but all this is both foolish and
unnecessary . The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last; he should
both dart the harpoo n and the lance, and no rowing whatever should be expected
of him, except unde r circumstances obvious to any fisherman. I know that this
would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience
in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast
majority of failures in the fishery , it has not by any means been so much the
speed of the whale as the before describ ed exhaustion of the harpooneer that has
caused them. To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this world
must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out of toil. CHAPTER 63. The Cr otch.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

subjects, grow the chapters.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The crotch  alluded to on a previous page  deserves independent mention. It is a
notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which is
perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow, for the
purpose of furnishin g a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon, whose
other naked, barbed end slopingly proje cts from the prow . Thereby the weapon
is instantly at hand to its hurler , who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a
backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall. It is customary to have two
harpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively called the first and second irons. But these two harpo ons, each by its own cord, are both connected with the
line; the object being this: to dart them  both, if possible, one instantly after the
other into the same whale; so that if, in the coming drag, one should draw out,
the other may still retain a hold. It is a doubling of the chances. But it very often
happens that owing to the instantaneo us, violent, convulsive running of the
whale upon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer ,
however lightning-l ike in his moveme nts, to pitch the second iron into him. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line, and the line
is running, hence that weapon must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of
the boat, somehow  and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would
involve all hands. Tumbled into the water , it accordingly is in such cases; the
spare coils  of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in
most instances, prudently practicable. But this critical act is not always
unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties. Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard,
it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror , skittishly curvetting abou t
both boat and whale, entangling the lines, or cutting them, and making a
prodigious sensation  in all directions. Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it
again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse. Consider , now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one
unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these qualities in
him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious
enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about
him. For, of course,  each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to
the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery . All these
particulars are faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate several
most important, however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be painted.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"CHAPTER 64. Stubb’ s Supper . Stubb’ s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a calm; so,
forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow business of towing the
trophy to the Pequo d. And now, as we eighteen men with our thirty-six arms ,
and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour
upon that inert, sluggish corpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all,
except at long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the
enormousness of the mass we moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or
whatever they call it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will draw a6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 183/353bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this grand argosy we
towed heavily for ged along, as if laden with pig-lead in bulk. Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod’ s main-rigging
dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab dropping one of several
more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a
moment, he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night, and then
handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way into the cabin, and did not come
forward again until morning. Though, in overseein g the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had evinced his
customary activity , to call it so; yet now that the creature was dead, some vague
dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair , seemed working in him; as if the sight
of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though
a thousand other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot
advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought from
the sound on the Pequod’s decks, that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in
the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck, and thrust rattling
out of the port-holes. But by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the
ship, is to be moored. Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows ,
the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel’ s and seen through the
darkness of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two—ship
and whale , seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines
while the other remains standing.*
*A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most reliable
hold which  the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside, is by the flukes
or tail; and as from  its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any
other (excepting the side-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low
beneath the surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in
order to put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a
small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end, and a weight
in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By adroit management
the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now
having girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit; and being
slipped along the body , is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at
the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes. If moody Ahab was now all quiescence , at least so far as could be known on
deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an unusual but
still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid
Starbuck, his official superior , quietly resigned to him for the time the sole
management of affairs. One small, helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb,
was soon made strangely manifest. Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat
intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate. “A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut me one
from his small!”
Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general thing,
and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray the current
expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage), yet
now and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for
that particular part of the Sperm Whal e designated by Stubb; comprising the
tapering extremity of the body . About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two lanterns of
sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan-head, as
if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on whale’ s6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 184/353flesh that night. Mingling their mumblings with his own mastications, thousand s
on thousands of sharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted
on its fatness. The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the
sharp slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the sleepers ’
hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them (as before you heard them )
wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and turning over on their backs as they
scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous. How at such an
apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical
mouthfuls, remains a part of the univers al problem of all things. The mark they
thus leave on the whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter
in countersinking for a screw . Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks will
be seen longingly gazing up to the ship’s decks, like hungry dogs round a table
where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every killed man that is
tossed to them; and though, while the valiant butchers over the deck-table are
thus canni bally carving each other ’s live meat with carving-knives all gilded and
tasselled, the sharks, also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely
carving away under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the
whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing, that is to
say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties; and though sharks also
are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic, systematically
trotting alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a
dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or two other like instances
might be set down, touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks
do most socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no
conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless
numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm whale ,
moored by night to a whaleship at sea. If you have never seen that sight, then
suspend your decision about the propriety of devil-worship, and the expediency
of conciliating the devil.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumb lings of the banquet that was going on
so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean
lips. “Cook, cook!—where’ s that old Fleece?” he cried at length, widening his legs
still further , as if to form a more secure base for his supper; and, at the same
time darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing with his lance; “cook, you
cook!—sail this way , cook!”
The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously roused
from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came shambling along
from his galley , for, like many old blacks, there was something the matter with
his knee-pans, which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans; this old
Fleece, as they called him, came shuffling and limping along, assisting his step
with his tongs, which, after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron
hoops; this old Ebony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of
command, came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb’ s sideboard; when ,
with both hands folded before him, and resting on his two-legged cane, he
bowed his arched back still further over, at the same time sideways inclining his
head, so as to bring his best ear into play . “Cook,” said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth,
“don’ t you think this steak is rather overdone?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

too much, cook; it’s too tender . Don’ t I always say that to be good, a whale-steak

"Cook, go and talk to
’em; tell ’em they are welcome to help themselves civilly , and in moderation,
but they must keep quiet. Blast me, if I can hear my own voice.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Away, cook, and
deliver my message. Here, take this lantern,” snatching one from his sideboard;
“now then, go and preach to ’em!”
Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck to the
bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over the sea, so as to
get a good  view of his congregation, with the other hand he solemnly flourished
his tongs, and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing
the sharks, while Stubb, softly crawling behind, overheard all that was said. “Fellow-critters: I’se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise
dare. You hear? Stop dat dam smackin’  ob de lip! Massa Stubb say dat you can
fill your dam bellie s up to de hatchings, but by Gor! you must stop dat dam
racket!”
“Cook,” here interpo sed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden slap on
the shoulder ,—“Coo k! why, damn your eyes, you mustn’ t swear that way when
you’re preaching. That’ s no way to convert sinners, cook!”
“Who dat? Den preach to him yourself,” sullenly turning to go. “No, cook; go on, go on.”
“Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:”—
“Right!” exclaimed Stubb, approvingly , “coax ’em to it; try that,” and Fleece
continued. “Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you, fellow-
critters, dat dat woraciousness—’ top dat dam slappin’  ob de tail! How you tink
to hear , spose you keep up such a dam slappin’  and bitin’  dare?”
“Cook,” cried Stubb , collaring him, “I won’ t have that swearing. Talk to ’em
gentlemanly .”
Once more the sermon proceeded. “Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don’t blame ye so much for; dat is
natur , and can’t be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur , dat is de pint. You is
sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in you, why den you be angel; for all
angel is not’ing more dan de shark well goberned. Now , look here, bred’ren, just

but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small bellies; so dat de brigness of de
mout is not to swall er wid, but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks,

“Well done, old Fleece!” cried Stubb, “that’ s Christianity; go on.”
“No use goin’  on; de dam willains will keep a scougin’  and slappin’  each oder,

sleep on de coral, and can’ t hear not’ing at all, no more, for eber and eber .”
“Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the benediction,
Fleece, and I’ll away to my supper .”
Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his shrill
voice, and cried—6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

“Now , cook,” said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; “stand just
where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay particular attention.”
“All dention,” said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in the desired
position.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"“Well,” said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; “I shall now go back to
the subject of this steak. In the first place, how old are you, cook?”
“What dat do wid de ’ teak,” said the old black, testily . “Silence! How old are you, cook?”
“’Bout ninety , dey say ,” he gloomily muttered. “And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook, and
don’t know  yet how to cook a whale-steak?” rapidly bolting another mouthful at
the last word, so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question. “Where
were you born, cook?”
“’Hind de hatchway , in ferry-boat, goin’  ober de Roanoke.”
“Born in a ferry-boa t! That’ s queer , too. But I want to know what country you
were born in, cook!”
“Didn’ t I say de Roanoke country?” he cried sharply . “No, you didn’ t, cook; but I’ll tell you what I’m coming to, cook. You must
go home and be born over again; you don’t know how to cook a whale-steak
yet.”
“Bress my soul, if I cook noder one,” he growled, angrily , turning round to
depart. “Come back, cook;—here, hand me those tongs;—now take that bit of steak
there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be? Take it, I say”—
holding the tongs towards him—“take it, and taste it.”
Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro
muttered, “Best cooked ’ teak I eber taste; joosy , berry joosy .”
“Cook,” said Stubb, squaring himself once more; “do you belong to the
church?”
“Passed one once in Cape-Down,” said the old man sullenly . “And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-T own, where
you doubt less overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved
fellow-creatures, have you, cook! And yet you come here, and tell me such a
dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?” said Stubb. “Where do you expect to go to,
cook?”
“Go to bed berry soon,” he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke. “Avast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It’s an awful question. Now
what’ s your answer?”
“When dis old brack  man dies,” said the negro slowly , changing his whole air
and demeanor , “he hisself won’ t go nowhere; but some bressed angel will come
and fetch him.”
“Fetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah? And fetch him
where?”
“Up dere,” said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and keeping
it there very solemnly . “So, then, you expec t to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when you are
dead? But don’t you know the higher you climb, the colder it gets? Main-top,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

“Didn’ t say dat t’all,” said Fleece, again in the sulks. “You said up there, didn’ t you?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"and now look yourself, and see where your
tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling
through the lubber ’s hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don’t get there, except
you go the regular way, round by the rigging. It’s a ticklish business, but must be
done, or else it’s no go. But none of us are in heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook ,
and hear my orders . Do ye hear? Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t’othe r

"aloft!—that’ s it—now you have it. Hold it
there now , and pay attention.”
“All ’dention,” said the old black, with both hands placed as desired, vainly
wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front at one and the same
time. “Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad, that I
have put it out of sight as soon as possib le; you see that, don’t you? Well, for the
future, when you cook another whale-steak for my private table here, the
capstan, I’ll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing. Hold the steak
in one hand, and show a live coal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d’ye
hear? And now to-m orrow , cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure you
stand by to get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle. As for the ends of the
flukes, have them soused, cook. There, now ye may go.”
But Fleece had hardly got three paces of f, when he was recalled. “Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch. D’ye
hear? away you sail, then.—Halloa! stop! make a bow before you go.—A vast
heaving again! Whale-balls for breakfast—don’ t forget.”
“Wish, by gor! whal e eat him, ’stead of him eat whale. I’m bressed if he ain’t
more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,” muttered the old man, limping away;
with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock. CHAPTER 65.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Whale as a
Dish. That mort al man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and, like
Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so outlandish a thing
that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it. It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale was
esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large prices there. Also ,
that in Henry VIIIth ’s time, a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome
reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises ,
which, you remember , are a species of whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day
considered fine eating. The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard
balls, and being well seasoned and spice d might be taken for turtle-balls or veal
balls. The old monk s of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great
porpoise grant from the crown. The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all hands be
considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but when you come to6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 188/353sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long, it takes away your
appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays partake of
cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious. We all know how they
live upon whales, and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda,
one of their most famous doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as
being exceedingly juicy and nourishi ng. And this reminds me that certain
Englishmen, who long ago were accid entally left in Greenland by a whaling
vessel—that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps
of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber . Among the
Dutch whalemen these scraps are calle d “fritters”; which, indeed, they greatly
resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam
housewives’  dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh. They have such an eatable
look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands of f. But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his exceeding
richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be delicately good. Look
at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the buffalo’s (which is esteemed a
rare dish), were it not such a solid pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how
bland and creamy that is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a
cocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute
for butter . Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into
some other substance, and then partaki ng of it. In the long try watches of the
night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the huge
oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many a good supper have I thus made. In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish. The
casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump, whitish lobes
being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings), they are then mixed
with flour , and cooked into a most delectable mess, in flavor somewha t
resembling calves’  head, which is quite a dish among some epicures; and every
one know s that some young bucks among the epicures, by continually dining
upon calves’  brains, by and by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be
able to tell a calf’s head from their own heads; which, indeed, require s
uncommon discrimi nation. And that is the reason why a young buck with an
intelligent looking calf’s head before him, is somehow one of the saddest sights
you can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at him, with an “Et tu
Brute!” expression. It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that
landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence; that appears to
result, in some way, from the consider ation before mentioned: i.e. that a man
should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light. But
no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer ;
perhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly
would have been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the
meat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at
the long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight take a tooth out of the
cannibal’ s jaw? Cannibals? who is not a cannibal? I tell you it will be more
tolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a
coming famine; it will be more tolerab le for that provident Fejee, I say, in the
day of judgment, than for thee, civilized  and enlightened gourmand, who nailest
geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy paté-de-foie-gras. But Stubb , he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is adding
insult to injury , is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my civilized and
enlightened gourma nd dining off that roast beef, what is that handle made of?—
what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating? And what do6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars? It is only within
the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing

"The Shark
Massacr e. When in the Southern Fishery , a capture d Sperm Whale, after long and weary
toil, is brought alongside late at night , it is not, as a general thing at least,
customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in. For that business
is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very soon completed; and requires all
hands to set about it. Therefore, the common usage is to take in all sail; lash the
helm a’lee ; and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight, with the
reservation that, until that time, anchor -watches shall be kept; that is, two and
two for an hour, each couple, the crew  in rotation shall mount the deck to see
that all goes well. But some times, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will not
answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the moored
carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a stretch, little more than the
skeleton would be visible by morning. In most other parts of the ocean, however ,
where these fish do not so largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at
times considerably diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp
whaling-spades, a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only
seems to tickle them into still greater activity . But it was not thus in the present
case with the Pequod’ s sharks; though, to be sure, any man unaccustomed to
such sight s, to have looked over her side that night, would have almost thought
the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in it. Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor -watch after his supper was
concluded; and when, accordingly , Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on
deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for immediately
suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering three lanterns, so that
they cast long gleam s of light over the turbid sea, these two mariners, darting
their long whaling-spades, kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks,* by
striking the keen steel deep into their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But
in the foam y confus ion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could
not always hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the
incredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at each other ’s
disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and bit their own; till
those entra ils seeme d swallowed over and over again by the same mouth, to be
oppositely voided by the gaping woun d. Nor was this all. It was unsafe to
meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures. A sort of generic or
Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones, after what
might be called the individual life had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck for
the sake of his skin,  one of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg’ s hand off,
when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw .6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

the bignes s of a man’ s spread hand; and in general shape, corresponds to the
garden implement after which it is named; only its sides are perfectly flat, and its
upper end considerably narrower than the lower . This weapon is always kept as
sharp as possible; and when being used is occasionally honed, just like a razor . In its socket, a stif f pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle. “Queequeg no care what god made him shark,” said the savage, agonizingly
lifting his hand up and down; “wedder Fejee god or Nantucket god; but de god
wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.”
CHAPTER 67. Cutting In. It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio professors
of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was turned into what
seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher . You would have thought we were
offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods. In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous things
comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and which no single man
can possibly lift—this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main-top and
firmly lashed to the lower mast-head,  the strongest point anywhere above a
ship’ s deck. The end of the hawser -like rope winding through these intricacies ,
was then conducted to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was
swung over the whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one
hundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the side,
Starbuck and Stubb , the mates, armed with their long spades, began cutting a
hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two
side-fins. This done, a broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is
inserted, and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now
commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly , the
entire ship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads of
an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her frighted
mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to the whale, while every
gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows ;
till at last, a swift, startling snap is heard; with a great swash the ship rolls
upwards and backwards from the whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into
sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of
blubber . Now as the blubber envelopes  the whale precisely as the rind does an
orange, so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes
stripped by spiraliz ing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the windlas s
continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water , and as the
blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the “scarf,”
simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the mates; and just as
fast as it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very act itself, it is all the time
being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top; the
men at the windlass then cease heaving,  and for a moment or two the prodigious
blood-dripping mass  sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one
present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it may box his ears
and pitch him headlong overboard.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 191/353One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon
called a boarding-sw ord, and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a
considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into this hole, the end
of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon
the blubber , in order to prepare for what  follows. Whereupon, this accomplished
swordsman, warning  all hands to stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at
the mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it
completely in twain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long uppe r
strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear , and is all ready for lowering. The
heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is peeling and
hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly slackened away , and
down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath, into an
unfurnished parlor called the blubber -room. Into this twilight apartment sundry
nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live
mass of plaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting
and lower ing simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the heaver s
singing, the blubber -room gentlemen coiling, the mates scarfing, the ship
straining, and all hands swearing occasionally , by way of assuaging the general
friction. CHAPTER 68. The Blanket. I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin of the
whale. I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat, and
learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion remains unchanged; but it is only
an opinion. The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you know
what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence of firm, close-
grained beef, but tougher , more elastic and compact, and ranges from eight or
ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness. Now , however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature’ s skin
as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point of fact these are no
arguments against such a presumption; because you cannot raise any other dense
enveloping layer from the whale’ s body but that same blubber; and the
outermost enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be
but the skin? True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape
off with your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewha t
resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and soft
as satin; that is, previous to being dried,  when it not only contracts and thickens ,
but becom es rather hard and brittle. I have several such dried bits, which I use
for marks in my whale-books. It is transparent, as I said before; and being laid
upon the printed page, I have sometimes  pleased myself with fancying it exerted
a magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to read about whales through
their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I am driving at here is this. That
same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I admit, invests the entire body
of the whale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature, as the
skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper
skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new-
born child. But no more of this.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 192/353Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin, as in
the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels
of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity , or rather weight, that oil, in its
expressed state, is only three fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat;
some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere
part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning
ten barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters
of the stuf f of the whale’ s skin. In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many
marvels he presents . Almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re-
crossed with numbe rless straight marks in thick array , something like those in
the finest Italian line engravings. But these marks do not seem to be impressed
upon the isinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as
if they were engrave d upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some instances, to
the quick,  observan t eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but
afford the ground for far other delineati ons. These are hieroglyphical; that is, if
you call those myste rious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then
that is the proper word to use in the present connexion. By my retentive memory
of the hieroglyphics  upon one Sperm Whale in particular , I was much struck
with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the famous
hieroglyphic palisad es on the banks of the Upper Mississippi. Like those mystic
rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable. This allusion to
the Indian rocks reminds me of another  thing. Besides all the other phenomena
which the exterior of the Sperm Whal e presents, he not seldom displays the
back, and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linea r
appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular ,
random aspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the sea-coast,
which Agassiz imag ines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast
floating iceber gs—I should say, that those rocks must not a little resemble the
Sperm Whale in this particular . It also seems to me that such scratches in the
whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales; for I have most
remarked them in the lar ge, full-grown bulls of the species. A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the
whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long pieces, called
blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy and significant. For
the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane;
or, still better , an Indian poncho slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity . It
is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body , that the whale is enabled to keep
himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides. What would
become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy seas of the North, if
unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other fish are found exceedingly brisk in
those Hyperborean waters; but these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded,
lungless fish, whose very bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that warm
themselves under the lee of an iceber g, as a traveller in winter would bask before
an inn fire; whereas, like man, the whal e has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his
blood, and he dies. How wonderful is it then—except after explanation—tha t
this great monster , to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man;
how wond erful that he should be found at home, immersed to his lips for life in
those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall overboard, they are sometimes
found, months afterwards, perpendicula rly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice,
as a fly is found glued in amber . But more surprising is it to know , as has been
proved by experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a
Borneo negro in summer .6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

vitality , and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare virtue of interio r
spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself after the whale! Do thou, too,
remain warm among ice. Do thou, too, live in this world without being of it. Be
cool at the equator; keep thy blood fluid at the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter ’s, and like the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of
thine own.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections, how
few are domed like St. Peter ’s! of creatures, how few vast as the whale! CHAPTER 69. The Funeral. “Haul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!”
The vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the
beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue, it has
not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal. Slowly it floats more and
more away , the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks, and the
air above vexed with rapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like
so many insulting poniards in the whale. The vast white headless phantom floats
further and further from the ship, and every rod that it so floats, what seem
square roods of sharks and cubic roods  of fowls, augment the murderous din. For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen. Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face of the pleasant sea,
wafted by the joyous breezes, that great  mass of death floats on and on, till lost
in infinite perspectives. There’ s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures all in
pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled. In life but
few of them would  have helped the whale, I ween, if peradventure he had
needed it; but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce. Oh,
horrible vultureism of earth! from which not the mightiest whale is free. Nor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost survives and
hovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war or blundering
discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls,
nevertheless still shows the white mass  floating in the sun, and the white spray
heaving high against it; straightway the whale’ s unharming corpse, with
trembling fingers is set down in the log— shoals, rocks, and breakers
hereabouts: bewar e! And for years afterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place;
leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum, because their leader originally
leaped there when a stick was held. There’s your law of precedents; there’ s your
utility of traditions; there’ s the story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs
never bottomed on the earth, and now not even hovering in the air! There’ s
orthodoxy! Thus, while in life the great whale’ s body may have been a real terror to his
foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world. Are you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts than the Cock-
Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe in them.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 194/353CHAPTER 70. The Sphynx. It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body
of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now , the beheading of the Sperm Whale is a
scientific anatomica l feat, upon which experienced whale surgeons very much
pride themselves: and not without reason. Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck; on the
contrary , where his head and body seem to join, there, in that very place, is the
thickest part of him. Remember , also, that the surgeon must operate from above,
some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject, and that subject
almost hidden in a discoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting
sea. Bear in mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut
many feet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner , without so much
as getting  one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus made, he must
skilfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly divide the spine
at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull. Do you not marvel, then, at
Stubb’ s boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale? When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till
the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck
to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a full grown leviathan this is
impossible; for the sperm whale’ s head embraces nearly one third of his entire
bulk, and completel y to suspend such a burden as that, even by the immense
tackles of a whaler , this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch
barn in jewellers’  scales. The Pequo d’s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head was
hoisted against the ship’ s side—about half way out of the sea, so that it might
yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And there with the strained
craft steeply leaning over to it, by reaso n of the enormous downward drag from
the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm on that side projecting like a crane
over the waves; there, that blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod’ s waist like
the giant Holofernes’ s from the girdle of Judith. When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went
below to their dinner . Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now
deserted deck. An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow lotus, was more
and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea. A short space elapse d, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from
his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter -deck, he paused to gaze over the
side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took Stubb’ s long spade—stil l
remaining there after the whale’ s decapitation—and striking it into the lower
part of the half-suspended mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm,
and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head. It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so intense a
calm, it seemed the Sphynx’ s in the desert. “Speak, thou vast and venerable
head,” muttered Ahab, “which, though ungarnished with a beard, yet here and
there lookest hoary with mosses; speak,  mighty head, and tell us the secret thing
that is in thee. Of all divers, thou hast dived the deepest. That head upon which
the upper sun now gleams, has moved  amid this world’ s foundations. Where
unrecorded names and navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in
her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the
drowned; there, in that awful water -land, there was thy most familiar home .6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

side, wher e sleeples s mothers would give their lives to lay them down. Thou
saw’st the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart
they sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other , when heaven seemed
false to them. Thou saw’st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the
midnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw;
and his murderers still sailed on unharmed—while swift lightnings shivered the
neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched,
longing arms. O head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an
infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!”
“Sail ho!” cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head. “Aye? Well, now, that’s cheering,” cried Ahab, suddenly erecting himself,
while whole thunder -clouds swept aside from his brow . “That lively cry upon
this deadly calm might almost convert a better man.—Where away?”
“Three points on the starboard bow , sir, and bringing down her breeze to us! “Better and better , man. Would now St. Paul would come along that way, and
to my breezelessness bring his breeze! O Nature, and O soul of man! how far
beyond all utterance  are your linked analogies! not the smallest atom stirs or
lives on matter , but has its cunning duplicate in mind.”
CHAPTER 71. The Jer oboam’ s
Story . Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than the
ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock. By and by, through  the glass the stranger ’s boats and manned mast-heads
proved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and shooting by,
apparently making a passage to some other ground, the Pequod could not hope
to reach her . So the signal was set to see what response would be made. Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships of the
American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which signals being
collected in a book  with the names of the respective vessels attached, every
captain is provided with it. Thereby , the whale commanders are enabled to
recognise each other upon the ocean, even at considerable distances and with no
small facility . The Pequo d’s signa l was at last responded to by the stranger ’s setting her
own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket. Squaring her
yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod’ s lee, and lowered a boat;
it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck’ s order
to accommodate the visiting captain, the stranger in question waved his hand
from his boat’ s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary . It
turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that
Mayhew , her captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod’ s company . For,
though himself and boat’ s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was half
a rifle-sho t off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between; yet
conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily
refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 196/353But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an interval
of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam’ s boat by the
occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the Pequod, as she heavily
forged through the sea (for by this time it blew very fresh), with her main-topsail
aback; though, indeed, at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the
boat would be pushed some way ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to
her proper bearings again. Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now
and then, a conversa tion was sustained between the two parties; but at intervals
not without still another interruption of a very dif ferent sort. Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam’ s boat, was a man of a singular appearance,
even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities . He was a small, short, youngish man, sprinkled all over his face with freckles ,
and wearing redundant yellow hair.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a
faded waln ut tinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled
up on his wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes. So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had exclaimed—“That’ s
he! that’s he!—the long-togged scaram ouch the Town-Ho’ s company told us
of!” Stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the Jeroboam, and a certain
man among her crew , some time previou s when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to this account and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the
scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almos t
everybody in the Jeroboam. His story was this:
He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna
Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret meetings
having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trap-door ,
announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he carried in his vest-
pocket; but, which, instead of contai ning gunpowder , was supposed to be
charged with laudanum. A strange, apostolic whim having seized him, he had
left Nesky euna for Nantucket, where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he
assumed a steady , common-sense exterior , and offered himself as a green-hand
candidate for the Jeroboam’ s whaling voyage. They engaged him; but
straightway upon the ship’ s getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in
a freshet. He annou nced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded the
captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby he set himself
forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar -general of all Oceanica. The unflin ching earnestness with which he declared these things;—the dark,
daring play of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all the preternatural terror s
of real delirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the
ignorant crew , with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover , they were afraid of
him. As such a man, however , was not of much practical use in the ship,
especially as he refused to work except when he pleased, the incredulous captain
would fain have been rid of him; but apprised that that individual’ s intention was
to land him in the first convenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his
seals and vials—dev oting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in
case this intention was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his disciple s
among the crew , that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if
Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain. He was
therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel to be any
way maltr eated, say or do what he would; so that it came to pass that Gabriel
had the complete freedom of the ship. The consequence of all this was, that the
archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates; and since the
epidemic had broken out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the
plague, as he called  it, was at his sole command; nor should it be stayed but6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 197/353according to his good pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and
some of them fawn ed before him; in obedience to his instructions, sometime s
rendering him personal homage, as to a god. Such things may seem incredible;
but, however wondrous, they are true. Nor is the history of fanatics half so
striking in respect to the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his
measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to
return to the Pequod. “I fear not thy epidemic, man,” said Ahab from the bulwarks, to Captain
Mayhew , who stood in the boat’ s stern; “come on board.”
But now Gabriel started to his feet. “Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the horrible
plague!”
“Gabriel! Gabriel!” cried Captain Mayhew; “thou must either—” But that
instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings drowned all
speech. “Hast thou seen the White Whale?” demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted
back. “Think, think of thy whale-boat, stove n and sunk! Beware of the horrible
tail!”
“I tell thee again, Gabriel, that—” But again the boat tore ahead as if dragged
by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a succession of riotous
waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were
tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the hoisted sperm whale’ s head jogged
about very violently , and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more
apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant. When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning
Moby Dick; not, however , without frequent interruptions from Gabriel,
whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with
him. It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking a
whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby Dick ,
and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this intelligence, Gabrie l
solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale, in case the
monster should be seen; in his gibbering  insanity , pronouncing the White Whale
to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the
Bible. But when, some year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted
from the mast-heads, Macey , the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounte r
him; and the captain  himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity ,
despite all the archangel’ s denunciations and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in
persuading five men to man his boat. With them he pushed off; and, after much
weary pulling, and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in
getting one iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head ,
was tossing one arm in frantic gestures , and hurling forth prophecies of speedy
doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity . Now , while Macey , the mate,
was stand ing up in his boat’ s bow, and with all the reckless energy of his tribe
was ventin g his wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair
chance for his poise d lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its
quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the
oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten
bodily into the air, and making a long arc in his descent, fell into the sea at the
distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of
any oarsman’ s head; but the mate for ever sank.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 198/353It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the Sperm-Whale
Fishery , this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any. Sometimes, nothing is
injured but the man who is thus annihil ated; oftener the boat’ s bow is knocked
off, or the thigh-boa rd, in which the headsman stands, is torn from its place and
accompanies the body . But strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more
instances than one, when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of
violence is discernible; the man being stark dead. The whole  calamity , with the falling form of Macey , was plainly descried
from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek—“The vial! the vial!” Gabriel called off
the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of the whale. This terrible event
clothed the archangel with added influence; because his credulous disciples
believed that he had specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a
general prophecy , which any one might  have done, and so have chanced to hit
one of many marks in the wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror to
the ship. Mayhew having concluded his narration , Ahab put such questions to him, that
the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the
White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which Ahab answered—“A ye.”
Straightway , then, Gabriel once more started to his feet, glaring upon the old
man, and vehemently exclaimed, with downward pointed finger—“Think, think
of the blasphemer—dead, and down there!—beware of the blasphemer ’s end!”
Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew , “Captain, I have just
bethought me of my letter -bag; there is a letter for one of thy officers, if I
mistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag.”
Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships,
whose delivery to the persons to whom  they may be addressed, depends upon
the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans. Thus, most letters
never reach their mark; and many are only received after attaining an age of two
or three years or more. Soon Starb uck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely tumbled, damp,
and covere d with a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence of being kept in a
dark locker of the cabin. Of such a letter , Death himself might well have been
the post-boy . “Can’ st not read it?” cried Ahab.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"“Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it’s but a dim
scrawl;—what’ s this?” As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a long cutting-
spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to insert the letter there, and
in that way , hand it to the boat, without its coming any closer to the ship. Meantime, Ahab holding the letter , muttered, “Mr. Har—yes, Mr. Harry—(a
woman’ s pinny hand,—the man’ s wife, I’ll wager)—A ye—Mr . Harry Macey ,
Ship Jeroboam;—why it’ s Macey , and he’ s dead!”
“Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,” sighed Mayhew; “but let me
have it.”
“Nay , keep it thyself,” cried Gabriel to Ahab; “thou art soon going that way .”
“Curses throttle thee!” yelled Ahab. “Captain Mayhew , stand by now to
receive it”; and taking the fatal missive  from Starbuck’ s hands, he caught it in
the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boat. But as he did so, the
oarsmen expectantly  desisted from rowing; the boat drifted a little towards the
ship’ s stern; so that, as if by magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with
Gabriel’ s eager hand. He clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and
impaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab’ s
feet. Then  Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars, and
in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild af fair. CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope. In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there is
much running backwards and forwards among the crew . Now hands are wanted
here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one
place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is
much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"We must
now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in
the whale’ s back, the blubber -hook was inserted into the original hole there cut
by the spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that
same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend
Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer , to descend upon the monster ’s
back for the special purpose referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances
require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or
stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely
submer ged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some
ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on
the whale and half in the water , as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mil l
beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland
costume—a shirt and socks—in which  to my eyes, at least, he appeared to
uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as will
presently be seen. Being the savage’ s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar in his
boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him
while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale’ s back. You have
seen Italia n organ-boys holding a danci ng-ape by a long cord. Just so, from the
ship’ s steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is
technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of
canvas belted round his waist. It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we proceed
further , it must be said that the monk ey-rope was fast at both ends; fast to
Queequeg’ s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather one. So that for
better or for worse , we two, for the time, were wedded; and should poor
Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honor demanded, that
instead of cutting the cord, it should drag me down in his wake. So, then, an
elongated Siamese ligature united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin
brother; nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the
hempen bond entailed. So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that while
earnestly watching his motions, I seem ed distinctly to perceive that my own
individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two; that my free will
had received a mortal wound; and that another ’s mistake or misfortune migh t
plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here
was a sort of interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could
have so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked him
now and then from between the whale  and ship, which would threaten to jam6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 200/353him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the
precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way
or other , has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If your
banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your
pills, you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly
escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle
Queequeg’ s monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I
came very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I
would, I only had the management of one end of it.*
*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod that
the monkey and his holder were ever tied together . This improvement upon the
original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in order to afford the
imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and
vigilance of his monkey-rope holder . I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale
and the ship—where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant rolling and
swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night, the sharks now
freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow
from the carcass—the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive. And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them aside
with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted
by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark
will seldom touch a man. Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous
finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them. Accordingly ,
besides the monkey -rope, with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow
from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark
—he was provided with still another protection. Suspended over the side in one
of the stages, Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a
couple of keen whale-spades, wherewi th they slaughtered as many sharks as
they could  reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and
benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg’ s best happiness, I admit; but in their
hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both he and the
sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water , those indiscreet
spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail. But poor
Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook—
poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life into the
hands of his gods. Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother , thought I, as I drew in and
then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters it, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those sharks, your foes; those
spades, your friends; and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle
and peril, poor lad. But courag e!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"there is good cheer in store  for you, Queequeg. For now, as with
blue lips and blood- shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chain s
and stands all dripping and involuntari ly trembling over the side; the steward
advances, and with a benevolent, conso latory glance hands him—what? Some
hot Cognac?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"No! hands him, ye gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and
water!6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 201/353“Ginger? Do I smel l ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near. “Yes,
this must be ginger ,” peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then standing as if
incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the astonished steward
slowly saying, “Ginger? ginger? and will you have the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy , where lies the virtue of ginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel
you use, Dough-boy , to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!—what
the devil is ginger? Sea-coal? firewood?—lucifer matches?—tinder?—
gunpowder?—what the devil is ginger , I say, that you offer this cup to our poor
Queequeg here.”
“There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this business,”
he sudden ly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just come from
forward. “Will you look at that kannak in, sir: smell of it, if you please.” Then
watching the mate’ s countenance, he added, “The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the
face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale . Is the steward an apothecary , sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters
by which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?”
“I trust not,” said Starbuck, “it is poor stuf f enough.”
“Aye, aye, steward,” cried Stubb, “we’ll teach you to drug a harpooneer; none
of your apothecary’ s medicine here; you want to poison us, do ye? You have got
out insura nces on our lives and want to murder us all, and pocket the proceeds ,
do ye?”
“It was not me,” cried Dough-Boy , “it was Aunt Charity that brought the
ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits, but only
this ginger -jub—so she called it.”
“Ginger -jub! you gingerly rascal!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"take that! and run along with ye to the
lockers, and get something better . I hope I do no wrong, Mr.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Starbuck. It is the
captain’ s orders—grog for the harpooneer on a whale.”
“Enough,” replied Starbuck, “only don’ t hit him again, but—”
“Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of that
sort; and this fellow’ s a weazel. What were you about saying, sir?”
“Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.”
When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort of
tea-caddy in the other . The first contained strong spirits, and was handed to
Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity’ s gift, and that was freely given to the
waves. CHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask
kill a Right Whale; and Then Have
a Talk over  Him. It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale’ s
prodigious head hanging to the Pequod’ s side. But we must let it continue
hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it. For the present
other matters press, and the best we can do now for the head, is to pray heaven
the tackles may hold.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 202/353Now , during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually drifted
into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit, gave unusual tokens
of the vicinity of Right Whales, a specie s of the Leviathan that but few supposed
to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near. And though all hands
commonly disdaine d the capture of those inferior creatures; and though the
Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all, and though she had
passed numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that
a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all,
the announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if
opportunity of fered. Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two boats,
Stubb’ s and Flask’ s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further and further away ,
they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast-head. But suddenly in
the distanc e, they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water , and soon after
news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast. An interval passed
and the boats were in plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the
ship by the towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first
it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom,
within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from view , as if diving
under the keel. “Cut, cut!” was the cry from the ship to the boats, which, for one
instant, seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the
vessel’ s side. But having plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not
sounding very rapidly , they paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time
pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the
struggle was intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened line
in one direction, and still plied their oars in another , the contending strain
threatened to take them under . But it was only a few feet advance they sought to
gain. And they stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly , a swift tremor was
felt running like lightning along the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath
the ship, suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so
flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the
water , while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were
free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering his
course, went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him, so that
they performed a complete circuit. Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close flanking him
on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance; and thus round and
round the Pequod the battle went, while the multitudes of sharks that had before
swum round the Sperm Whale’ s body , rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled ,
thirstily drinking at every new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new
bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock. At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he turned
upon his back a corpse. While the two heads men were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes, and
in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some conversation
ensued between them. “I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,” said Stubb,
not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a
leviathan. “Wants with it?” said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat’ s bow, “did
you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale’ s head hoisted
on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right Whale’ s on the larboard; did
you never hear , Stubb, that that ship can never afterwards capsize?”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 203/353“Why not? “I don’t know, but I heard that gamboge  ghost of a Fedallah saying so, and he
seems to know all about ships’  charms. But I sometimes think he’ll charm the
ship to no good at last. I don’t half like that chap, Stubb. Did you ever notice
how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake’ s head, Stubb?”
“Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a dark night,
and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look down there, Flask”—
pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands—“A ye, will I! Flask, I
take that Fedallah to be the devil in disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull
story about his having been stowed away on board ship? He’s the devil, I say. The reason why you don’t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he
carries it coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of it,
he’s always wanting oakum to stuf f into the toes of his boots.”
“He sleeps in his boots, don’t he? He hasn’ t got any hammock; but I’ve seen
him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.”
“No doubt, and it’s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye see, in
the eye of the rigging.”
“What’ s the old man have so much to do with him for?”
“Striking up a swap or a bar gain, I suppose.”
“Bargain?—about what?”
“Why , do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and the
devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away his silver
watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then he’ll surrender Moby
Dick.”
“Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?”
“I don’t know , Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked one, I tell
ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag-ship once,
switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old
governor was at home. Well, he was at home, and asked the devil what he
wanted. The devil, switching his hoofs, up and says, ‘I want John.’  ‘What for?’
says the old govern or. ‘What business is that of yours,’  says the devil, getting
mad,—‘I want to use him.’  ‘Take him,’ says the governor—and by the Lord,
Flask, if the devil didn’t give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through with
him, I’ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look sharp—ain’ t you all ready
there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let’ s get the whale alongside.”
“I think I remember some such story as you were telling,” said Flask, when at
last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship,
“but I can’ t remember where.”
“Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes? Did
ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?”
“No: neve r saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me, Stubb, do
you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was the same you say
is now on board the Pequod?”
“Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn’ t the devil live for
ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any parson a
wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a latch-key to get into the
admiral’ s cabin, don’t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole? Tell me that,
Mr. Flask?”
“How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 204/353“Do you see that mainmast there?” pointing to the ship; “well, that’s the
figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod’ s hold, and string along in a
row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that wouldn’ t begin to be
Fedallah’ s age. Nor all the coopers in creation couldn’ t show hoops enough to
make oughts enough.”
“But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you meant to
give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now , if he’s so old as all
those hoop s of yours come to, and if he is going to live for ever, what good will
it do to pitch him overboard—tell me that? “Give him a good ducking, anyhow .”
“But he’d crawl back.”
“Duck him again; and keep ducking him.”
“Suppose he should take it into his head  to duck you, though—yes, and drown
you—what then?”
“I should like to see him try it; I’d give him such a pair of black eyes that he
wouldn’ t dare to show his face in the admiral’ s cabin again for a long while, let
alone down in the orlop there, where he lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks
where he sneaks so much. Damn the devil, Flask; so you suppose I’m afraid of
the devil? Who’ s afraid of him, except the old governor who daresn’ t catch him
and put him in doub le-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping
people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil kidnapped ,
he’d roast for him? There’ s a governor!”
“Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?”
“Do I suppose it? You’ll know it before  long, Flask. But I am going now to
keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious going on, I’ll
just take him by the nape of his neck, and say—Look here, Beelzebub, you don’t
do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord I’ll make a grab into his pocket for
his tail, take it to the capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that
his tail will come short off at the stump—do you see; and then, I rather guess
when he finds hims elf docked in that queer fashion, he’ll sneak off without the
poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.”
“And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?”
“Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;—what else?”
“Now , do you mean what you say , and have been saying all along, Stubb?”
“Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.”
The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where fluke
chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him. “Didn’ t I tell you so?” said Flask; “yes, you’ll soon see this right whale’ s head
hoisted up opposite that parmacetti’ s.”
In good time, Flask’ s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply leaned
over towa rds the sperm whale’ s head, now, by the counterpoise of both heads,
she regain ed her even keel; though sorely strained, you may well believe. So,
when on one side you hoist in Locke’ s head, you go over that way; but now, on
the other side, hoist in Kant’ s and you come back again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep trimming boat.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

this, in the present case, had been done. The carcases of both whales had
dropped astern; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a
pair of overburdening panniers. Meantime, Fedallah  was calmly eyeing  the right whale’ s head, and ever and
anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand. And

them, concerning all these passing things.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"CHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale’ s
Head—Contrasted View. Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us join them,
and lay together our own. Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale
are by far the most noteworthy . They are the only whales regularly hunted by
man. To the Nantu cketer , they present the two extremes of all the known
varieties of the whale. As the external difference between them is mainly
observable in their heads; and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the
Pequod’ s side; and as we may freely go from one to the other , by merely
stepping across the deck:—where, I should like to know , will you obtain a better
chance to study practical cetology than here? In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these heads. Both are massive enough in all conscie nce; but there is a certain mathematical
symmetry in the Sperm Whale’ s which the Right Whale’ s sadly lacks. There is
more character in the Sperm Whale’ s head. As you behold it, you involuntarily
yield the immense superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity . In the
present instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of
his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In
short, he is what the fishermen technically call a “grey-headed whale.”
Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely , the two most
important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the head, and low
down, near the angle of either whale’ s jaw, if you narrowly search, you will at
last see a lashless eye, which you would fancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out of
all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head. Now , from  this peculiar sideway position of the whale’ s eyes, it is plain that
he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more than he can one
exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale’ s eyes corresponds to that of
a man’s ears; and you may fancy , for yourself, how it would fare with you, did
you sideways survey objects through your ears. You would find that you could
only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line
of sight; and about thirty more behind  it. If your bitterest foe were walking
straight towards you, with dagger uplifte d in broad day, you would not be able to
see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind. In a word, you
would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side
fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man—what, indeed, but his eyes?6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 206/353Moreover , while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes are so
planted as impercep tibly to blend their visual power , so as to produce one
picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of the whale’ s eyes,
effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head, which tower s
between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of
course, must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ
imparts. The whale , therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side, and
another distinct picture on that side; while all between must be profound
darkness and nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the
world from  a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window . But with the
whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two distinct windows ,
but sadly impairing the view . This peculiarity of the whale’ s eyes is a thing
always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader in
some subsequent scenes. A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual
matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a hint. So long as a
man’ s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing is involuntary; that is, he
cannot then help mechanically seein g whatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one’s experience will teach him, that though he can take in an
undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him,
attentively , and completely , to examine any two things—however large or
however small—at one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side
by side and touch each other . But if you now come to separate these two objects,
and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of
them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will be
utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness. How is it, then, with
the whale? True, both his eyes, in thems elves, must simultaneously act; but is his
brain so much more  comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man’ s, that he
can at the same mom ent of time attentiv ely examine two distinct prospects, one
on one side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he can, then
is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able simultaneously to go
through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Nor, strictly
investigated, is there any incongruity in this comparison. It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the
extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset
by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer frights, so common to
such whales; I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity
of volition , in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision
must involve them. But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an entire
stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for hours, and neve r
discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf whatever; and into the hole
itself you can hardly insert a quill, so wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little
behind the eye. With respect to their ears, this important difference is to be
observed between the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has
an externa l opening,  that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a
membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without. Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the world
through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller
than a hare’ s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of Herschel’ s great
telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals; would that make
him any longer of sight, or sharper of hearing? Not at all.—Why then do you try
to “enlar ge” your mind? Subtilize it.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

over the sperm whale’ s head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending by a
ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not that the body
is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we might descend into the
great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But let us hold on here by this
tooth, and look about us where we are.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"What a really beautiful and chaste-
looking mouth! from  floor to ceiling, lined, or rather papered with a glistening
white membrane, glossy as bridal satins. But come out now , and look at this portentous lower jaw , which seems like the
long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one end, instead of
one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead, and expose its rows of teeth, it
seems a terrific portcullis; and such, alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the
fishery , upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is
it to behol d, when fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating
there suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging
straight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a ship’ s jib-
boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of sorts, perhaps;
hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed, leaving
him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a reproach to all his tribe, who must, no
doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon him. In most cases this lower jaw—being easily unhinged by a practised artist—is
disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth, and
furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen
fashion all sorts of curious articles, including canes, umbrella-stocks, and
handles to riding-whips. With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an anchor;
and when  the proper time comes—so me few days after the other work—
Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished dentists, are set to
drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spad e, Queequeg lances the gums; then the
jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being rigged from aloft, they drag
out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood
lands. There are generally forty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn
down, but undecaye d; nor filled after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterward s
sawn into slabs, and piled away like joists for building houses. CHAPTER 75. The Right Whale’ s
Head—Contrasted View. Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale’ s
head. As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale’ s head may be compared to a
Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly rounded); so, at a
broad view , the Right Whale’ s head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a
gigantic galliot-toed  shoe. Two hundred years ago an old Dutch voyager likened
its shape to that of a shoemaker ’s last. And in this same last or shoe, that old
woman of the nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be
lodged, she and all her progeny .6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 208/353But as you come nearer to this great  head it begins to assume different
aspects, according to your point of view . If you stand on its summit and look at
these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole head for an enormous
bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its sounding-board. Then, again, if
you fix your eye upon this strange, crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of
the mass—this green, barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the “crown,”
and the Southern fishers the “bonnet” of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes
solely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak, with a
bird’ s nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle
here on this bonnet , such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you; unless,
indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term “crown” also bestowed
upon it; in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty
monster is actually a diademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put
together for him in this marvellous manner . But if this whale be a king, he is a
very sulky  looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower lip!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter ’s measurement ,
about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and pout that will yield you
some 500 gallons of oil and more. A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The
fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an important interval
was sailin g down the Peruvian coast, when earthquakes caused the beach to
gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery threshold, we now slide into the mouth . Upon my word were I at Mackinaw , I should take this to be the inside of an
Indian wigwam. Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah went? The roof is about
twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regula r
ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us with those
wondrous, half vertical, scimetar -shape d slats of whalebone, say three hundred
on a side, which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone, form
those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned. The
edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres, through which the Right
Whale strains the water , and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish, when
openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time. In the centra l
blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural order , there are certain curious
marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the
creature’ s age, as the age of an oak by its circular rings. Though the certainty of
this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical
probability . At any rate, if we yield to it, we must grant a far greater age to the
Right Whale than at first glance will seem reasonable. In old times, there seem to have prevaile d the most curious fancies concerning
these blind s. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous “whiskers” inside
of the whale’ s mouth;* another , “hogs’  bristles”; a third old gentleman in
Hackluyt uses the following elegant language: “There are about two hundred
and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper chop , which arch over his
tongue on each side of his mouth.”
*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker , or rather a
moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the
outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish
expression to his otherwise solemn countenance. As every one knows , these same “hogs’  bristles,” “fins,” “whiskers,” “blinds,”
or whatev er you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening
contrivances. But in this particular , the demand has long been on the decline. It
was in Queen Anne’ s time that the bone was in its glory , the farthingale being
then all the fashion. And as those ancient dames moved about gaily , though in6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 209/353the jaws of the whale, as you may say; even so, in a shower , with the like
thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the
umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone. But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and, standing in
the Right Whale’ s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all these colonnades of
bone so methodically ranged about, would you not think you were inside of the
great Haar lem organ, and gazing upon its thousand pipes? For a carpet to the
organ we have a rug of the softest Turkey—the tongue, which is glued, as it
were, to the floor of the mouth. It is very fat and tender , and apt to tear in piece s
in hoisting it on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I
should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that amount of oil. Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with—that the
Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have  almost entirely different heads. To sum
up, then: in the Right Whale’ s there is no great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at
all; no long, slender mandible of a lower  jaw, like the Sperm Whale’ s. Nor in the
Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and
scarcely anything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external spout-
holes, the Sperm Whale only one. Look your last, now, on these venerab le hooded heads, while they yet lie
together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other will not be very
long in following. Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale’ s there? It is the same he
died with,  only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded
away . I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like placidity , born of a
speculative indifference as to death. But mark the other head’ s expression. See
that amazing lower lip, pressed by accident against the vessel’ s side, so as firmly
to embrace the jaw. Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormou s
practical resolution in facing death? This Right Whale I take to have been a
Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in his
latter years. CHAPTER 76. The Battering-
Ram. Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale’ s head, I would have you, as a
sensible physiologist, simply—particularly remark its front aspect, in all its
compacted collectedness. I would have you investigate it now with the sole view
of formin g to yourself some unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whateve r
battering-ram power  may be lodged there. Here is a vital point; for you must
either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an infide l
as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true events, perhaps anywhere to
be found in all recorded history . You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale, the
front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water; you
observe that the lower part of that front  slopes considerably backwards, so as to
furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom-like lowe r
jaw; you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head, much in the same
way, indeed, as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 210/353Moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose
he has—his spout hole—is on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes and
ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his entire length from the
front. Wherefore, you must now have  perceived that the front of the Sperm
Whale’ s head is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender prominence
of any sort whatsoever . Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the
extreme, lower , backward sloping part of the front of the head, is there the
slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead
do you come to the full cranial deve lopment. So that this whole enormou s
boneless mass is as one wad. Finally , though, as will soon be revealed, its
contents partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised of
the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent
effeminacy . In some previous place I have described to you how the blubber
wraps the body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange. Just so with the head;
but with this difference: about the head this envelope, though not so thick, is of a
boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who has not handled it. The
severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm,
impotently rebounds from it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale
were paved with horses’  hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it. Bethink yourself also of another thing . When two large, loaded Indiamen
chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the sailors
do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming contact, any
merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold there a large, round wad
of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox-hide. That bravely
and uninj ured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken
handspikes and iron crow-bars.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"By itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious
fact I drive at. But supplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me,
that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them,
capable, at will, of distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I
know , has no such provision in him; considering, too, the otherwise inexplicable
manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface, and
anon swim s with it high elevated out of the water; considering the unobstructed
elasticity of its envelope; considering the unique interior of his head; it has
hypothetically occur red to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled honeycombs
there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion
with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and
contraction. If this be so, fancy the irresistibleness of that might, to which the
most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Now , mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable wall,
and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a mass of
tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is—by the cord;
and all obedient to one volition, as the smallest insect. So that when I shall
hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency
everywhere lurking in this expansive monster; when I shall show you some of
his more inconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all
ignorant incredulity , and be ready to abide by this; that though the Sperm Whale
stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed the Atlantic with the
Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your eye-brow . For unless you own
the whale, you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is
a thing for salamand er giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the
provincials then? What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess’ s veil

Heidelburgh Tun.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
Now comes the Baling of the Case.,"Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"But to comprehend it aright, you must
know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon. Regarding the Sperm Whale’ s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an inclined
plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower is the bony
structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an unctuous mass wholly
free from bones; its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent
forehead of the whale. At the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this
upper quoin, and then you have two almost equal parts, which before were
naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance. *Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belon gs to the pure nautical mathematics. I
know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a solid which differs from a
wedge in having its sharp end formed  by the steep inclination of one side,
instead of the mutual tapering of both sides. The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of oil,
formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand infiltrated cells, of
tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent. The upper part, known as
the Case, may be regarded as the great Heidelbur gh Tun of the Sperm Whale . And as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front, so the whale’ s vast
plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical
adornment of his wondrous tun. Moreo ver, as that of Heidelbur gh was alway s
replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the
tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages ;
namely , the highly-prized spermaceti , in its absolutely pure, limpid, and
odoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other
part of the creature. Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure
to the air, after death, it soon begin s to concrete; sending forth beautifu l
crystalline shoots, as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water . A
large whale’ s case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though
from unav oidable circumstances, consid erable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles
away , or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what
you can. I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelbur gh Tun was coated
within, but in superl ative richness that coating could not possibly have compared
with the silken pearl-coloured membr ane, like the lining of a fine pelisse,
forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale’ s case. It will have been seen that the Heidelbur gh Tun of the Sperm Whale embraces
the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since—as has been elsewhere
set forth—the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature, then
setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale, you have more
than twenty-six feet for the depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up
and down against a ship’ s side. As in decapitating the whale, the operat or’s instrument is brought close to the
spot where  an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine; he
has, theref ore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless, untimely stroke should6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

decapitated end of the head, also, which is at last elevated out of the water , and
retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen
combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter . Thus much  being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and—in this
particular instance—almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm Whale’ s great
Heidelbur gh Tun is tapped. CHAPTER 78.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Cistern and
Buckets. Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect posture,
runs straig ht out upon the overhangin g mainyard-arm, to the part where it
exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried with him a light tackle
called a whip, consisting of only two parts, travelling through a single-sheaved
block. Securing this block, so that it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings
one end of the rope, till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then,
hand-over -hand, down the other part, the Indian drops through the air, till
dexterously he lands on the summit of the head. There—still high elevated
above the rest of the company , to whom  he vivaciously cries—he seems some
Turkish Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower . A
short-handled sharp  spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for the
proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business he proceeds very
heedfully , like a treasure-hunter in some old house, sounding the walls to find
where the gold is masoned in. By the time this cautious search is over, a stout
iron-bound bucket, precisely like a well-bucket, has been attached to one end of
the whip; while the other end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by
two or three alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the
Indian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole. Inserting this
pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun, till it
entirely disappears; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip, up comes
the bucke t again, all bubbling like a dairy-maid’ s pail of new milk. Carefully
lowered from its height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand,
and quick ly emptie d into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes
through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the
end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder , and deeper and deeper
into the Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down. Now , the people of the Pequod had been  baling some time in this way; several
tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once a queer acciden t
happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild Indian, was so heedless and
reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold on the great cabled
tackles suspending the head; or whether the place where he stood was so
treacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out
so, without stating his particular reasons; how it was exactly , there is no telling
now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up—
my God! poor Tashtego—like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well,
dropped head-forem ost down into this great Tun of Heidelbur gh, and with a
horrible oily gur gling, went clean out of sight!6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 213/353“Man overboard!” cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first
came to his senses. “Swing the bucket this way!” and putting one foot into it, so
as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip itself, the hoisters ran
him high up to the top of the head, almost before Tashtego could have reached
its interior bottom. Meantime, there was a terrible tumult. Looking over the side,
they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of
the sea, as if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was
only the poor India n unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous
depth to which he had sunk. At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing the
whip—which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles—a sharp
cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all, one of the two
enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a vast vibration the
enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if
smitten by an iceber g. The one remain ing hook, upon which the entire strain
now depended, seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way; an event
still more likely from the violent motions of the head. “Come down, come  down!” yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand
holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he would still
remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line, rammed down the
bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the buried harpooneer should
grasp it, and so be hoisted out. “In heaven’ s name, man,” cried Stubb, “are you ramming home a cartridge
there?—A vast! How  will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket on top
of his head? Avast, will ye!”
“Stand clear of the tackle!” cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket. Almost in the same instant, with a thund er-boom, the enormous mass dropped
into the sea, like Niagara’ s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the suddenly relieved
hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering copper; and all caught their
breath, as half swinging—now over the sailors’  heads, and now over the water—
Daggoo, through a thick mist of spray , was dimly beheld clinging to the
pendulous tackles, while poor , buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to
the bottom of the sea! But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away , when a
naked figure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen
hovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my brave
Queequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the side, and
every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment, and no sign of
either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands now jumped into a boat
alongside, and pushed a little of f from the ship. “Ha! ha!” cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch
overhead; and looking further off from  the side, we saw an arm thrust upright
from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust forth from the grass
over a grave. “Both! both!—it is both!”—cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout; and soon
after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and with the other
clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the waiting boat, they were
quickly brought to the deck; but Tashteg o was long in coming to, and Queequeg
did not look very brisk. Now , how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why , diving after the
slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunge s
near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then dropping his sword, had
thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards, and so hauled out poor Tash by the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 214/353head. He averred, that upon first thrust ing in for him, a leg was presented; but
well knowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great
trouble;—he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had
wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in
the good old way—head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was doing as
well as could be expected. And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg, the
deliverance, or rather , delivery of Tashtego, was successfully accomplished, in
the teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments;
which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the
same course with fencing and boxing, riding and rowing. I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header ’s will be sure to seem
incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have either seen or
heard of some one’s falling into a cistern ashore; an accident which not seldom
happens, and with much less reason too than the Indian’ s, considering the
exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale’ s well. But, perad venture, it may be sagaciousl y urged, how is this? We thought the
tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and most corky
part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific
gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at all, but I have ye; for at the time
poor Tash fell in, the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents ,
leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well—a double welded,
hammered substance, as I have before said, much heavier than the sea water , and
a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking in
this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other
parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it sank very slowly and
deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg  a fair chance for performing his agile
obstetrics on the run, as you may say . Yes, it was a running delivery , so it was. Now , had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious
perishing; smothere d in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti;
coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum
sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be recalled—the
delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunte r, who seeking honey in the crotch of a
hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that leaning too far over, it sucked
him in, so that he died embalmed. How many , think ye, have likewise fallen into
Plato’ s honey head, and sweetly perished there? CHAPTER 79.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Prairie. To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this Leviathan;
this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for Lavater to have
scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar , or for Gall to have mounted a

his, Lavater not only treats of the various faces of men, but also attentively
studies the faces of horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon
the modifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his
disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenologica l
characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore, though I am but ill qualified6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 215/353for a pioneer , in the application of these two semi-sciences to the whale, I will
do my endeavor . I try all things; I achieve what I can. Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He
has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of
the featur es; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their
combined expression ; hence it would seem that its entire absence, as an external
appendage, must very largely affect the countenance of the whale. For as in
landscape gardening , a spire, cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is
deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene; so no face can be
physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the nose from Phidias’ s marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder! Nevertheless, Levia than is of so mighty a magnitude, all his proportions are so
stately , that the same deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were hideous, in
him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is an added grandeur . A nose to the whale would
have been  impertinent. As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his
vast head in your jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by
the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which so often
will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his
throne. In some particulars,  perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be
had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This aspect is
sublime. In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the
morning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has a touch of
the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles, the elephant’ s brow
is majestic . Human or animal, the mystical brow is as that great golden seal
affixed by the Germ an emperors to their decrees. It signifies—“God: done this
day by my hand.” But in most creatur es, nay in man himself, very often the
brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the
foreheads which like Shakespeare’ s or Melancthon’ s rise so high, and descend
so low, that the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and
all above them in the forehead’ s wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered
thoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow print s
of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like dignity
inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in that full
front view , you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in
beholding any other object in living nature. For you see no one point precisely;
not one distinct featu re is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face; he has
none, proper; nothin g but that one broad firmament of a forehead, pleated with
riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom  of boats, and ships, and men. Nor, in
profile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that way viewed its grandeu r
does not domineer upon you so. In profile, you plainly perceive that horizontal ,
semi-crescentic depression in the forehead’ s middle, which, in man, is Lavater ’s
mark of genius. But how?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a
book, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing nothing
particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence. And this
reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orien t
World, he would have been deified by their child-magian thoughts. They deified
the crocod ile of the Nile, because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm
Whale has no tongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of
protrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure back to
their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and livingly enthrone them6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

to Jove’ s high seat, the great Sperm Whale shall lord it. Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is no
Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man’ s and every being’ s face. Physiognomy , like every other human science, is but a passing fable. If then, Sir

peasant’ s face in its profounder and more subtle meanings, how may unlettered
Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee  of the Sperm Whale’ s brow? I but put

"The Nut. If the Sperm Whale  be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist his
brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square. In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as the side of a
moderately inclined  plane resting throug hout on a level base. But in life—as we
have elsew here seen—this inclined plane is angularly filled up, and almos t
squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm. At the
high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass; while under the
long floor of this crater—in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in
length and as many in depth—reposes the mere handful of this monster ’s brain. The brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden
away behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the amplified
fortifications of Quebec. So like a choic e casket is it secreted in him, that I have
known some whalemen who peremptor ily deny that the Sperm Whale has any
other brain  than that palpable semblance  of one formed by the cubic-yards of his
sperm magazine. Lying in strange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their
apprehensions, it seems more in keepin g with the idea of his general might to
regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence. It is plain , then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in the
creature’ s living intact state, is an entire  delusion. As for his true brain, you can
then see no indicati ons of it, nor feel any. The whale, like all things that are
mighty , wears a false brow to the common world. If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear
end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its resemblance to the human
skull, beheld in the same situation, and from the same point of view . Indeed,
place this reversed skull (scaled down to the human magnitude) among a plate of
men’ s skulls, and you would involuntarily confound it with them; and remarking
the depressions on one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say
—This man had no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations,
considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power , you
can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most exhilarating conception
of what the most exalted potency is. But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale’ s proper brain, you deem
it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea for you. If you
attentively regard almost any quadruped’ s spine, you will be struck with the
resemblance of its vertebræ to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 217/353rudimental resembla nce to the skull proper . It is a German conceit, that the
vertebræ are absolutely undeveloped skulls. But the curious external
resemblance, I take it the Germans were  not the first men to perceive. A foreign
friend once pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with
the vertebræ of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked
prow of his canoe. Now , I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an
important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through
the spinal canal. For I believe that much of a man’ s character will be found
betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel your spine than your skull,
whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I
rejoice in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half
out to the world. Apply this spinal branch of phrenolog y to the Sperm Whale. His cranial
cavity is continuous  with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra the bottom
of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being eight in height, and of a
triangular figure with the base downwa rds. As it passes through the remaining
vertebræ the canal tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of large
capacity . Now , of course, this canal is filled with much the same strangely
fibrous substance—the spinal cord—as the brain; and directly communicates
with the brain. And what is still more, for many feet after emer ging from the
brain’ s cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to
that of the brain. Under all these circu mstances, would it be unreasonable to
survey and map out the whale’ s spine phrenologically? For, viewed in this light,
the wonderful comparative smallness  of his brain proper is more than
compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord. But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I would
merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the Sperm
Whale’ s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one of the larger
vertebræ, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould of it. From its
relative situation then, I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or
indomitableness in the Sperm Whale. And that the great monster is indomitable ,
you will yet have reason to know .","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"CHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets
The Virgin. The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau, Derick De
Deer , master , of Bremen. At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and Germans
are now among the least; but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and
longitude, you still occasionally meet with their flag in the Pacific. For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects. While
yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a boat, her
captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the bows instead of the
stern. “What has he in his hand there?” cried Starbuck, pointing to something
wavingly held by the German. “Impossible!—a lamp-feeder!”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 218/353“Not that,” said Stubb, “no, no, it’s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he’s coming
off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don’t you see that big tin can there
alongside of him?—that’ s his boiling water . Oh! he’ s all right, is the Yarman.”
“Go along with you,” cried Flask, “it’s a lamp-feeder and an oil-can. He’s out
of oil, and has come a-begging.”
However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the
whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb
about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing really happens ;
and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp -
feeder as Flask did declare. As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all heeding
what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German soon evinced his
complete ignorance of the White Whal e; immediately turning the conversation
to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some remarks touching his having to turn
into his hammock at night in profound darkness—his last drop of Bremen oil
being gone, and not a single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency;
concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically
called a clean  one (that is, an empty one), well deser ving the name of Jungfrau
or the Virgin. His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his ship’ s
side, when whales were almost simulta neously raised from the mast-heads of
both vesse ls; and so eager for the chase  was Derick, that without pausing to put
his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed round his boat and made after the
leviathan lamp-feeders. Now , the game having risen to leeward,  he and the other three German boats
that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the Pequod’ s keels. There
were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their danger , they were going all
abreast with great speed straight before the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely
as so many spans of horses in harness. They left a great, wide wake, as though
continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea. Full in this rapid wake, and many fatho ms in the rear, swam a huge, humped
old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as by the unusua l
yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted with the jaundice, or
some other infirmity . Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance,
seemed questionable; for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be
at all social. Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water
must have  retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle
was a dashed one, like the swell forme d when two hostile currents meet. His
spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of gush ,
and spending itself in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotion s
in him, which seem ed to have egress at his other buried extremity , causing the
waters behind him to upbubble. “Who’ s got some paregoric?” said Stubb, “he has the stomach-ache, I’m
afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse winds are
holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It’s the first foul wind I ever knew to blow
from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before? it must be, he’s lost his
tiller.”
As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load
of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her way; so did this
old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly turning over on his
cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 219/353of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost that fin in battle, or had been born
without it, it were hard to say . “Only wait a bit, old chap, and I’ll give ye a sling for that wounded arm,”
cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him. “Mind he don’t sling thee with it,” cried  Starbuck. “Give way, or the German
will have him.”
With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish,
because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most valuable whale, but
he was nearest to them, and the other whales were going with such great
velocity , moreover , as almost to defy pursuit for the time. At this juncture the
Pequod’ s keels had shot by the three German boats last lowered; but from the
great start he had had, Derick’ s boat still led the chase, though every moment
neared by his foreig n rivals. The only thing they feared, was, that from being
already so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron before they
could completely overtake and pass him. As for Derick, he seemed quite
confident that this would be the case, and occasionally with a deriding gesture
shook his lamp-feeder at the other boats. “The ungracious and ungrateful dog!” cried Starbuck; “he mocks and dares
me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes ago!”—then in his
old intense whisper—“Give way , greyhounds! Dog to it!”
“I tell ye what it is, men”—cried Stubb to his crew—“it’ s against my religion
to get mad; but I’d like to eat that villainous Yarman—Pull—won’ t ye? Are ye
going to let that rascal beat ye? Do ye love brandy? A hogshead of brandy , then,
to the best man. Come, why don’t some of ye burst a blood-vessel? Who’ s that
been dropp ing an anchor overboard—we don’t budge an inch—we’re becalmed . Halloo, here’s grass  growing in the boat’ s bottom—and by the Lord, the mast
there’ s budding. This won’ t do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long
of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?”
“Oh! see the suds he makes!” cried Flask, dancing up and down—“What a
hump—Oh, do pile on the beef—lays like a log! Oh! my lads, do spring—slap-
jacks and quahogs for supper , you know , my lads—baked clams and muffins—
oh, do, do, spring,—he’ s a hundred barreller—don’ t lose him now—don’ t oh,
don’t!—see that Yarman—Oh, won’ t ye pull for your duff, my lads—such a sog! such a sogger! Don’ t ye love sperm?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"There goes three thousand dollars, men!—a
bank!—a whole bank! The bank of England!—Oh, do, do, do!—What’ s that
Yarman about now?”
At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the
advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of retarding
his rivals’ way, and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the
momentary impetus of the backward toss. “The unmannerly Dutch dogger!” cried Stubb.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"“Pull now, men, like fifty
thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What d’ye say, Tashtego ;
are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces for the honor of old
Gayhead? What d’ye say?”
“I say , pull like god-dam,”—cried the Indian. Fiercely , but evenly  incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod’ s three
boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed, momentarily neared
him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near
to his prey, the three mates stood up proudly , occasionally backing the after
oarsman with an exhilarating cry of, “There she slides, now! Hurrah for the
white-ash breeze! Down with the Yarman! Sail over him!”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 220/353But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all their gallantry ,
he would have proved the victor in this race, had not a righteous judgment
descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman . While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white-ash, and while, in
consequence, Derick ’s boat was nigh to capsizing, and he thundering away at his
men in a mighty rage;—that was a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took a mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the
German’ s quarter . An instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the
whale’ s immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was the
foaming swell that he made. It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was now
going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet;
while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright. Now to this hand, now
to that, he yawed in his faltering flight, and still at every billow that he broke, he
spasmodically sank in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one
beating fin. So have  I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken
circles in the air, vainly striving to escap e the piratical hawks. But the bird has a
voice, and with plain tive cries will make known her fear; but the fear of this vast
dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice ,
save that choking respiration through his spiracle, and this made the sight of him
unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and
omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied. Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod’ s boats
the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick chose to hazard
what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart, ere the last chance
would for ever escape. But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three tigers
—Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo—instinctively sprang to their feet, and standing
in a diago nal row, simultaneously point ed their barbs; and darted over the head
of the German harpooneer , their three Nantucket irons entered the whale . Blinding vapors of foam and white-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the
whale’ s headlong rush, bumped the German’ s aside with such force, that both
Derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three
flying keels. “Don’ t be afraid, my butter -boxes,” cried Stubb, casting a passing glance
upon them as he shot by; “ye’ll be picked up presently—all right—I saw some
sharks astern—St. Bernard’ s dogs, you know—relieve distressed travellers . Hurrah!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"this is the way to sail now. Every keel a sunbeam! Hurrah!—Here we go
like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar! This puts me in mind of
fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain—makes the wheel-spokes fly,
boys, when you fasten to him that way; and there’ s danger of being pitched out
too, when  you strike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he’s
going to Davy Jones—all a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this
whale carries the everlasting mail!”
But the monster ’s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he tumultuously
sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round the loggerheads with
such a force as to gouge deep groov es in them; while so fearful were the
harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines, that using all
their dexterous might, they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold
on; till at last—owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of
the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue—the
gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water , while the three sterns
tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for some time they6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 221/353remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more line, though the position
was a little ticklish. But though boats have been taken down and lost in this way,
yet it is this “holding on,” as it is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of
his live flesh from the back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon
rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril of
the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but
reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under water , the
more he is exhausted . Because, owing to the enormous surface of him—in a full
grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet—the pressure of the
water is immense. We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we
ourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then,
the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of
ocean! It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres. One whaleman has
estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and
stores, and men on board. As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down into its
eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any sort, nay, not so much
as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths; what landsman would have
thought, that beneath all that silence and placidity , the utmost monster of the
seas was writhing and wrenching in agony! Not eight inches of perpendicula r
rope were visible at the bows. Seems it credible that by three such thin thread s
the great Leviathan  was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
and to what?,"Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it
was once so triump hantly said—“Canst  thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or
his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the
spear , the dart, nor the haber geon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the arrow cannot
make him flee; darts are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of a
spear!” This the creature? this he?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Oh! that unfulfilments should follow the
prophets. For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run
his head under the mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod’ s fish-
spears! In that sloping aftern oon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats sent down
beneath the surface , must have been long enough and broad enough to shade
half Xerxes’  army . Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have
been such huge phantoms flitting over his head! “Stand by, men; he stirs,” cried Starbuc k, as the three lines suddenly vibrated
in the water, distinc tly conducting upwards to them, as by magnetic wires, the
life and death throbs of the whale, so that every oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows,
the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense
herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea. “Haul in! Haul in!” cried Starbuck again; “he’ s rising.”
The lines,  of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand’ s breadth could
have been  gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the
boats, and soon the whale broke water within two ship’ s lengths of the hunters. His motio ns plainly denoted his extrem e exhaustion. In most land animals
there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby when
wounded, the blood is in some degre e at least instantly shut off in certain
directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it is to have an
entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by
so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole
arterial system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of
water at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to pour from him6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 222/353in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him, and so distant
and numerous its interior fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding
for a considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is
in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats
pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and the
lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from the new
made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his
head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture into
the air. From this last vent no blood yet came, because no vital part of him had
thus far been struck. His life, as they significantly call it, was untouched. As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of his
form, with much of it that is ordinarily submer ged, was plainly revealed. His
eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were beheld. As strange
misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate, so
from the points which the whale’ s eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind
bulbs, horribly pitiable to see. But pity there was none. For all his old age, and
his one arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order
to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate
the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all. Still
rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch
or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the flank. “A nice spot,” cried Flask; “just let me prick him there once.”
“Avast!” cried Starbuck, “there’ s no need of that!”
But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet
shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish,
the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly darted at the craft,
bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore,
capsizing Flask’ s boat and marring the bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this
time, so spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the
wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his
stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up
the white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most piteous, that
last expiri ng spout. As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off
from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the
spray-column lower s and lowers to the ground—so the last long dying spout of
the whale. Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body showed
symptoms of sinking with all its treasu res unrifled. Immediately , by Starbuck’ s
orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so that ere long every boat
was a buoy; the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by
the cords. By very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale
was transf erred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke-
chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the body would at once
sink to the bottom. It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade, the entire
length of a corroded harpoon was found  imbedded in his flesh, on the lower part
of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently
found in the dead bodies of captured whales, with the flesh perfectly healed
around them, and no prominence of any kind to denote their place; therefore,
there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully
to account for the ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a
lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron, the flesh
perfectly firm about it. Who had darted  that stone lance? And when? It migh t6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

discovered. What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet
there is no telling.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries, by the ship’ s
being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea, owing to the body’ s
immensely increasing tendency to sink. However , Starbuck, who had the
ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely , indeed,
that when at length the ship would have been capsized, if still persisting in
locking arms with the body; then, when the command was given to break clear
from it, such was the immovable strain upon the timber -heads to which the
fluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off. Meantime everythin g in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the
deck was like walkin g up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship groaned and
gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started
from their places, by the unnatural dislocation. In vain handspikes and crow s
were brought to bear upon the immovab le fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from
the timberheads; and so low had the whale now settled that the submer ged ends
could not be at all approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity
seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going
over. “Hold on, hold on, won’ t ye?” cried Stubb to the body , “don’ t be in such a
devil of a hurry to sink!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"By thunder , men, we must do something or go for it. No
use prying  there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run one of ye for a
prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains.”
“Knife? Aye, aye,” cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter ’s heavy hatchet,
he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing at the largest fluke-
chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were given, when the exceeding strain
effected the rest. With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship
righted, the carcase sank. Now , this occasiona l inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is
a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy , with its side or belly
considerably elevate d above the surface . If the only whales that thus sank were
old, meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all
their bone s heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that
this sinking is cause d by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking,
consequent upon this absence of buoya nt matter in him. But it is not so. For
young whales, in the highest health,  and swelling with noble aspirations ,
prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of life, with all their panting lard
about them; even these brawny , buoyant heroes do sometimes sink. Be it said, however , that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this accident
than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty Right Whale s
do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the
greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone
sometimes weighing  more than a ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is
wholly free. But there are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or
several days, the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the
reason of this is obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious
magnitude; becomes  a sort of animal balloon.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"A line-of-battle ship could hardly
keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of
New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to
him, with plenty of rope; so that when the body has gone down, they know
where to look for it when it shall have ascended again.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 224/353It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the
Pequod’ s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering her
boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back, belonging to the
species of uncapturable whales, because of its incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back’ s spout is so similar to the Sperm Whale’ s, that by
unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken  for it. And consequently Derick and all
his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding
all sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared far to
leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase. Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend. CHAPTER 82. The Honor  and
Glory of Whaling. There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true
method. The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up to the
very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its great
honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many great demi-
gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other have shed
distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection that I myself belong,
though but subordinately , to so emblazoned a fraternity . The gallan t Perseus, a son of Jupiter , was the first whaleman; and to the
eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale attacked by our
brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent. Those were the knightly days
of our profession, when we only bore arms to succor the distressed, and not to
fill men’s lamp-feeders. Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and
Andromeda; how the lovely Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a
rock on the sea-coas t, and as Leviathan  was in the very act of carrying her off,
Perseus, the prince of whalemen, intrep idly advancing, harpooned the monster ,
and delivered and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit, rarely
achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as this Leviathan
was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the
ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples, there
stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the city’s legends and
all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus
slew. When the Rom ans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in
triumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in this story , is
this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail. Akin to the adventur e of Perseus and Andromeda—indeed, by some supposed
to be indirectly derived from it—is that famous story of St. Geor ge and the
Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in many old
chronicles whales and dragons are stran gely jumbled together , and often stand
for each other . “Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a dragon of the sea,”
saith Ezek iel; hereb y, plainly meaning a whale; in truth, some versions of the
Bible use that word itself. Besides, it would much subtract from the glory of the
exploit had St. Geor ge but encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of
doing battle with the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 225/353only a Perseus, a St. Geor ge, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march boldly up
to a whale. Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the creature
encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffin-
like shape, and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback,
yet consid ering the great ignorance of those times, when the true form of the
whale was unknown to artists; and considering that as in Perseus’  case, St. Geor ge’s whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and
considering that the animal ridden by St. Geor ge might have been only a large
seal, or sea-horse; bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether
incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to
hold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself. In fact,
placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story will fare like that
fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by name; who being planted
before the ark of Israel, his horse’ s head and both the palms of his hands fell off
from him, and only the stump or fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of
our own noble stamp , even a whaleman,  is the tutelary guardian of England; and
by good rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most
noble order of St. Geor ge. And therefore, let not the knights of that honorable
company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do with a whale like
their great  patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain, since even in
our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to St. Geor ge’s decoration than they . Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long remained
dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that antique Crockett
and Kit Carson—that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds, was swallowed
down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether that strictly makes a whaleman of
him, that might be mooted. It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned
his fish, unless, indeed, from the inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort
of involuntary whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the
whale. I claim him for one of our clan. But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of Hercules and
the whale is conside red to be derived from the still more ancient Hebrew story
of Jonah and the whale; and vice versâ; certainly they are very similar . If I claim
the demi-god then, why not the prophet? Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole roll
of our order . Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal kings of old
times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods
themselves. That wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the
Shaster , which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the
godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord;—
Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart
and sanctified the whale. When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster ,
resolved to recreate  the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave
birth to Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books,
whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before
beginning the creation, and which there fore must have contained something in
the shape of practical hints to young architects, these Vedas were lying at the
bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became incarnate in a whale, and sounding
down in him to the uttermost depths, rescued the sacred volumes. Was not this
Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even as a man who rides a horse is called a
horseman?6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 226/353Perseus, St. Geor ge, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there’ s a member -roll for
you! What club but the whaleman’ s can head of f like that? CHAPTER 83. Jonah Historically
Regarded. Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the
preceding chapter . Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of
Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans,
who, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times, equally doubted the
story of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their
doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts ,
for all that. One old Sag-Harbo r whaleman’ s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew
story was this:—He  had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles, embellished
with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented Jonah’ s whale with
two spout s in his head—a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the
Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which
the fishermen have this saying, “A penny roll would choke him”; his swallow is
so very small. But, to this, Bishop Jebb’s anticipative answer is ready . It is not
necessary , hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale’ s
belly , but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this seem s
reasonable enough in the good Bisho p. For truly, the Right Whale’ s mouth
would accommodat e a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the
players. Possibly , too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth;
but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless. Another reason whic h Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his want
of faith in this matte r of the prophet, was something obscurely in reference to his
incarcerated body and the whale’ s gastri c juices. But this objection likewise falls
to the ground, becau se a German exeget ist supposes that Jonah must have taken
refuge in the floatin g body of a dead  whale—even as the French soldiers in the
Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them . Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah
was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape to
another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head; and, I would
add, possibly called “The Whale,” as some craft are nowadays christened the
“Shark,” the “Gull,” the “Eagle.” Nor have there been wanting learned
exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah
merely meant a life-preserver—an inflated bag of wind—which the endangered
prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor ,
therefore, seems worsted all round. But he had still another reason for his want
of faith. It was this, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in
the Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere
within three days’  journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than
three days’  journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast. How is that? But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short
distance of Nineveh ? Yes. He might have carried him round by the way of the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 227/353Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of
the Mediterranean, and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a
supposition would involve the complete  circumnavigation of all Africa in three
days, not to speak of the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too
shallow for any whale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah’ s weathering the
Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of
that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer , and so make
modern history a liar . But all these foolish  arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his foolish
pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing that he had but
little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea. I say it
only show s his foolish, impious pride, and abominable, devilish rebellion agains t
the reverend clergy. For by a Portugu ese Catholic priest, this very idea of
Jonah’ s going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signa l
magnification of the general miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the
highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah. And
some three  centuries  ago, an English traveller in old Harris’ s Voyages, speaks of
a Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which Mosque was a miraculou s
lamp that burnt without any oil. CHAPTER 84.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Pitchpoling. To make them run easily and swiftly , the axles of carriages are anointed; and
for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an analogous operation upon
their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it to be doubted that as such a
procedure can do no harm, it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage;
considering that oil and water are hostil e; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the
object in view is to make the boat slide bravely . Queequeg believed strongly in
anointing his boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau
disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation; crawling unde r
its bottom , where it hung over the side, and rubbing in the unctuousness as
though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft’ s bald keel. He
seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Nor did it
remain unwarranted by the event. Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to
them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered flight, as of
Cleopatra’ s bar ges from Actium. Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb’s was foremost. By great exertion,
Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the stricken whale, without
at all sounding, still continued his horiz ontal flight, with added fleetness. Such
unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably
extract it. It became imperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose
him. But to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and
furious. What then remained? Of all the wondrous devices and dexteri ties, the sleights of hand and countless
subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced, none exceed that
fine manœ uvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small sword, or broad sword ,
in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It is only indispensable with an
inveterate running whale; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 228/353which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat,
under extreme headway . Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or
twelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon, and also
of a lighter material—pine. It is furnish ed with a small rope called a warp, of
considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting. But befor e going further , it is importa nt to mention here, that though the
harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is seldom
done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on account of the greate r
weight and inferior length of the harpoo n as compared with the lance, which in
effect become serious drawbacks. As a general thing, therefore, you must first
get fast to a whale, before any pitchpoling comes into play . Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and
equanimity in the direst emer gencies , was specially qualified to excel in
pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat;
wrapt in fleecy foam , the towing whale  is forty feet ahead. Handling the long
lance lightly , glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly
straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to
secure its free end in his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the
lance full before his waistband’ s middle, he levels it at the whale; when,
covering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand, thereby
elevating the point till the weapon stand s fairly balanced upon his palm, fifteen
feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler , balancing a long staff on his
chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless impulse, in a superb lofty arch the
bright steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale . Instead of sparkling water , he now spouts red blood. “That drove the spigot out of him!” cried Stubb. “’Tis July’ s immortal Fourth;
all fountai ns must run wine today! Would now, it were old Orleans whiskey , or
old Ohio, or unspea kable old Monongahela! Then, Tashtego, lad, I’d have ye
hold a canakin to the jet, and we’d drink round it! Yea, verily , hearts alive, we’d
brew choice punch in the spread of his spout-hole there, and from that live
punch-bowl quaf f the living stuf f.”
Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated, the
spear retur ning to its master like a greyh ound held in skilful leash. The agonized
whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is slackened, and the pitchpoler dropping
astern, folds his hands, and mutely watches the monster die. CHAPTER 85. The Fountain. That for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of ages
before—the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea, and
sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so many sprinkling or
mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back, thousands of hunters should
have been close by the fountain of the whale, watching these sprinklings and
spoutings—that all this should be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute
(fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o’clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of
December , A.D. 1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings
are, after all, really water , or nothing but vapor—this is surely a noteworthy
thing.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 229/353Let us, then, look at this matter , along with some interesting items contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills, the finny tribes in
general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which
they swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live a century , and never once raise
its head above the surface. But owing  to his marked internal structure which
gives him regular lungs, like a huma n being’ s, the whale can only live by
inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for
his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot in any degree breathe
through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm Whale’ s mouth is
buried at least eight feet beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe
has no connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone;
and this is on the top of his head. If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to
vitality , inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element, which being
subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its
vivifying principle, I do not think I shall err; though I may possibly use some
superfluous scientifi c words. Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a
man could  be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not
fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then live without
breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale ,
who systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the
bottom) without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a
particle of air; for, remember , he has no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and
on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan
labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are
completely distende d with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or more, a
thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as
the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for
future use in its four supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this
labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable
and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise
inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out, as the
fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising to the
surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly
uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven minutes, and
jets seventy times, that is, respires seven ty breaths; then whenever he rises again,
he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to a minute. Now , if after
he fetches a few breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always
dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air. And not till those
seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full term below . Remark, however , that in different individuals these rates are different; but in
any one they are alike. Now , why should the whale thus insist upon having his
spoutings out, unless it be to replenish  his reservoir of air, ere descending for
good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the whale’ s rising expose s
him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast
leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not
so much thy skill, then, O hunter , as the great necessities that strike the victory
to thee! In man, breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving for two or
three pulsa tions; so that whatever other  business he has to attend to, waking or
sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the Sperm Whale only breathes
about one seventh or Sunday of his time.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 230/353It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if it could
truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water , then I opine we should
be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him; for
the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout-
hole; and being so clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have
the power of smelli ng. But owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be
water or whether it be vapor—no absol ute certainty can as yet be arrived at on
this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper
olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no violets, no Cologne -
water in the sea. Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal,
and as that long canal—like the grand Erie Canal—is furnished with a sort of
locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of air or the upward
exclusion of water , therefore the whale has no voice; unless you insult him by
saying, that when he so strangely rumb les, he talks through his nose. But then
again, what has the whale to say? Seldo m have I known any profound being that
had anything to say to this world, unless forced to stammer out something by
way of getting a living. Oh!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"happy that the world is such an excellent listener! Now , the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for the
conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally , just beneath the
upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this curious canal is very much
like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street. But the question
returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water -pipe; in other words, whether the
spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whethe r
that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and dischar ged
through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with
the spouti ng canal; but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of
dischar ging water through the spiracle . Because the greatest necessity for so
doing would seem to be, when in feedin g he accidentally takes in water . But the
Sperm Whale’ s food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if
he would. Besides, if you regard him very closely , and time him with your
watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme
between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration. But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Speak out! You
have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell water from
air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"I have
ever found  your plain things the knotties t of all. And as for this whale spout, you
might almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely . The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it; and
how can you certain ly tell whether any water falls from it, when, always, when
you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout, he is in a
prodigious commoti on, the water cascad ing all around him. And if at such times
you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how
do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you
know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-
hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale’ s head? For even
when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with his elevated
hump sun-dried as a dromedary’ s in the desert; even then, the whale always
carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will
sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain. Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise
nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering into it, and putting

shreds of the jet, which will often happe n, your skin will feverishly smart, from
the acridness of the thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still
closer contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view , or
otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm. Wherefore,
among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it. Another
thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet is fairly
spouted into your eyes, it will blind you. The wisest thing the investigator can do
then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly spout alone. Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My
hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides other reasons ,
to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations touching the great inheren t
dignity and sublimit y of the Sperm Whale; I account him no common, shallow
being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings,
or near shores; all other whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and
profound. And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound
beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter , Dante, and so on, there alway s
goes up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep thoughts . While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror
before me; and ere long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and
undulation in the atmosphere over my head. The invariable moisture of my hair,
while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic,
of an August noon; this seems an additional ar gument for the above supposition. And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty , misty monster , to behold
him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild head overhung
by a cano py of vapor , engendered by his incommunicable contemplations, and
that vapor—as you will sometimes see it—glorified by a rainbow , as if Heaven
itself had put its seal upon his thoughts. For, d’ye see, rainbows do not visit the
clear air; they only irradiate vapor . And so, through all the thick mists of the dim
doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog
with a heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny ;
but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of all things
earthly , and intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination makes neithe r
believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye. CHAPTER 86.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Tail. Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope, and the
lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial, I celebrate a tail. Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale’s tail to begin at that point of the
trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises upon its upper
surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. The compact round body of its
root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away
to less than an inch in thickness.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly
overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide
vacancy between. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely
defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost expansion in
the full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 232/353The entire  member seems a dense webb ed bed of welded sinews; but cut into
it, and you find that three distinct strata  compose it:—upper , middle, and lower . The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long and horizontal; those of the
middle one, very short, and running crosswise between the outside layers.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"This
triune structure, as much as anything else, imparts power to the tail. To the
student of old Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to
the thin course of tiles always alterna ting with the stone in those wonderful
relics of the antique, and which undou btedly contribute so much to the great
strength of the masonry . But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough, the whole
bulk of the leviathan  is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibres and
filaments, which passing on either side the loins and running down into the
flukes, insensibly blend with them, and largely contribute to their might; so that
in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seem s
concentrated to a point. Could annihilation occur to matter , this were the thing to
do it. Nor does this—its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion
of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through a Titanism of
power . On the contrary , those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony , but it often bestows it; and in
everything imposing ly beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take
away the tied tendons that all over seem  bursting from the marble in the carved
Hercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the linen
sheet from  the naked corpse of Goethe,  he was overwhelmed with the massive
chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch. When Angelo paint s
even God the Father in human form , mark what robustness is there. And
whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled ,
hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most successfully
embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing
of any power , but the mere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance,
which on all hands  it is conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his
teachings. Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether wielded in
sport, or in earnest, or in anger , whatever be the mood it be in, its flexions are
invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein no fairy’ s arm can transcend it. Five great  motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for progression;
Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping; Fourth, in lobtailing;
Fifth, in peaking flukes. First: Bein g horizon tal in its position, the Leviathan’ s tail acts in a different
manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never wriggles. In man or fish,
wriggling is a sign of inferiority . To the whale, his tail is the sole means of
propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled forwards beneath the body , and then rapidly
sprung backwards, it is this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to
the monster when furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by . Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only fights
another sperm whal e with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his conflicts with
man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In striking at a boat, he swiftly
curves away his flukes from it, and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it
be made in the unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is
then simply irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only
salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the opposing water ,
then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale-boat, and the elasticity of
its materials, a crack ed rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 233/353generally the most serious result. These submer ged side blows are so often
received in the fishery , that they are accounted mere child’ s play. Some one
strips of f a frock, and the hole is stopped. Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale the sense
of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only
equalled by the daintiness of the elephant’ s trunk. This delicacy is chiefly
evinced in the action  of sweeping, when  in maidenly gentleness the whale with a
certain soft slownes s moves his imme nse flukes from side to side upon the
surface of the sea; and if he feel but a sailor ’s whisker , woe to that sailor ,
whiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch! Had this tail
any prehensile power , I should straightw ay bethink me of Darmonodes’  elephan t
that so frequented the flower -market , and with low salutations presented
nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their zones. On more accounts than one,
a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I
have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved
round his trunk and extracted the dart. Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the
middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his
dignity , and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth. But still you
see his power in his play.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The broad palm s of his tail are flirted high into the air;
then smiting the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You
would almost think a great gun had been  dischar ged; and if you noticed the light
wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity , you would think that
that was the smoke from the touch-hole. Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie
considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely out of sight
beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps, his entire
flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air, and so
remain vibrating a moment, till they downwards shoot out of view . Excepting
the sublime breach —somewhere else to be described—t his peaking of the
whale’ s flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically
snatching at the highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan
thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in
gazing at such scene s, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the
devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels. Standing at the mast-
head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large
herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun, and for a moment
vibrating in concert with peaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a
grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the
home of the fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African
elephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all
beings. For according to King Juba, the military elephants of antiquity often
hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence. The chanc e compar ison in this chapter , between the whale and the elephant,
so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are
concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality ,
much less the creatures to which they respectively belong. For as the mighties t
elephant is but a terrier to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan’ s tail, his
trunk is but the stalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant’ s trunk
were as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and crash
of the sperm whale’ s ponderous flukes, which in repeated instances have one6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

much as an Indian juggler tosses his balls.*
*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the
elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in
much the same respe ct to the whale that a dog does to the elephant; nevertheless ,
there are not wanting some points of curious similitude; among these is the
spout. It is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his
trunk, and then elevating it, jet it forth in a stream. The more I conside r this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my inability to
express it. At times there are gestures in it, which, though they would well grace
the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable. In an extensive herd, so
remarkable, occasionally , are these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters
who have declared them akin to Free-M ason signs and symbols; that the whale,
indeed, by these methods intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there
wanting other motions of the whale in his general body , full of strangeness, and
unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I may, then, I
but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I know not even the tail
of this whale, how understand his head? much more, how comprehend his face,
when face he has none? Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say,
but my face shall not be seen. But I cannot completely make out his back parts;
and hint what he will about his face, I say again he has no face. CHAPTER 87.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Grand
Armada. The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from
the territo ries of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia. In a
continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra, Java,
Bally , and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast mole, or rampart,
lengthwise connecti ng Asia with Australia, and dividing the long unbroken
Indian ocean from the thickly studded  oriental archipelagoes. This rampart is
pierced by several sally-ports for the convenience of ships and whales ;
conspicuous among which are the straits  of Sunda and Malacca. By the straits of
Sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China  from the west, emer ge into the China
seas. Those narrow straits of Sunda divide  Sumatra from Java; and standing
midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green
promontory , known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond to the
central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and considering the
inexhaustible wealth  of spices, and silks, and jewels, and gold, and ivory , with
which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched, it seems a
significant provision of nature, that such treasures, by the very formation of the
land, should at least bear the appearance , however ineffectual, of being guarded
from the all-graspin g western world. The shores of the Straits of Sunda are
unsupplied with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the
Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the Prop ontis. Unlike the Danes, these Orientals
do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endles s
procession of ships before the wind, which for centuries past, by night and by6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 235/353day, have passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java, freighted with the
costliest cargoes of the east. But while they freely waive a ceremonial like this,
they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute. Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the low
shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the vessels sailing
through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears . Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of
European cruisers, the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat
repressed; yet, even at the present day, we occasionally hear of English and
American vessels, which, in those wate rs, have been remorselessly boarded and
pillaged. With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits;
Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and thence, cruising
northwards, over waters known to be frequented here and there by the Sperm
Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands, and gain the far coast of Japan,
in time for the great whaling season there. By these means, the circumnavigating
Pequod would swee p almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the
world, previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though
everywhere else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby
Dick, in the sea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he might
most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it. But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his crew
drink air? Surely , he will stop for water . Nay. For a long time, now, the circus-
running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs no sustenance but what’ s
in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the whaler . While other hulls are loaded
down with alien stuff, to be transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering
whale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew , their weapons and their wants. She has a whole lake’ s contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with
utilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She carries years’
water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat,
the Nantu cketer , in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish fluid, but
yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is,
that, while  other ships may have gone to China from New York, and back again ,
touching at a score of ports, the whale -ship, in all that interval, may not have
sighted one grain of soil; her crew havin g seen no man but floating seamen like
themselves. So that did you carry them the news that another flood had come ;
they would only answer—“W ell, boys, here’ s the ark!”
Now , as many Sperm  Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java,
in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of the ground,
roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for
cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and more upon Java Head, the
look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and admonished to keep wide awake. But
though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and
with delig hted nostr ils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single
jet was descried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game
hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the customary
cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle of singular
magnificence saluted us. But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with which of
late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm Whales, instead of
almost invariably sailing in small detac hed companies, as in former times, are
now frequently met with in extensive herds, sometimes embracing so great a
multitude, that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 236/353solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection. To this
aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be imputed
the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you may now sometime s
sail for weeks and months together , without being greeted by a single spout; and
then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands. Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and forming a
great semi circle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a continuous chain of
whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the noon-day air. Unlike the straight
perpendicular twin-j ets of the Right Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in
two branc hes, like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow , the single forward-
slanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist,
continually rising and falling away to leeward. Seen from the Pequod’ s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of the sea,
this host of vapory  spouts, individually curling up into the air, and beheld
through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed like the thousand
cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried of a balmy autumnal
morning, by some horseman on a height. As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,
accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear,
and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain; even so did this
vast fleet of whales now seem hurryin g forward through the straits; gradually
contracting the wings of their semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but
still crescentic centre. Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers handling
their weap ons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that chased through these Straits of
Sunda, the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the
capture of not a few of their number . And who could tell whether , in that
congregated caravan , Moby Dick himse lf might not temporarily be swimming ,
like the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathan s
before us; when, of a sudden, the voice  of Tashtego was heard, loudly directing
attention to something in our wake. Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear. It
seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling something like the
spouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and go; for they
constantly hovered,  without finally disappearing. Levelling his glass at this
sight, Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole, crying, “Aloft there, and rig
whips and buckets to wet the sails;—Malays, sir , and after us!”
As if too long lurking behind the headla nds, till the Pequod should fairly have
entered the straits, these rascally Asiati cs were now in hot pursuit, to make up
for their over-cautious delay . But when the swift Pequod, with a fresh leading
wind, was herself in hot chase; how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to
assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit,—mere riding-whips and
rowels to her, that they were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced
the deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after
one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such fancy as the above seemed
his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the
ship was then sailin g, and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to
his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both
chasing and being chased to his deadly  end; and not only that, but a herd of
remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering
him on with their curses;—when all these conceits had passed through his brain,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 237/353Ahab’ s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after some
stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm thing from
its place. But thoug hts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and when,
after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the Pequod at last shot by
the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side, emer ging at last upon the
broad wate rs beyond ; then, the harpoone ers seemed more to grieve that the swift
whales had been gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so
victoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake of the
whales, at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the ship neared
them; and the wind now dying away , word was passed to spring to the boats. But
no sooner  did the herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm
Whale, become notified of the three keels that were after them,—though as yet a
mile in their rear,—than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and
battalions, so that their spouts all looked  like flashing lines of stacked bayonets,
moved on with redoubled velocity . Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and after
several hours’  pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase, when a
general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they
were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert
irresolution, which, when the fishermen  perceive it in the whale, they say he is
gallied. The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly
and steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and like
King Poru s’ elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander , they seemed going
mad with consternation. In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles, and
aimlessly swimming hither and thither , by their short thick spoutings, they
plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was still more strangely evinced
by those of their number , who, comp letely paralysed as it were, helplessly
floated like water -logged dismantled ships on the sea. Had these Leviathans
been but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce
wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay . But this
occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though
banding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have
fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how when
herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre’ s pit, they will, at the slightest
alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding, trampling, jamming ,
and remor selessly dashing each other to death. Best, therefore, withhold any
amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us, for there is no folly of the
beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men. Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion, yet it is
to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated, but
collectively remaine d in one place. As is customary in those cases, the boats at
once separated, each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the
shoal. In about three  minutes’  time, Queequeg’ s harpoon was flung; the stricken
fish darted  blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like light,
steered straight for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of
the whale struck under such circumsta nces, is in no wise unprecedented; and
indeed is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present one of the
more perilous vicis situdes of the fishe ry. For as the swift monster drags you
deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and
only exist in a delirious throb. As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of speed
to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we thus tore a white6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 238/353gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by the crazed creatures to and
fro rushing about us; our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a
tempest, and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits ,
knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed. But not a bit daunte d, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off from
this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away from that,
whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the time, Starbuck
stood up in the bows , lance in hand, pricking out of our way whatever whales he
could reach by short darts, for there was no time to make long ones. Nor were
the oarsme n quite idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed
with. They  chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business. “Out of the way,
Commodore!” cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the
surface, and for an instant threatened to swamp us. “Hard down with your tail,
there!” cried a second to another , which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly
cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity . All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented by the
Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of equal size are
stoutly clenched together , so that they cross each other ’s grain at right angles; a
line of considerable  length is then attached to the middle of this block, and the
other end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more whale s
are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm whale s
are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you must kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be
afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is, that at times like these the drugg,
comes into requisitio n. Our boat was furnished with three of them. The first and
second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly running
off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg. They were
cramped like malefactors with the chain  and ball. But upon flinging the third, in
the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the
seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and carried it away , dropping the
oarsman in the boat’ s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the
sea came in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and
shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for the time. It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it not that
as we advanced into the herd, our whale’ s way greatly diminished; moreover ,
that as we went still further and further  from the circumference of commotion ,
the direful  disorders  seemed waning. So that when at last the jerking harpoon
drew out, and the towing whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force
of his parting mom entum, we glided between two whales into the innermos t
heart of the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene
valley lake. Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales ,
were heard but not felt. In this central  expanse the sea presented that smooth
satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by
the whale in his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm
which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion. And still in the distracted
distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw
successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round ,
like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to shoulder , that
a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so
have gone  round on their backs. Owing  to the density of the crowd of reposing

possible chance of escape was at present afforded us. We must watch for a6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 239/353breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had only admitted us
in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally
visited by small tame cows and calves;  the women and children of this routed
host. Now , inclu sive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer
circles, and inclusive of the spaces betw een the various pods in any one of those
circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by the whole multitude, must
have conta ined at least two or three square miles. At any rate—though indeed
such a test at such a time might be deceptive—spoutings might be discovered
from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I
mention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been
purposely locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd
had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping; or,
possibly , being so young, unsophisticated, and every way innocent and
inexperienced; howe ver it may have been, these smaller whales—now and then
visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake—evinced a wondrous
fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it was
impossible not to marvel at. Like household dogs they came snuffling round us,
right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till it almost seemed that some
spell had suddenly domesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads;
Starbuck scratched their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences,
for the time refrained from darting it. But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still
stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended in those
watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales, and those
that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers. The lake, as I
have hinted, was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human
infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if
leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal
nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;—
even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us,
as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight. Floating on their
sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little infants, that
from certa in queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might have measured some
fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth. He was a little frisky; though
as yet his body seemed scarce yet recov ered from that irksome position it had so
lately occu pied in the maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the
final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar’s bow. The delicate side-
fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the plaited crumpled
appearance of a baby’ s ears newly arrived from foreign parts. “Line! line!” cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; “him fast! him fast! —Who line him! Who struck?—T wo whale; one big, one little!”
“What ails ye, man?” cried Starbuck. “Look-e here,” said Queequeg, pointing down. As when the strick en whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of
fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and shows the
slackened curling line buoyantly rising  and spiralling towards the air; so now,
Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilica l cord of Madame Leviathan, by which
the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam. Not seldom in the rapid
vicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes
entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the
subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We
saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 240/353*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike most
other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a gestation which may
probably be set down at nine months, producing but one at a time; though in
some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and Jacob:—a contingency
provided for in suckling by two teats, curiously situated, one on each side of the
anus; but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance
these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter ’s lance, the
mother ’s pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk
is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well with
strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute more
hominum . And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and
affrights, did these inscrutable creatur es at the centre freely and fearlessly
indulge in all peace ful concernments; yea, serenely revelled in dalliance and
delight. But even so, amid the tornadoe d Atlantic of my being, do I myself still
for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and while ponderous planets of
unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and deep inland there I still bathe
me in eternal mildness of joy . Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic spectacles
in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats, still engaged in drugging
the whales  on the frontier of the host; or possibly carrying on the war within the
first circle, where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were
afforded them. But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then
blindly darting to and fro across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our
eyes. It is sometim es the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly
powerful and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or
maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled cutting -
spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A whale wounded
(as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not effectually , as it seemed, had
broken away from the boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon line;
and in the extraordi nary agony of the wound, he was now dashing among the
revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of
Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went. But agoni zing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle
enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the
rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance
obscured from us. But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable
accidents of the fishery, this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line
that he towed; he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the
free end of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils
of the harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from
his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning through the water ,
violently flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him,
wounding and murdering his own comrades. This terrif ic object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary
fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little,
and tumble against each other , as if lifted by half spent billows from afar; then
the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chamber s
and nurseries vanished; in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the
more central circles  began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm
was departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the
tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in
Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre, as if to6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

changed places; Starbuck taking the stern.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"“Oars! Oars!” he intensely whispered, seizing the helm—“gripe your oars,
and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off, you
Queequeg—the whale there!—prick him!—hit him! Stand up—stand up, and
stay so! Spring, men—pull, men; never mind their backs—scrape them!—scrape
away!”
The boat was now all but jammed betw een two vast black bulks, leaving a
narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate endeavor we at
last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way rapidly , and at the same time
earnestly watching for another outlet. After many similar hair-breadth escapes,
we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles, but now
crossed by random whales, all violen tly making for one centre. This lucky
salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg’ s hat, who, while
standing in the bows to prick the fugiti ve whales, had his hat taken clean from
his head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad fluke s
close by . Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon resolved
itself into what seem ed a systematic movement; for having clumped together at
last in one dense body , they then renew ed their onward flight with augmented
fleetness. Further pursuit was useless; but the boats still lingered in their wake to
pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure
one which Flask had killed and waifed. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or
three of which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at
hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both to mark
its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession, should the boats of
any other ship draw near . The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying
in the Fishery ,—the more whales the less fish. Of all the drugged whales only
one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for the time, but only to be taken,
as will hereafter be seen, by some other craft than the Pequod. CHAPTER 88.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Schools and
Schoolmasters. The previ ous chapt er gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm
Whales, and there was also then given  the probable cause inducing those vast
aggregations. Now , though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must have
been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are occasionally
observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each. Such bands are
known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those composed almos t
entirely of females, and those musteri ng none but young vigorous males, or
bulls, as they are familiarly designated. In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a male
of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces his gallantry
by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies. In truth, this gentleman
is a luxuri ous Ottom an, swimming about over the watery world, surroundingly6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 242/353accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem. The contras t
between this Ottoma n and his concubine s is striking; because, while he is alway s
of the largest leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not
more than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are
comparatively delic ate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen yards
round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot  be denied, that upon the whole they are
hereditarily entitled to en bon point . It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings. Like fashi onables, they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety . You meet them on the Line in time for the full flower of the Equatorial feeding
season, having just returned, perhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern
seas, and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the
time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile, they
start for the Oriental waters in anticipati on of the cool season there, and so evade
the other excessive temperature of the year . When serenely adva ncing on one of these journeys, if any strange suspicious
sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family . Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming that way, presume to
draw confidentially close to one of the ladies, with what prodigious fury the
Bashaw assails him, and chases him away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled
young rakes like him are to be permitted  to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss;
though do what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out
of his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often cause
the most terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with the whales, who
sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They fence with their long
lower jaws, sometimes locking them together , and so striving for the supremacy
like elks that warrin gly interweave their antlers. Not a few are captured having
the deep scars of these encounters,—furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped
fins; and in some instances, wrenched and dislocated mouths. But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first
rush of the harem’ s lord, then is it very diverting to watch that lord. Gently he
insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile, still in
tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario, like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping
among his thousand concubines. Gran ting other whales to be in sight, the
fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand
Turks are too lavish  of their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small. As
for the sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must
take care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help. For like certain
other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my Lord Whale has no
taste for the nursery , however much for the bower; and so, being a great
traveller , he leaves his anonymous babies all over the world; every baby an
exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as the ardour of youth declines; as years and
dumps increase; as reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a general
lassitude overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the
love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant, admonitory
stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and grown to an exemplary , sulky
old soul, goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his
prayers, and warning each young Leviathan from his amorous errors. Now , as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is the lord
and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster . It is therefore
not in strict charact er, however admirably satirical, that after going to schoo l
himself, he should then go abroad incul cating not what he learned there, but the
folly of it. His title, schoolmaster , would very naturally seem derived from the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 243/353name bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised that the man who
first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must have read the memoirs of
Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a country-schoolmaster that famou s
Frenchman was in his younger days, and what was the nature of those occult
lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils. The same secludedn ess and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes
himself in his adva ncing years, is true of all aged Sperm Whales. Almost
universally , a lone whale—as a solitary Leviathan is called—proves an ancien t
one. Like venerable  moss-bearded Daniel Boone, he will have no one near him
but Nature herself; and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters, and the
best of wives she is, though she keeps so many moody secrets. The schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously
mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while those female
whales are characte ristically timid, the young males, or forty-barrel-bulls, as
they call them, are by far the most pugnacious of all Leviathans, and
proverbially the most dangerous to encounter; excepting those wondrous grey-
headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met, and these will fight you like grim
fiends exasperated by a penal gout. The Forty-barrel-bul l schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a mob of
young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness, tumbling round the
world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no prudent underwriter would
insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard. They soon
relinquish this turbulence though, and when about three-fourths grown, break
up, and separately go about in quest of settlements, that is, harems. Another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more
characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a Forty-barrel-bull—poor devil!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"all his
comrades quit him. But strike a member of the harem school, and her
companions swim around her with every token of concern, sometimes lingering
so near her and so long, as themselves to fall a prey . CHAPTER 89.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Fast-Fish and
Loose-Fish. The allusion to the waif and waif- poles in the last chapter but one,
necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery , of
which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge. It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company , a
whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed and
captured by another vessel; and herein  are indirectly comprised many mino r
contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For example,—after a
weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the body may get loose from
the ship by reason of a violent storm ; and drifting far away to leeward, be
retaken by a second whaler , who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside, without
risk of life or line. Thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often
arise betw een the fishermen, were there not some written or unwritten ,
universal, undisputed law applicable to all cases. Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment,
was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in A.D. 1695. But6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 244/353though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law, yet the American
fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter . They have
provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian’ s
Pandects and the By-laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of
Meddling with other People’ s Business. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a
Queen Anne’ s farthing, or the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so
small are they . I.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it. II. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it. But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity
of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it. First: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast, when it is
connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at all controllable by
the occupant or occupants,—a mast, an oar, a nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire,
or a strand of cobweb, it is all the same. Likewise a fish is technically fast when
it bears a waif, or any other recognised symbol of possession; so long as the
party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as
well as their intention so to do. These are scientific  commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen
themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the Coke-
upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and honorable
whalemen allowanc es are always made for peculiar cases, where it would be an
outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale
previously chased or killed by another  party . But others are by no means so
scrupulous. Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated in
England, wherein the plaintif fs set forth  that after a hard chase of a whale in the
Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintif fs) had succeeded in
harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of their lives, obliged to
forsake not only their lines, but their boat itself. Ultimately the defendants (the
crew of another ship) came up with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally
appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintif fs. And when those defendant s
were remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintif fs’ teeth,
and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done, he would
now retain  their line, harpoons, and boat, which had remained attached to the
whale at the time of the seizure. Whe refore the plaintif fs now sued for the
recovery of the value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat. Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the
judge. In the course  of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his
position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case, wherein a gentleman, after in
vain trying  to bridle his wife’ s viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the
seas of life; but in the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an
action to recover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then
supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the
lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of the great stress of her
plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned her; yet abandon her he did, so that
she became a loose-fish; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-
harpooned her, the lady then became  that subsequent gentleman’ s property ,
along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her . Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale and
the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other .6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 245/353These pleadings, and the counter pleadin gs, being duly heard, the very learned
judge in set terms decided, to wit,—That as for the boat, he awarded it to the
plaintif fs, because they had merely aban doned it to save their lives; but that with
regard to the controverted whale, harpoons, and line, they belonged to the
defendants; the whale, because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final
capture; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them, it
(the fish) acquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who
afterwards took the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took
the fish; er go, the aforesaid articles were theirs. A commo n man looking at this decisi on of the very learned Judge, might
possibly object to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter , the two
great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted, and
applied and elucidat ed by Lord Ellenbo rough in the above cited case; these two
laws touch ing Fast-F ish and Loose-Fish, I say, will, on reflection, be found the
fundamentals of all human jurisprudence; for notwithstanding its complicated
tracery of sculpture,  the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines,
has but two props to stand on. Is it not a saying in every one’s mouth, Possession is half of the law: that is,
regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often possession is the
whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of Russian serfs and Republican
slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession is the whole of the law? What to the
rapacious landlord is the widow’ s last mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder
undetected villain’ s marble mansion with a door-plate for a waif; what is that but
a Fast-Fish? What is the ruinous discoun t which Mordecai, the broker , gets from
poor Woebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone’ s family from
starvation; what is that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the Archbishop
of Savesoul’ s income of £100,000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of
hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure of heaven without any
of Savesou l’s help) what is that globular  £100,000 but a Fast-Fish? What are the
Duke of Dunder ’s hereditary towns and hamlets but Fast-Fish? What to that
redoubted harpoone er, John Bull, is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish? What to that
apostolic lancer , Brother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all
these, is not Possession the whole of the law? But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the kindred
doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is internationally and
universally applicable. What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the
Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress? What
was Poland to the Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What India to England? Wha t
at last will Mexico be to the United States? All Loose-Fish. What are the Rights  of Man and the Liberties of the World but Loose-Fish? What all men’ s minds and opinions but Loose-Fish? What is the principle of
religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish? What to the ostentatious smuggling
verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but Loose-Fish? What is the great globe
itself but a Loose-Fish? And what are you, reader , but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-
Fish, too? CHAPTER 90. Heads or  Tails.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

"3. Latin from the book s of the Laws of England, which taken along with the
context, means, that of all whales captur ed by anybody on the coast of that land,
the King, as Honorary Grand Harpoonee r, must have the head, and the Queen be
respectfully presented with the tail. A division which, in the whale, is much like
halving an apple; there is no intermediate remainder . Now as this law, under a
modified form, is to this day in force in England; and as it offers in variou s
respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is
here treated of in a separate chapter , on the same courteous principle that
prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate car, specially
reserved for the accommodation of royalty . In the first place, in curious proof of
the fact that the abov e-mentioned law is still in force, I proceed to lay before you
a circumstance that happened within the last two years. It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one of the
Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine
whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore. Now the
Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of
policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden. Holding the office directly from the
crown, I believe, all the royal emolumen ts incident to the Cinque Port territories
become by assignment his. By some writers this office is called a sinecure. But
not so. Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his
perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them. Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their trowsers
rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry,
promising themselv es a good £150 from the precious oil and bone; and in
fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives, and good ale with their cronies, upon
the strength of their respective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian
and charita ble gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and laying it
upon the whale’ s head, he says—“Hands off! this fish, my masters, is a Fast-
Fish. I seize it as the Lord Warden’ s.” Upon this the poor mariners in their
respectful consterna tion—so truly English—knowing not what to say, fall to
vigorously scratchin g their heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from
the whale to the stranger . But that did in nowise mend the matter , or at all soften
the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At length
one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made bold to speak,
“Please, sir , who is the Lord Warden?”
“The Duke.”
“But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?”
“It is his.”
“We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all that to
go to the Duke’ s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our pains but our blisters?”
“It is his.”
“Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a
livelihood?”
“It is his.”
“I thought  to relieve my old bed-ridden  mother by part of my share of this
whale.”
“It is his.”
“Won’t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?”
“It is his.”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

Wellington received  the money . Thinking that viewed in some particular lights,
the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed, under the
circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman of the town respectfully
addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to take the case of those unfortunate
mariners into full consideration.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"To which my Lord Duke in substance replied
(both letters were published) that he had already done so, and received the
money , and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he (the
reverend gentleman ) would decline meddling with other people’ s business. Is
this the still militant old man, standing at the corners of the three kingdoms, on
all hands coercing alms of beggars? It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to the
whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs inquire then on
what princ iple the Sovereign is originally invested with that right. The law itself
has alread y been set forth.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"But Plow don gives us the reason for it. Says
Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs to the King and Queen, “because of its
superior excellence. ” And by the soundest commentators this has ever been held
a cogent ar gument in such matters. But why should the King have the head , and the Queen the tail? A reason for
that, ye lawyers! In his treatise on “Queen-Gold,” or Queen-pinmoney , an old King’ s Bench
author , one William Prynne, thus discourseth: “Ye tail is ye Queen’ s, that ye
Queen’ s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.” Now this was written at
a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale was largely
used in ladies’  bodices. But this same bone is not in the tail; it is in the head,
which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the Queen a
mermaid, to be presented with a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk here. There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers—the whale and
the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and nominally
supplying the tenth branch of the crown’ s ordinary revenue. I know not that any
other author has hinted of the matter; but by inference it seems to me that the
sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale, the King receiving the
highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded,
may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality . And
thus there seems a reason in all things, even in law .","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"CHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets
The Rose-Bud. “In vain it was to rake for Amber griese in the paunch of this Leviathan,
insuf ferable fetor denying not inquiry .” Sir T . Browne, V .E. It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when we
were slowly sailing over a sleepy , vapo ry, mid-day sea, that the many noses on
the Pequod’ s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes
aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea. “I will bet somethin g now,” said Stubb, “that somewhere hereabouts are some
of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they would keel up
before long.”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 248/353Presently , the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance lay a
ship, whos e furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside. As
we glided nearer , the stranger showed French colours from his peak; and by the
eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled, and hovered, and swooped
around him, it was plain that the whale  alongside must be what the fishermen
call a blasted whale, that is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and so
floated an unappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory
odor such a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague, when
the living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable indeed is it
regarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it. Yet are there those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil
obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality , and by no means of the
nature of attar -of-rose. Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman had
a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of a
nosegay than the first. In truth, it turne d out to be one of those problematica l
whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia, or
indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything
like oil. Nevertheless, in the proper place we shall see that no knowing
fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he
may shun blasted whales in general. The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger , that Stubb vowed he
recognised his cutting spade-pole entang led in the lines that were knotted round
the tail of one of these whales. “There’ s a pretty fellow, now,” he bante ringly laughed, standing in the ship’ s
bows, “there’s a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes of Frenchmen are
but poor devils in the fishery; someti mes lowering their boats for breakers,
mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes, and sometimes sailing from their
port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles, and cases of snuffers,
foreseeing that all the oil they will get won’ t be enough to dip the Captain’ s wick
into; aye, we all know these things; but look ye, here’ s a Crappo that is content
with our leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too with
scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there. Poor devil! I say,
pass round a hat, some one, and let’s make him a present of a little oil for dear
charity’ s sake. For what oil he’ll get from that drugged whale there, wouldn’ t be
fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why,
I’ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of
ours, than he’ll get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of it, it
may conta in somet hing worth a good  deal more than oil; yes, amber gris. I
wonder now if our old man has though t of that.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"It’s worth trying. Yes, I’m for
it;” and so saying he started for the quarter -deck. By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether or no,
the Pequo d was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of escaping
except by its breezing up again. Issuin g from the cabin, Stubb now called his
boat’ s crew , and pulled off for the stranger . Drawing across her bow, he
perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste, the upper part of her
stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted
green, and for thorn s had copper spike s projecting from it here and there; the
whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour . Upon her
head boards, in large gilt letters, he read “Bouton de Rose,”—Rose-button, or
Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship. Though Stubb did not understand the Bouton  part of the inscript ion, yet the
word rose, and the bulbous figure-head put together , sufficiently explained the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 249/353whole to him. “A woode n rose-bu d, eh?” he cried with his hand to his nose, “that will do
very well; but how like all creation it smells!”
Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he had to
pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to the blasted
whale; and so talk over it. Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he bawled—“Bouton-
de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that speak English?”
“Yes,” rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be the
chief-mate. “Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?”
“What  whale?”
“The White  Whale—a Sperm Whale—Moby Dick, have ye seen him? “Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale—no.”
“Very good, then; good bye now , and I’ll call again in a minute.”
Then rapid ly pulling  back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning over
the quarter -deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands into a
trumpet and shouted—“No, Sir! No!”  Upon which Ahab retired, and Stubb
returned to the Frenchman. He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the chains,
and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of bag. “What’ s the matter with your nose, there?” said Stubb. “Broke it?”
“I wish it was broken, or that I didn’ t have any nose at all!” answered the
Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much. “But
what are you holding yours  for?”
“Oh, nothing! It’s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain’t it? Air
rather gardenny , I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will ye, Bouton-de -
Rose?”
“What in the devil ’s name do you want here?” roared the Guernseyman,
flying into a sudden passion. “Oh!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"keep cool—cool? yes, that’s the word! why don’t you pack those whales
in ice while you’re working at ’em? But joking aside, though; do you know ,
Rose-bud, that it’s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales? As for
that dried up one, there, he hasn’ t a gill in his whole carcase.”
“I know that well enough; but, d’ye see, the Captain here won’ t believe it; this
is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But come aboard, and
mayhap he’ll believe you, if he won’ t me; and so I’ll get out of this dirty
scrape.”
“Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow ,” rejoined Stubb, and
with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented itself. The
sailors, in tasselled caps of red worst ed, were getting the heavy tackles in
readiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and
seemed in anything but a good humor . All their noses upwardly projected from
their faces like so many jib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their
work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they
would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar , and at intervals held it to their
nostrils. Others having broken the stem s of their pipes almost short off at the
bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their
olfactories.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 250/353Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the
Captain’ s round-hou se abaft; and lookin g in that direction saw a fiery face thrust
from behind the door, which was held ajar from within. This was the tormented
surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had
betaken himself to the Captain’ s round-house (cabinet  he called it) to avoid the
pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times. Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the
Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate
expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who had
brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle. Sounding him
carefully , Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man had not the slightest
suspicion concernin g the amber gris. He therefore held his peace on that head,
but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly
concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without
his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity . According to this little plan of
theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter ’s office, was to tell the
Captain what he pleased, but as coming  from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to
utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview . By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a small
and dark, but rather  delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with large whiskers
and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch-seals at
his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely introduced by the Guernsey -
man, who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them. “What shall I say to him first?” said he. “Why ,” said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, “you may
as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me, though I don’t
pretend to be a judge.”
“He says, Monsieur ,” said the Guern sey-man, in French, turning to his
captain, “that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain and chief-
mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they
had brought alongside.”
Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more. “What now?” said the Guernsey-man to Stubb. “Why , since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him carefully ,
I’m quite certain that he’s no more fit to command a whale-ship than a St. Jago
monkey . In fact, tell him from me he’ s a baboon.”
“He vows and decla res, Monsieur , that the other whale, the dried one, is far
more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur , he conjures us, as we value
our lives, to cut loose from these fish.”
Instantly the captain  ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his crew to
desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast loose the cables and
chains confining the whales to the ship. “What now?” said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to them. “Why , let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that—that—in fact, tell
him I’ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody else.”
“He says, Monsieur , that he’ s very happy to have been of any service to us.”
Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties (meaning
himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his cabin to drink
a bottle of Bordeaux. “He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,” said the interpreter .6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 251/353“Thank him heartily; but tell him it’s against my principles to drink with the
man I’ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.”
“He says, Monsieur , that his principles won’ t admit of his drinking; but that if
Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur had best drop all
four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales, for it’s so calm they won’ t
drift.”
By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed the
Guernsey-man to this effect,—that having a long tow-line in his boat, he would
do what he could to help them, by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from
the ship’s side. While the Frenchman’ s boats, then, were engaged in towing the
ship one way, Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way,
ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line. Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;
hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the Pequod
slid in between him and Stubb’ s whale. Whereupon Stubb quickly pulled to the
floating body , and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his intentions, at once
proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-
spade, he commence d an excavation in the body , a little behind the side fin. You
would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at
length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman
tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat’ s crew were all in high
excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters. And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and screaming,
and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning to look
disappointed, especi ally as the horrible nosegay increased, when suddenly from
out the very heart of this plague, there stole a faint stream of perfume, which
flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river
will flow into and then along with another, without at all blending with it for a
time. “I have it, I have it,” cried Stubb, with delight, striking something in the
subterranean regions, “a purse! a purse!”
Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of
something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old cheese; very
unctuous and savory  withal. You might easily dent it with your thumb; it is of a
hue between yellow and ash colour . And this, good friends, is amber gris, worth a
gold guine a an ounce to any druggist. Some six handfuls were obtained; but
more was unavoidab ly lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been
secured were it not for impatient Ahab’ s loud command to Stubb to desist, and
come on board, else the ship would bid them good bye. CHAPTER 92.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Ambergris. Now this amber gris is a very curious substance, and so important as an article
of commerce, that in 1791 a certain  Nantucket-born Captain Coffin was
examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject. For at
that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day, the precise origin of
amber gris remained, like amber itself, a problem to the learned. Though the
word amber gris is but the French compound for grey amber , yet the two6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 252/353substances are quite distinct. For amber , though at times found on the sea-coast,
is also dug up in some far inland soils, whereas amber gris is never found excep t
upon the sea. Besid es, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance,
used for mouth-piec es to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but amber gris is soft,
waxy , and so highly fragrant and spicy , that it is largely used in perfumery , in
pastiles, precious candles, hair-powder s, and pomatum. The Turks use it in
cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is
carried to St. Peter ’s in Rome. Some wine merchants drop a few grains into
claret, to flavor it. Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale
themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale! Yet
so it is. By some, amber gris is supposed to be the cause, and by others the effect,
of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say,
unless by administe ring three or four boat loads of Brandreth’ s pills, and then
running out of harm’ s way , as laborers do in blasting rocks. I have forgotten to say that there were found in this amber gris, certain hard,
round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be sailors’  trowsers
buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of
small squid bones embalmed in that manner . Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant amber gris should be found in
the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that saying of St. Paul in
Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption; how that we are sown in
dishonor , but raised in glory . And likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus
about what it is that maketh the best musk. Also forget not the strange fact that
of all things of ill-sa vor, Cologne-water , in its rudimental manufacturing stages,
is the worst. I should like to conc lude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot, owing
to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen, and which, in the
estimation of some already biased minds, might be considered as indirectly
substantiated by what has been said of the Frenchman’ s two whales. Elsewhere
in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of
whaling is througho ut a slatternly , untid y business. But there is another thing to
rebut. They hint that all whales alway s smell bad. Now how did this odious
stigma originate? I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the Greenland whaling
ships in London, more than two centuri es ago. Because those whalemen did not
then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships have always
done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung
holes of large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the
season in those Icy Seas, and the sudde n and violent storms to which they are
exposed, forbidding any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking
into the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland
dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an
old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a L ying-in Hospital. I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise
imputed to the exist ence on the coast of Greenland, in former times, of a Dutch
village called Schme renbur gh or Smeerenber g, which latter name is the one used
by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great work on Smells, a text-book on that
subject. As its name imports (smeer , fat; berg, to put up), this village was
founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be
tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a
collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in full
operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor . But all this is quite6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 253/353different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years
perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume
fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that it is casked, the oil
is nearly scentless. The truth is, that living or dead, if but decently treated,
whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be
recognised, as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the
company , by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than
fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking abundance
of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the open air. I say,
that the motion of a Sperm Whale’ s flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as
when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor . What then shall I
liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance,  considering his magnitude? Must it not
be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with myrrh, which
was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander the Great? CHAPTER 93.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Castaway . It was but some few days after encou ntering the Frenchman, that a most
significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod’ s crew; an even t
most lame ntable; and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and
predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whateve r
shattered sequel might prove her own. Now , in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats. Some few
hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is to work the vessel
while the boats are pursuing the whale . As a general thing, these ship-keepers
are as hardy fellows as the men compris ing the boats’  crews. But if there happen
to be an unduly slender , clumsy , or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is

"Poor Pip! ye have heard of him
before; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so gloomy -
jolly. In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and a
white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour , driven in one
eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and torpid in
his intellects, Pip, though over tender -hearted, was at bottom very bright, with
that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever
enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any other race. For
blacks, the year’s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five

black was brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous

securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he had somehow
unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his brightness; though,
as ere long will be seen, what was thus temporarily subdued in him, in the end
was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously
showed him off to ten times the natural  lustre with which in his native Tolland
County in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler ’s frolic on the
green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the round
horizon into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in the clear air of day,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 254/353suspended against a blue-veined neck , the pure-watered diamond drop will
healthful glow; yet, when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in
its most impressive lustre, he lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it
up, not by the sun, but by some unnatural gases. Then come out those fiery
effulgences, inferna lly superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest
symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel stolen from the King of
Hell. But let us to the story . It came to pass, that in the amber gris affair Stubb’ s after-oarsman chanced so
to sprain his hand, as for a time to beco me quite maimed; and, temporarily , Pip
was put into his place. The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness; but
happily , for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and therefore came
off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing him, took care,
afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost, for he
might often find it needful. Now upon  the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as the
fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which happened, in this
instance, to be right under poor Pip’s seat. The involuntary consternation of the
moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the boat; and in such a way,
that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it
overboard with him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into
the water. That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly
straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat,
remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken several turns around
his chest and neck. Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He hated Pip
for a poltr oon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he suspended its sharp
edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb, exclaimed interrogatively , “Cut?”
Meantime Pip’s blue, choked face plainly looked, Do, for God’ s sake! All passed
in a flash. In less than half a minute, this entire thing happened. “Damn him, cut!” roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was saved. So soon as he recov ered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by yells
and execrations from the crew . Tranquil ly permitting these irregular cursings to
evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, busine ss-like, but still half humorous manner ,
cursed Pip officially; and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome
advice. The substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except—but all the rest
was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is. Now , in general, Stick to the boat,
is your true motto in whaling; but cases  will sometimes happen when Leap from
the boat, is still better . More over, as if perceivi ng at last that if he should give
undiluted conscient ious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a
margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice, and
concluded with a peremptory command, “Stick to the boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I
won’ t pick you up if you jump; mind that. We can’t afford to lose whales by the
likes of you; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in
Alabama. Bear that in mind, and don’t jump any more.” Hereby perhaps Stubb
indirectly hinted, that though man loved his fellow , yet man is a money-making
animal, which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence. But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was under
very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this time he did not
breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to run, Pip was left behind
on the sea, like a hurried traveller ’s trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his
word. It was a beau tiful, bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

hammered out to the extremest. Bobbin g up and down in that sea, Pip’s ebon
head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so
rapidly astern. Stubb ’s inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was
winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and
Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling, black
head to the sun, another lonely castaway , though the loftiest and the brightest. Now , in calm weath er, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised
swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful lonesomeness is
intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless
immensity , my God!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"who can tell it? Mark, how when sailors in a dead calm
bathe in the open sea—mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast
along her sides. But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No; he did
not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake, and he
supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very quickly , and
pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized
through their own timidity , is not always  manifested by the hunters in all similar
instances; and such instances not unfre quently occur; almost invariably in the
fishery , a coward, so called, is mark ed with the same ruthless detestation
peculiar to military navies and armies. But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly spying
whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and Stubb’ s boat was
now so far away , and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish, that Pip’s ringed
horizon began to expand around him miserably . By the merest chance the ship
itself at last rescued him; but from that hour the little negro went about the deck
an idiot; such, at least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite
body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely , though . Rather carried down alive to wondrou s depths, where strange shapes of the
unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes; and the miser -
merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless,
ever-juvenile eterni ties, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral
insects, that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs. He saw
God’ s foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it; and therefore his
shipmates called him mad. So man’ s insanity is heaven’ s sense; and wandering
from all mortal reason, man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to
reason, is absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised ,
indifferent as his God. For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly . The thing is common in that fishery;
and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what like abandonmen t
befell myself. CHAPTER 94.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

dragging away the larger tubs, so soon  as filled with the sperm; and when the
proper time arrived,  this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the
try-works, of which anon. It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with several others,
I sat down before a large Constantine’ s bath of it, I found it strangely concreted
into lumps, here and there rolling about in the liquid part.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"It was our business to
squeeze these lumps back into fluid.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"A sweet and unctuous duty! No wonder that
in old times this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such a
sweetener! such a softener! such a delic ious molifier!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"After having my hands in
it for only a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it were, to
serpentine and spiralise. As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter exertion at
the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under indolent sail, and gliding
so serenely along; as I bathed my hands among those soft, gentle globules of
infiltrated tissues, woven almost within  the hour; as they richly broke to my
fingers, and dischar ged all their opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I
snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma,—literally and truly, like the smell of
spring violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky meadow; I
forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible sperm, I washed my
hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit the old Paracelsan superstition
that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger; while bathing in that
bath, I felt divinely free from all ill-w ill, or petulance, or malice, of any sort
whatsoever . Squeeze!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm till I
myself almost melte d into it; I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity
came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers’  hand s
in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules. Such an abounding ,
affectionate, friendly , loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was
continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally;
as much as to say,—Oh! my dear fellow  beings, why should we longer cherish
any social  acerbitie s, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come; let us
squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us
squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness. Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since by
many prolonged, repeated experiences,  I have perceived that in all cases man
must even tually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of attainable felicity; not
placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but in the wife, the heart, the
bed, the table, the saddle, the fireside, the country; now that I have perceived all
this, I am ready to squeeze case eternall y. In thoughts of the visions of the night,
I saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti. Now , while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things akin to
it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try-works. First come s white-ho rse, so called, whic h is obtained from the tapering part of
the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It is tough with
congealed tendons—a wad of muscle—but still contains some oil. After being
severed from the whale, the white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere
going to the mincer . They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble. Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the
whale’ s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber , and often
participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is a most refreshing,
convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name imports, it is of an exceedingly6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 257/353rich, mottl ed tint, with a bestreaked snow y and golden ground, dotted with spots
of the deepest crimson and purple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron . Spite of reason, it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I
stole behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should conceive a
royal cutle t from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tasted, supposing him to
have been killed the first day after the venison season, and that particula r
venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of
Champagne. There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in the
course of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling adequately to
describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation original with the whalemen, and
even so is the nature  of the substance. It is an ineffably oozy , stringy affair, most
frequently found in the tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and
subsequent decanting. I hold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured membrane s
of the case, coalescing. Gurry , so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but
sometimes incidenta lly used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the dark,
glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland or right
whale, and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that
ignoble Leviathan. Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale’ s vocabulary . But as
applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman’ s nipper is a short firm strip of
tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan’ s tail: it averages an inch
in thickness, and for the rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise
moved along the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameles s
blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impurities.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once to
descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its inmates. This place
has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket-pieces, when
stript and hoisted from the whale. When  the proper time arrives for cutting up its
contents, this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night. On
one side, lit by a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"They
generally go in pairs,—a pike-and-gaf fman and a spade-man. The whaling-pike
is similar to a frigate’ s boarding-wea pon of the same name. The gaff is
something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of
blubber , and strives to hold it from slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches
about. Meanwhile, the spade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly
chopping it into the portable horse-pieces. This spade is sharp as hone can make
it; the spademan’ s feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will sometimes
irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge. If he cuts off one of his own toes,
or one of his assistants’, would you be very much astonished? Toes are scarce
among veteran blubber -room men. CHAPTER 95.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Cassock. Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this post-
mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass ,
pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very
strange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen there, lying along6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw; not the miracle of his
symmetrical tail; none of these would so surprise you, as half a glimpse of that
unaccountable cone, —longer than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at
the base, and jet-black as Yojo, the ebon y idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed ,
it is; or, rather, in old times, its likenes s was. Such an idol as that found in the
secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for worshipping which, King
Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the idol, and burnt it for an
abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the
First Book of Kings. Look at the sailor , called the mincer , who now comes along, and assisted by
two allies , heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners call it, and with
bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead
comrade from the field. Extending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds
cylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the pelt of a boa. This
done he turns the pelt inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching,
so as almost to double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in the
rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some three feet of it,
towards the pointed  extremity , and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the
other end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it. The mincer now stands
before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling. Immemorial to all his
order , this investiture alone will adequa tely protect him, while employed in the
peculiar functions of his of fice. That office consists  in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the pots; an
operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse, planted endwise
against the bulwarks, and with a capacio us tub beneath it, into which the minced
pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt orator ’s desk. Arrayed in decent black ;
occupying a conspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves; what a candidate for an
archbishopric, what a lad for a Pope were this mincer!*
*Bible leaves! Bible leaves!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"This is the invariable cry from the mates to the
mincer . It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as thin slices as
possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much
accelerated, and its quantity considerably increased, besides perhaps improving
it in quality . CHAPTER 96.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Try-W orks. Besides her hoisted boats, an American  whaler is outwardly distinguished by
her try-works. She presents the curiou s anomaly of the most solid masonry
joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship. It is as if from the
open field a brick-kiln were transported to her planks. The try-w orks are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most
roomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength, fitted to
sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar , some ten feet by
eight square, and five in height. The foundation does not penetrate the deck, but
the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing
it on all sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased with
wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened hatchway . Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in number , and each of6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 259/353several barrels’  capacity . When not in use, they are kept remarkably clean.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand, till they shine within like
silver punch-bowls. During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will
crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap. While employed in
polishing them—on e man in each pot, side by side—many confidentia l
communications are carried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound
mathematical medita tion. It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the
soapstone diligently  circling round me, that I was first indirectly struck by the
remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid, my
soapstone for example, will descend from any point in precisely the same time. Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare masonry of
that side is exposed,  penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces, directly
underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron. The
intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck, by
means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the
works. By a tunnel inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with
water as fast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct
from the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment. It was about nine o’clock at night that the Pequod’ s try-works were first
started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee the business.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"“All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the works.”
This was an easy thing, for the carpenter  had been thrusting his shavings into the
furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first
fire in the try-works  has to be fed for a time with wood. After that no wood is
used, except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after
being tried out, the crisp, shrivelled blubber , now called scraps or fritters, still
contains considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed the flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr , or a self-consuming misanthrope, once ignited,
the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body . Would that he
consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is horrible to inhale, and inhale it you
must, and not only that, but you must live in it for the time. It has an
unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of
funereal pyres. It smells like the left wing of the day of judgment; it is an
argument for the pit. By midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the carcase;
sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean darkness was
intense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames, which at intervals
forked forth from the sooty flues, and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging,
as with the famed Greek fire. The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly
commissioned to some vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur -freighted brigs
of the bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad
sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates, and folded them
in conflagrations. The hatch , removed  from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth in
front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan
harpooneers, always the whale-ship’ s stokers. With huge pronged poles they
pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or stirred up the fires
beneath, till the snaky flames darted, curling, out of the doors to catch them by
the feet. The smoke rolled away in sulle n heaps. To every pitch of the ship there
was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces . Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden hearth ,
was the windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the watch, when not
otherwise employed , looking into the red heat of the fire, till their eyes felt6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 260/353scorched in their heads. Their tawny features, now all begrimed with smoke and
sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth,
all these were stran gely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works . As they narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their tales of terror told
in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them, like
the flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their front, the harpooneers wildly
gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers; as the wind howled on,
and the sea leaped, and the ship groaned  and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her
red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and
scornfully champed  the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her
on all sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden with
fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness, seemed
the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander ’s soul. So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently guided
the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that interval, in darknes s
myself, I but the better saw the redness, the madness, the ghastliness of others . The continual sight of the fiend shapes  before me, capering half in smoke and
half in fire, these at last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as I began to
yield to that unaccountable drowsiness  which ever would come over me at a
midnight helm. But that night, in particular , a strange  (and ever since inexplicable) thing
occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was horribly conscious of
something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller smote my side, which leaned
against it; in my ears was the low hum of sails, just beginning to shake in the
wind; I thought my eyes were open; I was half conscious of putting my finger s
to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all
this, I could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed but a
minute since I had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle lamp
illuminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made
ghastly by flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression, that whatever
swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as
rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came
over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy conceit
that the tiller was, somehow , in some enchanted way, inverted. My God!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"what is
the matter with me? thought I.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself about ,
and was fronting the ship’ s stern, with my back to her prow and the compass. In
an instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the
wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad and how grateful the relief
from this unnatural hallucination of the night, and the fatal contingency of being
brought by the lee! Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Never dream with thy hand
on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first hint of the
hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its redness makes all things
look ghastly . To-morrow , in the natural sun, the skies will be bright; those who
glared like devils in the forking flames, the morn will show in far other , at least
gentler , relief; the glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true lamp—all others but
liars! Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia’s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome’ s
accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of deserts and
of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean, which is the dark side
of this earth, and which is two thirds of this earth. So, therefore, that mortal man
who hath more of joy than sorrow in him, that mortal man cannot be true—no t

hammered steel of woe. “All is vanity .” ALL.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"This wilful world hath not got
hold of unchristian Solomon’ s wisdom  yet. But he who dodges hospitals and
jails, and walks fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of operas than
hell; calls Cowper , Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of sick men; and
throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing wise, and therefore
jolly;—not that man is fitted to sit down on tomb-stones, and break the green
damp mould with unfathomably wondrous Solomon. But even Solomon,  he says, “the man that wandereth out of the way of
understanding shall remain” (i.e., even while living) “in the congregation of the
dead.” Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it invert thee, deaden thee; as for the
time it did me. Ther e is a wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there  is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the
blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny
spaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the
mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still highe r
than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar . CHAPTER 97.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Lamp. Had you descended from the Pequod’ s try-works to the Pequod’ s forecastle,
where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single moment you would have
almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings
and counsellors. There they lay in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a
chiselled muteness; a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes. In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens. To
dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in darkness to his pallet, this is
his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he seeks the food of light, so he lives in light. He makes his berth an Aladdin’ s lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the
pitchiest night the ship’ s black hull still houses an illumination. See with what entire  freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps—often
but old bottles and vials, though—to the copper cooler at the try-works, and
replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a vat. He burns, too, the purest of oil, in
its unman ufactured, and, therefore, unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar ,
lunar , or astral contrivances ashore. It is sweet as early grass butter in April. He
goes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness, even
as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own supper of game. CHAPTER 98.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Stowing Down and
Clearing Up. Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from
the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors, and slaughtered in the
valleys of the deep; how he is then towed alongside and beheaded; and how (on6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

beheaded was killed) his great padde d surtout becomes the property of his
executioner; how, in due time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through
the fire;—but now it remains to concl ude the last chapter of this part of the
description by rehearsing—singing, if I may—the romantic proceeding of
decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold, where
once again leviathan returns to his native profundities, sliding along beneath the
surface as before; but, alas! never more to rise and blow .","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the six-barrel casks;
and while , perhaps,  the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the
midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over, end for
end, and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck, like so many land
slides, till at last man-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the
hoops, rap, rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, ex officio,
every sailor is a cooper . At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the great
hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open, and down go
the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the hatches are replaced, and
hermetically closed, like a closet walled up. In the sperm fishery , this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in
all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream with freshets of blood
and oil; on the sacred quarter -deck enormous masses of the whale’ s head are
profanely piled; great rusty casks lie about, as in a brewery yard; the smoke from
the try-works has besooted all the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with
unctuousness; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself; while on all hand s
the din is deafening. But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this self-
same ship; and were  it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works, you would all but
swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a most scrupulously neat
commander . The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing
virtue. This is the reason why the deck s never look so white as just after what
they call an affair of oil. Besides, from  the ashes of the burned scraps of the
whale, a potent lye is readily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the
back of the whale remains clinging to the side, that lye quickly exterminates it. Hands go diligently along the bulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags
restore them to their full tidiness. The soot is brushed from the lower rigging. All
the nume rous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully
cleansed and put away . The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-
works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles are
coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of
almost the entire ship’ s company , the whole of this conscientious duty is at last
concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions; shift
themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the immaculate deck, fresh and
all aglow , as bridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest Holland. Now , with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and
humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics; propose to
mat the deck; think of having hanging  to the top; object not to taking tea by
moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to such musked mariners of
oil, and bone, and blubber , were little short of audacity . They know not the thing
you distantly allude to.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

"The Doubloon. Ere now it has been related how Ahab  was wont to pace his quarter -deck,
taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in the
multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that
sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood, he was wont to
pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely eyeing the particular objec t
before him. When he halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on the
pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed
intensity of his purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the
mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin
there, he still wore  the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a
certain wild longing, if not hopefulness. But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as though now for
the first time begin ning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way
whatever significance might lurk in them . And some certain significance lurks in
all things, else all things are little worth, and the round world itself but an empty
cipher , except to sell by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up
some morass in the Milky Way. Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the
heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the head-
waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst all the rustiness
of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet, untouchable and immaculate
to any foulness, it still preserved its Quito glow . Nor, though placed amongst a
ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong
nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 264/353nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it
was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in
their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale’ s
talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night, wondering
whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to spend it. Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and
tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun’s disks and stars;
ecliptics, horns-of-plenty , and rich banners waving, are in luxuriant profusion
stamped; so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness
and enhancing glories, by passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly
poetic. It so chanc ed that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example of
these things. On its round border it bore the letters, REPUBLICA  DEL
ECUADOR: QUIT O. So this bright coin came from a country planted in the
middle of the world, and beneath the great equator , and named after it; and it had
been cast midway up the Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn . Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes’  summits; from one a
flame; a tower on another; on the third  a crowing cock; while arching over all
was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual
cabalistics, and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra. Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now
pausing. “There’ s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and all other
grand and lofty things; look here,—three peaks as proud as Lucifer . The firm
tower , that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the courageous, the undaunted ,
and victor ious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all are Ahab; and this round gold is but
the image of the rounder globe, which, like a magician’ s glass, to each and every
man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains
for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Methinks now
this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign of storms, the
equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries ! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in throes, ’tis fit that man should live
in pains and die in pangs! So be it, then!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Here’ s stout stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.”
“No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil’ s claws must have left
their mouldings there since yesterday ,” murmured Starbuck to himself, leaning
against the bulwarks . “The old man seems to read Belshazzar ’s awful writing. I
have never marked the coin inspectingly . He goes below; let me read. A dark
valley betw een three mighty , heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity ,
in some faint earthly  symbol. So in this vale of Death, God girds us round; and
over all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope. If
we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil; but if we lift them,
the bright sun meets our glance half way, to cheer . Yet, oh, the great sun is no
fixture; and if, at midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him,
we gaze for him in vain! This coin speaks wisely , mildly , truly, but still sadly to
me. I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely .”
“There now’s the old Mogul,” soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, “he’s been
twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with faces which I
should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long. And all from looking
at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer ’s Hook ,
I’d not look at it very long ere spending it.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

wanting; and while we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as
Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when

Enderby, of London. “Ship, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?”
So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours, bearing
down unde r the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was standing in his hoisted
quarter -boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain, who was
carelessly reclining in his own boat’ s bow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly , good-
natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spaciou s
roundabout, that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty
arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar ’s
surcoat. “Hast seen the White Whale?”
“See you this?” and withdrawing it from  the folds that had hidden it, he held
up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden head like a mallet. “Man my boat!” cried Ahab, impetuously , and tossing about the oars near him
—“Stand by to lower!”
In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his crew were
dropped to the water , and were soon alongside of the stranger . But here a curiou s
difficulty presented itself. In the excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten
that since the loss of his leg he had neve r once stepped on board of any vessel at
sea but his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy
mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and
shipped in any other vessel at a moment’ s warning. Now , it is no very easy
matter for anybody—except those who are almost hourly used to it, like
whalemen—to clam ber up a ship’ s side from a boat on the open sea; for the
great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and then
instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So, deprived of one leg, and
the strange  ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention ,
Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again ;
hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain. It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward circumstance that
befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap, almos t
invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And in the present instance, all this was
heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the
side, by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging toward s
him a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem to
bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their
sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute, because the strange
captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood, cried out, “I see, I see!—avast
heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle.”
As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two
previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved blubber -
hook, now clean and dry, was still attach ed to the end. This was quickly lowered
to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve
of the hook (it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor , or the crotch of an apple
tree), and then giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time also
helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over -hand upon one of the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 268/353running parts of the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high
bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly
thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his
ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in
his walrus  way, “Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!—an arm and a
leg!—an arm that never can shrink, d’ye see; and a leg that never can run. Where did’ st thou see the White Whale?—how long ago?”
“The White Whale,” said the Englishma n, pointing his ivory arm towards the
East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a telescope; “there I saw
him, on the Line, last season.”
“And he took that arm off, did he?” asked Ahab, now sliding down from the
capstan, and resting on the Englishman’ s shoulder , as he did so. “Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?”
“Spin me the yarn,” said Ahab; “how was it?”
“It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,” began the
Englishman. “I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time. Well, one day we
lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat fastened to one of them; a
regular circus horse he was, too, that went milling and milling round so, that my
boat’ s crew  could only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale . Presently up breache s from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a
milky-white head and hump, all crows’  feet and wrinkles.”
“It was he, it was he!” cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended breath. “And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.”
“Aye, aye—they were mine— my irons,” cried Ahab, exultingly—“but on!”
“Give me a chance, then,” said the Englishman, good-humoredly . “Well, this
old great- grandfather , with the white head and hump, runs all afoam into the
pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line! “Aye, I see!—wanted to part it; free the fast-fish—an old trick—I know him.”
“How it was exactly ,” continued the one-armed commander , “I do not know;
but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there somehow; but we
didn’ t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line, bounce we
came plump on to his hump! instead of the other whale’ s; that went off to
windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters stood, and what a noble great whale
it was—the noblest and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life—I resolved to capture
him, spite of the boiling rage he seeme d to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard
line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil
of a boat’ s crew for a pull on a whale-l ine); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into
my first mate’ s boat—Mr . Mounttop’ s here (by the way, Captain—Mounttop ;
Mounttop—the captain);—as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop’ s boat,
which, d’ye see, was gunwale and gunw ale with mine, then; and snatching the
first harpo on, let this old great-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir—
hearts and souls alive, man—the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat—both
eyes out— all befogged and bedeadened with black foam—the whale’ s tail
looming straight up out of it, perpendic ular in the air, like a marble steeple. No
use sternin g all, then; but as I was groping at midday , with a blinding sun, all
crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second iron, to toss it overboard
—down comes the tail like a Lima tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each
half in splinters; and, flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as
though it was all chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized
hold of my harpoon -pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that like a
sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same instant, the fish,
taking one good dart forwards, went down like a flash; and the barb of that6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 269/353cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here” (clapping his hand
just below  his shoulder); “yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to
Hell’ s flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God,
the barb ript its way along the flesh—clear along the whole length of my arm—
came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;—and that gentleman there will tell
you the rest (by the way, captain—Dr . Bunger , ship’ s surgeon: Bunger , my lad,
—the captain). Now , Bunger boy , spin your part of the yarn.”
The professional gentleman thus familia rly pointed out, had been all the time
standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his gentlemanly rank
on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober one; he was dressed in a
faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched trowsers; and had thus far been
dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box
held in the other , occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the
two crippl ed captai ns. But, at his superior ’s introduction of him to Ahab, he
politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain’ s bidding. “It was a shocking bad wound,” began  the whale-sur geon; “and, taking my
advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy—”
“Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship,” interrupted the one-armed captain,
addressing Ahab; “go on, boy .”
“Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing hot
weather there on the Line. But it was no use—I did all I could; sat up with him
nights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet—”
“Oh, very severe!” chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly altering his
voice, “Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till he couldn’ t see to put
on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half seas over, about three o’clock in
the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up with me indeed, and was very severe in my
diet. Oh! a great watcher , and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger . (Bunger ,
you dog, laugh out! why don’t ye? You know you’re a precious jolly rascal. )
But, heave ahead, boy, I’d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other
man.”
“My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir”—said the
imperturbable godly-looking Bunger , slightly bowing to Ahab—“is apt to be
facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort. But I may as well
say—en passant, as the French remar k—that I myself—that is to say, Jack
Bunger , late of the reverend clergy—am a strict total abstinence man; I never
drink—”
“Water!” cried the captain; “he never drinks it; it’s a sort of fits to him; fresh
water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on—go on with the arm story .”
“Yes, I may as well,” said the surgeon , coolly . “I was about observing, sir,
before Captain Boomer ’s facetious interruption, that spite of my best and
severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse; the truth was, sir, it
was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw; more than two feet and several
inches long. I measured it with the lead line.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"In short, it grew black; I knew what
was threatened, and off it came. But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm
there; that thing is against all rule”—pointing at it with the marlingspike—“tha t
is the captain’ s work , not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had that
club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one’s brains out with, I
suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical passions sometimes. Do
ye see this dent, sir”—removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and
exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull , but which bore not the slightest scarry
trace, or any token of ever having been a wound—“W ell, the captain there will
tell you how that came here; he knows.”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 270/353“No, I don’t,” said the captain, “but his mother did; he was born with it. Oh,
you solemn rogue, you—you Bunger! was there ever such another Bunger in the
watery world? Bunger , when you die, you ought to die in pickle, you dog; you
should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.”
“What became of the White Whale?” now cried Ahab, who thus far had been
impatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen. “Oh!” cried the one-armed captain, “oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we
didn’ t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I didn’ t then know
what whale it was that had served me such a trick, till some time afterwards,
when coming back to the Line, we heard about Moby Dick—as some call him—
and then I knew it was he.”
“Did’ st thou cross his wake again?”
“Twice.”
“But could not fasten?”
“Didn’ t want to try to: ain’t one limb enough? What should I do without this
other arm? And I’m thinking Moby Dick doesn’ t bite so much as he swallows.”
“Well, then,” interrupted Bunger , “give him your left arm for bait to get the
right. Do you know , gentlemen”—very gravely and mathematically bowing to
each Captain in succession—“Do you know , gentlemen, that the digestive
organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine Providence, that it
is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a man’ s arm? And he
knows it too. So that what you take for the White Whale’ s malice is only his
awkwardness. For he never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to
terrify by feints. But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow , formerly a
patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a
time let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth
or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d’ye
see. No possible way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it
into his general bodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer , if you are quick enough
about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving
decent burial to the other , why in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale

“No, thank  ye, Bunger ,” said the Englis h Captain, “he’s welcome to the arm
he has, since I can’t help it, and didn’ t know him then; but not to another one. No more White Whales for me; I’ve lowered for him once, and that has satisfied
me. There would be great glory in killing him, I know that; and there is a ship-
load of precious sperm in him, but, hark ye, he’s best let alone; don’t you think
so, Captain?”—glancing at the ivory leg. “He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let alone, that
accursed thing is not always what least allures. He’s all a magnet! How long
since thou saw’ st him last? Which way heading?”
“Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend’ s,” cried Bunger , stoopingly walking
round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; “this man’ s blood—bring the
thermometer!—it’ s at the boiling point!—his pulse makes these planks beat!—
sir!”—taking a lancet from his pocket, and drawing near to Ahab’ s arm. “Avast!” roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks—“Man the boat! Which way heading?”
“Good God!” cried the English Capta in, to whom the question was put. “What’ s the matter? He was heading east, I think.—Is your Captain crazy?”

boat’ s steering oar, and Ahab, swin ging the cutting-tackle towards him,
commanded the ship’ s sailors to stand by to lower . In a mom ent he was standing in the boat’ s stern, and the Manilla men were
springing to their oars. In vain the Engl ish Captain hailed him. With back to the
stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own, Ahab stood upright till

"The Decanter . Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she hailed from
London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby , merchant of that city, the
original of the famous whaling house of Enderby & Sons; a house which in my
poor whal eman’ s opinion, comes not far behind the united royal houses of the
Tudors and Bourbons, in point of real historical interest. How long, prior to the
year of our Lord 1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerou s
fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out the first
English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale; though for some
score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant Coffins and Maceys of
Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued that Leviathan, but only
in the North and South Atlantic: not elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here,
that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized
steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they were the only
people of the whole globe who so harpooned him. In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose, and at the
sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape Horn, and was the
first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one; and returning to her berth with her hold
full of the precious sperm, the Amelia’ s example was soon followed by other
ships, English and American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the
Pacific were thrown  open. But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable
house again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons—how many , their mother
only knows—and under their immedia te auspices, and partly , I think, at their
expense, the British government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on
a whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea. Commanded by a naval Post-
Captain, the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and did some service; how
much does not appear . But this is not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a
discovery whale ship of their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters
of Japan. That ship—well called the “Syren”—made a noble experimenta l
cruise; and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became
generally known. The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a
Captain Cof fin, a Nantucketer . All honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to the
present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have slipped
his cable for the great South Sea of the other world. The ship named after him was worthy of the honor , being a very fast sailer
and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the
Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the forecastle. It was a fine gam
we had, and they were all trumps—every soul on board. A short life to them, and6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 272/353a jolly death. And that fine gam I had—long, very long after old Ahab touched
her planks with his ivory heel—it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon
hospitality of that ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember
me, if I ever lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it at
the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it’s squally off
there by Patagonia),  and all hands—visitors and all—were called to reef topsails ,
we were so top-heav y that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines; and we
ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails, so that we hung there ,
reefed fast in the howling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However ,
the masts did not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober ,
that we had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down the
forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste. The beef was fine—tough, but with body in it. They said it was bull-beef;
others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know , for certain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial, symmetrically globular , and
indestructible dumpl ings. I fancied that you could feel them, and roll them about
in you after they were swallowed. If you stooped over too far forward, you
risked their pitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread—but that couldn’ t
be helped ; besides, it was an anti-scor butic; in short, the bread contained the
only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very light, and it was very
easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it. But all in all, taking her
from truck  to helm, considering the dimensions of the cook’ s boilers, including
his own live parchm ent boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a
jolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows all, and
capital from boot heels to hat-band. But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby , and some other English
whalers I know of—not all though—were such famous, hospitable ships; that
passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the joke; and were not
soon weary of eating , and drinking, and laughing? I will tell you. The abounding
good cheer of these English whalers is matter for historical research. Nor have I
been at all sparing of historical whale research, when it has seemed needed. The Engl ish were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,
Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant in the
fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching plenty to eat and
drink. For, as a general thing, the Engli sh merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but
not so the English whaler . Hence, in the English, this thing of whaling good
cheer is not normal  and natural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore ,
must have some special origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still furthe r
elucidated. During my researche s in the Leviathanic  histories, I stumbled upon an ancient
Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew must be abou t
whalers. The title was, “Dan Coopman,” wherefore I concluded that this must be
the invaluable memoirs of some Ams terdam cooper in the fishery , as every
whale ship must carry its cooper . I was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that
it was the production of one “Fitz Swackhammer .” But my friend Dr. Snodhead,
a very learned man, professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of
Santa Clau s and St. Pott’ s, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving
him a box of sperm candles for his trouble—this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as
he spied the book, assured me that “Dan Coopman” did not mean “The Cooper ,”
but “The Merchant.” In short, this ancie nt and learned Low Dutch book treated
of the commerce of Holland; and, among other subjects, contained a very
interesting account of its whale fishery . And in this chapter it was, headed,
“Smeer ,” or “Fat,” that I found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 273/353and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalem en; from which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:
400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesl and pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins of butter . 20,000
lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese (probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of beer . Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in the present
case, howe ver, wher e the reader is flooded with whole pipes, barrels, quarts, and
gills of good gin and good cheer . At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer,
beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were incidentally
suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic application; and,
furthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my own, touching the probable
quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that
ancient Greenland and Spitzber gen whale fishery . In the first place, the amount
of butter, and Texel and Leyden cheese  consumed, seems amazing. I impute it,
though, to their naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous
by the nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game in
those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the
convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil. The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now , as those polar
fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate, so that
the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen, including the short voyage to
and from the Spitzber gen sea, did not much exceed three months, say, and
reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch
seamen in all; therefore, I say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for
a twelve weeks’  allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of
gin. Now , whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might
fancy them  to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat’ s head ,
and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem somewhat improbable. Yet
they did aim at them, and hit them too. But this was very far North, be it
remembered, where beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the Equator , in
our southern fishery , beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the
mast-head and boozy in his boat; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucke t
and New Bedford. But no more; enoug h has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of two
or three centuries ago were high livers ; and that the English whalers have not
neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when cruising in an empty
ship, if you can get nothing better out of the world, get a good dinner out of it, at
least. And this empties the decanter .","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"CHAPTER 102. A Bower  in the
Arsacides. Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly dwelt
upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail upon some few
interior structural features. But to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension
of him, it behooves me now to unbutt on him still further , and untagging the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 274/353points of his hose, unbuckling his garters, and casting loose the hooks and the
eyes of the joints of his innermost bone s, set him before you in his ultimatum ;
that is to say , in his unconditional skeleton. But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the fishery ,
pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale? Did erudite
Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures on the anatomy of the
Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a specimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for
examination, as a cook dishes a roast-p ig? Surely not. A veritable witness have
you hither to been, Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah
alone; the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams; the rafters, ridge-
pole, sleep ers, and under -pinnings, making up the frame-work of leviathan; and
belike of the tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, and cheeseries in his bowels. I confess, that since  Jonah, few whalem en have penetrated very far beneath
the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed with an
opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged to, a small cub
Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag, to make
sheaths for the barbs  of the harpoons, and for the heads of the lances. Think you
I let that chance go, without using my boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking
the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub? And as for my exact  knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic,
full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted to my late royal
friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides. For being at Tranque ,
years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey of Algiers, I was invited to
spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque, at his retired
palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not very far distant from what our sailor s
called Bamboo-T own, his capital. Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted with
a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought together in Pupella
whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent; chiefly
carved woods of wonderful devices, chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly
paddles, aromatic canoes; and all these distributed among whatever natural
wonders, the wonder -freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his
shores. Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an unusually
long ragin g gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his head against a
cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet. When the vast body  had at last been stripped of its fathom-deep enfoldings, and
the bones become dust dry in the sun, then the skeleton was carefully
transported up the Pupella glen, where a grand temple of lordly palms now
sheltered it. The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebræ were carved with Arsacidean
annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests kept up an
unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again sent forth its
vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the terrific lower jaw vibrated
over all the devotees, like the hair -hung sword that so af frighted Damocles. It was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen; the
trees stood high and haughty , feeling their living sap; the industrious earth
beneath was as a weaver ’s loom, with a gorgeous carpet on it, whereof the
ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and woof, and the living flowers the
figures. All the trees, with all their laden  branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and
grasses; the message-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active. Through the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 275/353lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the
unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!—pause!—one word!—
whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless
toilings? Speak, weaver!—stay thy hand!—but one single word with thee! Nay
—the shuttle flies—the figures float from forth the loom; the freshet-rushing
carpet for ever slides away . The weaver -god, he weaves; and by that weaving is
he deafened, that he hears no mortal voice; and by that humming, we, too, who
look on the loom are deafened; and only when we escape it shall we hear the
thousand voices that speak through it. For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles; those same
words are plainly heard without the walls, bursting from the opened casements. Thereby have villain ies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in all
this din of the great world’ s loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar . Now , amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the great,
white, worshipped skeleton lay loungi ng—a gigantic idler! Yet, as the ever-
woven verdant warp  and woof intermix ed and hummed around him, the mighty
idler seem ed the cunning weaver; himself all woven over with the vines; every
month assuming greener , fresher verdu re; but himself a skeleton. Life folded
Death; Death trellised Life; the grim god wived with youthful Life, and begat
him curly-headed glories. Now , when with royal Tranquo I visite d this wondrous whale, and saw the
skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had
issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu. He
laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his
was genuine. To and fro I paced before this skeleton—brushed the vines aside—
broke through the ribs—and with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied
long amid  its many winding, shaded colonnades and arbours. But soon my line
was out; and follow ing it back, I emer ged from the opening where I entered. I
saw no living thing within; naught was there but bones. Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the skeleton. From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me taking the altitude of
the final rib, “How now!” they shoute d; “Dar ’st thou measure this our god! That’ s for us.” “Aye, priests—well, how long do ye make him, then?” But
hereupon a fierce contest rose among them, concerning feet and inches; they
cracked each other ’s sconces with their yard-sticks—the great skull echoed—
and seizing that lucky chance, I quickly concluded my own admeasurements. These admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be it
recorded, that, in this matter , I am not free to utter any fancied measurement I
please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to, to test my
accuracy . There is a Leviathanic Museu m, they tell me, in Hull, England, one of
the whaling ports of that country , where they have some fine specimens of fin-
backs and other whales. Likewise, I have heard that in the museum of
Manchester , in New Hampshire, they have what the proprietors call “the only
perfect specimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the United States.”
Moreover , at a place  in Yorkshire, Engla nd, Burton Constable by name, a certain
Sir Clifford Constab le has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but
of moderate size, by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend King
Tranquo’ s. In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged,
were origi nally claimed by their proprie tors upon similar grounds. King Tranquo
seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir Clifford, because he was lord of the
seignories of those parts. Sir Clifford’ s whale has been articulated throughout; so
that, like a great chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 276/353cavities—spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan—and swing all day upon his
lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and shutters; and a
footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side. Sir
Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the
spinal column; three pence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum; and
sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead. The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim
from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild wanderings at that
period, there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics. But
as I was crowded for space, and wished the other parts of my body to remain a
blank page for a poem I was then composing—at least, what untattooed parts
might remain—I did not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should
inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale. CHAPTER 103. Measur ement of
The Whale’ s Skeleton. In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular , plain statement,
touching the living  bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton we are briefly to
exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here. According to a caref ul calculation I have made, and which I partly base upon
Captain Scoresby’ s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized Greenland
whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful calculation, I say, a Sperm
Whale of the largest magnitude, between eighty-five and ninety feet in length ,
and somet hing less than forty feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will
weigh at least ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would
considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one
thousand one hundred inhabitants. Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this
leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman’ s imagination? Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole, jaw,
teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now simply point out
what is most interes ting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones. But as the
colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the
skeleton; as it is by far the most complicated part; and as nothing is to be
repeated concerning it in this chapter , you must not fail to carry it in your mind,
or under your arm, as we proceed, other wise you will not gain a complete notion
of the general structure we are about to view . In length, the Sperm  Whale’ s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two feet;
so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have been ninety feet
long; for in the whal e, the skeleton loses  about one fifth in length compared with
the living body . Of this seventy-two feet, his skull and jaw comprised some
twenty feet, leaving  some fifty feet of plain back-bone. Attached to this back -
bone, for something  less than a third of its length, was the mighty circular basket
of ribs which once enclosed his vitals. To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine, extending
far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled the hull of a great ship6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 277/353new-laid upon the stocks, when only some twenty of her naked bow-ribs are
inserted, and the keel is otherwise, for the time, but a long, disconnected timber . The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was nearly six
feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each successively longer , till you
came to the climax of the fifth, or one of the middle ribs, which measured eight
feet and some inches. From that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth
and last only spanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all
bore a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most
arched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay
footpath bridges over small streams. In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the
circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale is
by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of the Tranque ribs, one
of the middle ones,  occupied that part of the fish which, in life, is greatest in
depth. Now , the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must
have been  at least sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but
little more than eight feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion
of the living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now saw but
a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in
flesh, muscle, blood , and bowels. Still more, for the ample fins, I here saw but a
few disord ered joints; and in place of the weighty and majestic, but boneles s
flukes, an utter blank! How vain and fooli sh, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try to
comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his dead
attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in the heart of
quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes; only on the
profound unbounded sea, can the fully  invested whale be truly and livingly
found out. But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a crane, to pile
its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now it’s done, it looks much
like Pompey’ s Pillar . There are forty and odd vertebræ in all, which in the skeleton are not locked
together . They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Gothic spire,
forming solid courses of heavy masonry . The largest, a middle one, is in width
something less than three feet, and in depth more than four. The smallest, where
the spine tapers away into the tail, is only two inches in width, and looks
something like a white billiard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones,
but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest’ s children, who
had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the spine of even
the hugest of living things tapers of f at last into simple child’ s play . CHAPTER 104. The Fossil Whale. From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to
enlar ge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not compress
him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial folio. Not to tell
over again  his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and the yards he measures about the
waist; only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines, where they lie in6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

a line-of-battle-ship. Since I have under taken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me to
approve myself omnisciently exhaustiv e in the enterprise; not overlooking the
minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him out to the uttermost coil
of his bowels. Havi ng already described him in most of his present habitatory
and anatom ical peculiarities, it now remains to magnify him in an archæological ,
fossiliferous, and antediluvian point of view . Applied to any other creature than
the Leviathan—to an ant or a flea—su ch portly terms might justly be deemed
unwarrantably grand iloquent. But when Leviathan is the text, the case is altered. Fain am I to stagger  to this emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary . And here be it said, that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the
course of these dissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of
Johnson, expressly purchased for that purpose; because that famous
lexicographer ’s unco mmon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon
to be used by a whale author like me. One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject, though it may
seem but an ordinary one. How , then, with me, writing of this Leviathan? Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals. Give me a
condor ’s quill! Give  me Vesuvius’  crater  for an inkstand! Friends, hold my arms ! For in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me,
and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to
include the whole circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and
men, and mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving
panoramas of empire on earth, and throu ghout the whole universe, not excluding
its suburbs. Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal theme !","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"We expan d to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty
theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea, though
many there be who have tried it. Ere enterin g upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my credentials as a
geologist, by stating that in my miscell aneous time I have been a stone-mason,
and also a great digger of ditches, canals and wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and
cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by way of preliminary , I desire to remind the
reader , that while in the earlier geologi cal strata there are found the fossils of
monsters now almost completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in
what are called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate
intercepted links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose remote
posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto
discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last preceding the
superficial formation s. And though none  of them precisely answer to any known
species of the prese nt time, they are yet sufficiently akin to them in genera l
respects, to justify their taking rank as Cetacean fossils. Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones and
skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals, been found at the
base of the Alps, in Lombardy , in France, in England, in Scotland, and in the
States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Among the more curious of such
remains is part of a skull, which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue
Dauphine in Paris, a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the
Tuileries; and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in
Napoleon’ s time. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some
utterly unknown Leviathanic species. But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost complete
vast skeleton of an extinct monster , found in the year 1842, on the plantation of6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels. The Alabama doctors declared it
a huge reptile, and bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some
specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist ,
it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed species . A significant illustration of the fact, again and again repeated in this book, that
the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully
invested body. So Owen rechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his pape r
read before the London Geological Society, pronounced it, in substance, one of
the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted
out of existence. When I stand amon g these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks, jaws,
ribs, and vertebræ, all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing
breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same  time bearing on the other hand simila r
affinities to the annihilated antichronical Leviathans, their incalculable seniors; I
am, by a flood, borne back to that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to
have begun; for time began with man. Here Saturn’ s grey chaos rolls over me,
and I obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when wedged
bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics; and in all the 25,000
miles of this world’ s circumference, not an inhabitable hand’ s breadth of land
was visible. Then the whole world was the whale’ s; and, king of creation, he left
his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who can
show a pedigree like Leviathan? Ahab’ s harpoon had shed older blood than the
Pharaoh’ s. Methuselah seems a school-boy . I look round to shake hands with
Shem. I am horro r-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced existence of the
unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been before all time, must needs
exist after all humane ages are over . But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the stereotype
plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust; but upon
Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost
fossiliferous charact er, we find the unmistakable print of his fin. In an apartment
of the great temple of Denderah, some  fifty years ago, there was discovered
upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in
centaurs, griffins, and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial
globe of the moderns. Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was
there swimming in that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was cradled. Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the
whale, in his own osseous post-diluvia n reality , as set down by the venerable
John Leo, the old Barbary traveller . “Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams of
which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes
cast up dead upon that shore. The Com mon People imagine, that by a secret
Power bestowed by God upon the Temple, no Whale can pass it without
immediate death. But the truth of the Matter is, that on either side of the Temple ,
there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea, and wound the Whales when
they light upon ’em. They keep a Whale’ s Rib of an incredible length for a
Miracle, which lying  upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost, makes an
Arch, the Head of which cannot be reach ed by a Man upon a Camel’ s Back. This
Rib (says John Leo) is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their Historians affirm, that a Prophet who prophesy’d of Mahomet, came from
this Temple, and some do not stand to assert, that the Prophet Jonas was cast
forth by the Whale at the Base of the Temple.”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

Nantucketer , and a whaleman, you will silently worship there. CHAPTER 105. Does the Whale’ s
Magnitude Diminish?—W ill He
Perish? Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the
head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether , in the long
course of his genera tions, he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his
sires. But upon investigati on we find, that not only are the whales of the present day
superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the Tertiary
system (embracing a distinct geological period prior to man), but of the whales
found in that Tertiary system, those belonging to its latter formations exceed in
size those of its earlier ones. Of all the pre-adami te whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the Alabama
one mentioned in the last chapter , and that was less than seventy feet in length in
the skelet on. Whereas, we have alrea dy seen, that the tape-measure gives
seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale. And I have
heard, on whalemen’ s authority , that Sperm Whales have been captured near a
hundred feet long at the time of capture. But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in
magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may it not be, that
since Adam’ s time they have degenerated? Assuredly , we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such
gentlemen as Pliny , and the ancient naturalists generally . For Pliny tells us of
whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others which
measured eight hundred feet in length —Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of
Whales! And even in the days of Banks and Solander , Cooke’ s naturalists, we
find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland
Whales (reydan-sisk ur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards;
that is, three hundre d and sixty feet. And Lacépède, the French naturalist, in his
elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his work (page 3), sets
down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eigh t
feet. And this work was published so late as A.D.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"1825. But will any whalem an believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is as
big as his ancestors in Pliny’ s time. And if ever I go where Pliny is, I, a
whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so. Because I canno t
understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried
thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not measure so much in their
coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks; and while the cattle and other
animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative
proportions in which they are drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred,
stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude
the fattest of Pharaoh’ s fat kine; in the face of all this, I will not admit that of all
animals the whale alone should have degenerated.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 281/353But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more recondite
Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs at the mast-
heads of the whale- ships, now penetrating even through Behring’ s straits, and
into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world; and the thousand
harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts; the moot point is,
whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc ;
whether he must not at last be extermin ated from the waters, and the last whale ,
like the last man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final
puff. Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,
which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of
Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and scowled with their
thunder -clotted brow s upon the sites of populous river-capitals, where now the
polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch; in such a comparison an
irresistible argument would seem furnished, to show that the hunted whale
cannot now escape speedy extinction. But you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a period ago
—not a good lifetime—the census of the buffalo in Illinois exceeded the census
of men now in London, and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of
them remains in all that region; and though the cause of this wondrous
extermination was the spear of man; yet the far different nature of the whale -
hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan. Forty men in
one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for forty-eight months think they have done
extremely well, and thank God, if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the days of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the
West, when the far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness and a
virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number of months,
mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain not forty , but
forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could be statistically
stated. Nor, consi dered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual
extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former years (the latter part
of the last century , say) these Leviathans, in small pods, were encountered much
oftener than at present, and, in consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged,
and were also much more remunerative. Because, as has been elsewhere noticed,
those whales, influenced by some views to safety , now swim the seas in
immense caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes, and
pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely
separated, unfreque nt armies. That is all. And equally fallacious seems the
conceit, that because the so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many
grounds in former years abounding with them, hence that species also is
declining. For they are only being driven from promontory to cape; and if one
coast is no longer enlivened with their jets, then, be sure, some other and
remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle. Furthermore: concer ning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two firm
fortresses, which, in all human probab ility, will for ever remain impregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valley s, the frosty Swiss have retreated to their
mountains; so, hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas, the
whale-bone whales can at last resort to their Polar citadels, and diving under the
ultimate glassy barriers and walls there, come up among icy fields and floes; and
in a charmed circle of everlasting December , bid defiance to all pursuit from
man.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 282/353But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one
cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive
havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions. But though for
some time past a number of these whales, not less than 13,000, have been
annually slain on the nor’ west coast by the Americans alone; yet there are
considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an
opposing ar gument in this matter . Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of
the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to Harto, the
historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the King of Siam took
4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle
in the temperate climes. And there seems no reason to doubt that if these
elephants, which have now been hunted for thousands of years, by Semiramis ,
by Porus, by Hannib al, and by all the successive monarchs of the East—if they
still survive there in great numbers, much more may the great whale outlast all
hunting, since he has a pasture to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large
as all Asia, both Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles of
the sea combined. Moreover: we are to consider , that from the presumed great longevity of
whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more, therefore at any
one period  of time, several distinct adult generations must be contemporary . And
what that is, we may soon gain some idea of, by imagining all the grave-yards ,
cemeteries, and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the
men, women, and children who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding
this countless host to the present human population of the globe. Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his species,
however perishable in his individuality . He swam the seas before the continents
broke water; he once swam over the site of the Tuileries, and Windsor Castle,
and the Kremlin. In Noah’ s flood he despised Noah’ s Ark; and if ever the world
is to be again flooded, like the Netherl ands, to kill off its rats, then the eterna l
whale will still survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial
flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies. CHAPTER 106.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Ahab’ s Leg. The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel
Enderby of London , had not been unattended with some small violence to his
own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his
ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when after gaining his own
deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so vehemently wheeled round with an
urgent command to the steersman (it was, as ever, something about his not
steering inflexibly enough); then, the already shaken ivory received such an
additional twist and wrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all
appearances lusty , yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy . And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder , that for all his pervading,
mad reckl essness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that
dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not been very long prior to the
Pequod’ s sailing from Nantucket, that he had been found one night lying prone
upon the ground, and insensible; by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 283/353unimaginable casual ty, his ivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it
had stake-wise smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme
difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured. Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all the
anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe;
and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh
perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove; so,
equally with every felicity , all miserable events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than equally , thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of
Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of this:
that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings, that while some natural
enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world, but, on
the contrary , shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all hell’s despair ;
whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an
eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave; not at all to hint of
this, there still seem s an inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing. For,
thought Ahab, while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain
unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic
significance, and, in some men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their diligen t
tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction. To trail the genealogies of these
high mortal miseries, carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of
the gods; so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft
cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that the gods
themselves are not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark in the brow of
man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers. Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more
properly , in set way, have been disclosed before. With many other particular s
concerning Ahab, always had it remaine d a mystery to some, why it was, that for
a certain period, both before and after the sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden
himself away with such Grand-Lama -like exclusiveness; and, for that one
interval, sought speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the
dead. Captain Peleg’ s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means
adequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab’ s deeper part, every revelation
partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light. But, in the end, it
all came out; this one matter did, at least. That direful mishap was at the bottom
of his temporary recluseness. And not only this, but to that ever-contracting ,
dropping circle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed the privilege of a less
banned approach to him; to that timid circle the above hinted casualty—
remaining, as it did, moodily unaccou nted for by Ahab—invested itself with
terrors, not entirely  underived from the land of spirits and of wails. So that,
through their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so far as in them lay, to muffle
up the knowledge of this thing from others; and hence it was, that not till a
considerable interval had elapsed, did it transpire upon the Pequod’ s decks. But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air, or the
vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not with earthly Ahab,
yet, in this present matter of his leg, he took plain practical procedures;—he
called the carpenter . And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without delay
set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him supplied with all
the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which had thus far been
accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful selection of the stoutest,
clearest-grained stuff might be secured. This done, the carpenter received orders
to have the leg completed that night; and to provide all the fittings for it,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 284/353independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use. Moreover , the ship’ s
forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and, to
accelerate the affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the
forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed. CHAPTER 107.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Carpenter . Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high abstracted
man alone; and he seems a wonder , a grandeur , and a woe. But from the same
point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they seem a mob of
unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary . But most humble
though he was, and far from furnish ing an example of the high, humane
abstraction; the Pequod’ s carpenter was no duplicate; hence, he now comes in
person on this stage. Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging to
whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent, alike
experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own; the
carpenter ’s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those
numerous handicraf ts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary
material. But, besid es the application to him of the generic remark above, this
carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameles s
mechanical emer gencies continually recurring in a large ship, upon a three or
four years’  voyage, in uncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his
readiness in ordinary duties:—repairing  stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the
shape of clumsy-bla ded oars, inserting bull’s eyes in the deck, or new tree-nail s
in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to
his special business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of
conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious. The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold, was
his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices, of
different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times except when whales
were alongside, this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of
the Try-works. A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole: the
carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and straightway files it
smaller . A lost land-bird of strange plumage strays on board, and is made a
captive: out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm
whale ivory , the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman
sprains his wrist: the carpenter concoc ts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for
vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar
in his big vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation. A
sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone  ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears. Another has the toothache: the carpen ter out pincers, and clapping one hand
upon his bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow unmanageably
winces under the unconcluded operation; whirling round the handle of his
wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have
him draw the tooth. Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent and
without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he deemed but6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 285/353top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But while now upon so
wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness
in him, too; all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of
intelligence. But not precisely so. For nothing was this man more remarkable ,
than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so
shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the
general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while pauselessly
active in uncounted  modes, still eternally holds its peace, and ignores you,
though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in
him, involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying heartlessness;—yet was it
oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing
humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness;
such as might have  served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the
bearded forecastle of Noah’ s ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-
long wand erer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no moss ;
but what is more, had rubbed off whate ver small outward clingings might have
originally pertained to him? He was a stript abstract; an unfractioned integral ;
uncompromised as a new-born babe; living without premeditated reference to
this world or the next. You might almost say, that this strange
uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence; for in his
numerous trades, he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct, or
simply because he had been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these,
even or uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal
process. He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have
early ooze d along into the muscles of his fingers. He was like one of those
unreasoning but still highly useful, multum in parvo , Sheffield contrivances,
assuming the exterior—though a little swelled—of a common pocket knife; but
containing, not only blades of various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws,
tweezers, awls, pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superior s
wanted to use the carpenter for a screw -driver , all they had to do was to open
that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by the
legs, and there they were. Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter , was, after
all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a common soul in him,
he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty. What that
was, whether essence of quicksilver , or a few drops of hartshorn, there is no
telling. But there it was; and there it had abided for now some sixty years or
more. And this it was, this same unacc ountable, cunning life-principle in him;
this it was, that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an
unreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather , his body was
a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the time to keep
himself awake. CHAPTER 108.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

sometimes, they say; but that’s only haphazard-like. Then, a short, little old body
like me, should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall, heron-
built captains; the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick, and there’ s a
great cry for life-boats. And here’ s the heron’ s leg! long and slim, sure enough! Now , for most folks  one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be because
they use them mercifully , as a tender -hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old
coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he’s a hard driver . Look, driven one leg to death ,
and spavined the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the cord. Halloa,

the resurre ction fellow comes a-calling with his horn for all legs, true or false, as
brewery-men go round collecting old beer barrels, to fill ’em up again. What a

be standin g on this to-morrow; he’ll be taking altitudes on it. Halloa! I almost
forgot the little oval slate, smoothed ivory , where he figures up the latitude. So,
so; chisel, file, and sand-paper , now! CHAPTER 109. Ahab and
Starbuck in the Cabin. According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo! no
inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must have sprung a
bad leak. Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went down into the cabin to
report this unfavourable af fair.*
*In Sperm-whaleme n with any conside rable quantity of oil on board, it is a
regular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and drench the casks
with sea-w ater; which afterwards, at varying intervals, is removed by the ship’ s
pumps. Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight; while by the
changed character of the withdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any
serious leakage in the precious car go. Now , from  the South and West the Pequ od was drawing nigh to Formosa and
the Bashee  Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the China
waters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck  found Ahab with a general chart of the
oriental archipelagoes spread before him; and another separate one representing
the long eastern coasts of the Japanese islands—Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke . With his snow-white new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table ,
and with a long pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 289/353with his back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow , and tracing his old
courses again. “Who’ s there?” hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning round to it. “On deck! Begone!”
“Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir. We must up
Burtons and break out.”
“Up Burtons and break out? Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to here for
a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?”
“Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a
year. What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving, sir .”
“So it is, so it is; if we get it.”
“I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir .”
“And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Let it leak! I’m all
aleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky casks, but those leaky
casks are in a leaky  ship; and that’s a far worse plight than the Pequod’ s, man. Yet I don’t stop to plug my leak; for who can find it in the deep-loaded hull; or
how hope to plug it, even if found, in this life’s howling gale? Starbuck! I’ll not
have the Burtons hoisted.”
“What will the owners say , sir?”
“Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons. What
cares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art always prating to me, Starbuck, about
those miserly owners, as if the owners  were my conscience. But look ye, the
only real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye, my conscience is in
this ship’ s keel.—On deck!”
“Captain Ahab,” said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin, with
a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only
every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself, but
within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself; “A better man than I
might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger
man; aye, and in a happier , Captain Ahab.”
“Devils! Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me?—On
deck!”
“Nay , sir, not yet; I do entreat. And I do dare, sir—to be forbearing! Shall we
not understand each other better than hitherto, Captain Ahab?”
Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most South-Sea-
men’ s cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck, exclaimed: “There is
one God that is Lord over the earth, and one Captain that is lord over the
Pequod.—On deck!”
For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks, you
would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled
tube. But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and as he quitted the
cabin, paused for an instant and said: “Thou hast outraged, not insulted me, sir;
but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let
Ahab beware of Ahab; beware of thyself, old man.”
“He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!”
murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappear ed. “What’ s that he said—Ahab beware
of Ahab—there’ s something there!” Then unconsciously using the musket for a
staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin; but presently the
thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and returning the gun to the rack, he went to
the deck.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 290/353“Thou art but too good a fellow , Starbu ck,” he said lowly to the mate; then
raising his voice to the crew: “Furl the t’gallant-sails, and close-reef the top-
sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton, and break out in the main -
hold.”
It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting
Starbuck, Ahab thus acted. It may have been a flash of honesty in him; or mere
prudential policy which, under the circumstance, imperiously forbade the
slightest symptom of open disaf fection, however transient, in the important chief
officer of his ship. However it was, his orders were executed; and the Burtons
were hoisted. CHAPTER 1 10.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Queequeg in His
Coffin. Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were
perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. So, it being calm weather ,
they broke out deeper and deeper , disturbing the slumbers of the huge ground-
tier butts; and from that black midnigh t sending those gigantic moles into the
daylight above. So deep did they go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy
the aspect  of the lowermost puncheons , that you almost looked next for some
mouldy corner-stone cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the
posted placards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood. Tierce
after tierce , too, of water , and bread, and beef, and shooks of staves, and iron
bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the piled decks were hard to get
about; and the hollow hull echoed under foot, as if you were treading over empty
catacombs, and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn. Top-
heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in his head. Well
was it that the Typhoons did not visit them then. Now , at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast bosom-
friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever , which brought him nigh to his
endless end. Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown; dignity
and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the higher you rise the
harder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as harpooneer , must not only face
all the rage of the living whale, but—as we have elsewhere seen—mount his
dead back  in a rolling sea; and finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and
bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely
manhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage. To be short, among
whalemen, the harpooneers are the holders, so called. Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should
have stooped over the hatchway , and peered down upon him there; where ,
stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about amid
that dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well. And
a well, or an ice-hou se, it somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where, strange to
say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into
a fever; and at last, after some days’  suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to
the very sill of the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those few
long-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 291/353tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper , his
eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became of a strange
softness of lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his
sickness, a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not
die, or be weakened . And like circles on the water , which, as they grow fainter ,
expand; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity . An
awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this
waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld who were
bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in
man, neve r yet was put into words or books. And the drawing near of Death ,
which alike levels all, alike impresses all with a last revelation, which only an
author from the dead could adequately tell. So that—let us say it again—no
dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose
mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he
quietly lay in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking
him to his final rest, and the ocean’ s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and
higher towards his destined heaven. Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself, what
he though t of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked. He
called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was just breaking ,
and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had chanced to see certain
little cano es of dark wood, like the rich war-wood of his native isle; and upon
inquiry , he had learned that all whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in
those same dark canoes, and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased
him; for it was not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a
dead warrior , stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated away
to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the stars are isles,
but that far beyond  all visible horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas,
interflow with the blue heavens; and so form the white breakers of the milky
way. He added, that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his
hammock, according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the
death-devouring sharks. No: he desired  a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the
more cong enial to him, being a whalem an, that like a whale-boat these coffin-
canoes were without a keel; though that involved but uncertain steering, and
much lee-way adown the dim ages. Now , when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter was
at once commanded  to do Queequeg’ s bidding, whatever it might include. There
was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard, which, upon a long
previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday
islands, and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made. No
sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order , than taking his rule, he forthwith
with all the indifferent promptitude of his character , proceeded into the
forecastle and took Queequeg’ s measure with great accuracy , regularly chalking
Queequeg’ s person as he shifted the rule. “Ah!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"poor fellow! he’ll have to die now ,” ejaculated the Long Island sailor . Going to his vice-b ench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general
reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to
be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its
extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools, and to work. When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he lightly
shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring whether they were
ready for it yet in that direction.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 292/353Overhearing the indignant but half-hum orous cries with which the people on
deck bega n to drive the coffin away , Queequeg, to every one’s consternation,
commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him, nor was there any
denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some dying men are the most
tyrannical; and certainly , since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore,
the poor fellows ought to be indulged. Leaning over in his hammock, Queequ eg long regarded the coffin with an
attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn from
it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of
his boat. All by his own request, also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides
within: a flask of fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody
earth scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up
for a pillow , Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he migh t
make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving a few minutes,
then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god, Yojo. Then crossing his
arms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he
called it) to be placed over him. The head part turned over with a leather hinge,
and there lay Queeq ueg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in
view . “Rarmai” (it will do; it is easy),  he murmured at last, and signed to be
replaced in his hammock. But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all this while,
drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took him by the hand; in
the other , holding his tambourine. “Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"where go ye
now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the beaches are
only beat with water -lilies, will ye do one little errand for me? Seek out one Pip,
who’ s now been missing long: I think he’s in those far Antilles. If ye find him,
then comf ort him; for he must be very sad; for look! he’s left his tambourine
behind;—I found it. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now , Queequeg, die; and I’ll beat ye
your dying march.”
“I have heard,” murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, “that in violent
fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues; and that when the
mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood
those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty
scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor Pip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy ,
brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes. Where learned he that, but
there?—Hark! he speaks again: but more wildly now .”
“Form two and two! Let’s make a General of him! Ho, where’ s his harpoon? Lay it across here.— Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game cock now to sit
upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!—mind ye that; Queequeg dies
game!—take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies game! I say; game, game,
game! but base little Pip, he died a coward; died all a’shiver;—out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the Antill es he’s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a
coward! Tell them he jumped from a whale-boat! I’d never beat my tambourine
over base Pip, and hail him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame upon all cowards—shame upon them! Let ’em go drown like Pip, that
jumped from a whale-boat. Shame! shame!”
During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip was led
away , and the sick man was replaced in his hammock. But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now that
his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon there seemed
no need of the carpenter ’s box: and thereupon, when some expressed their6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 293/353delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his sudden
convalescence was this;—at a critical moment, he had just recalled a little duty
ashore, which he was leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about
dying: he could not die yet, he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or
die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly . In a word, it was Queequeg’ s conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live,
mere sickn ess could  not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent,
ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort. Now , there is this noteworthy differenc e between savage and civilized; that
while a sick, civilize d man may be six months convalescing, generally speaking ,
a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day. So, in good time my Queequeg
gained strength; and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolen t
days (but eating with a vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw
out his arms and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little bit, and
then springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon ,
pronounced himself fit for a fight. With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and emptying
into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there. Many spare hours he
spent, in carving the lid with all manner  of grotesque figures and drawings; and
it seemed that hereby he was striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the
twisted tattooing on his body . And this tattooing had been the work of a departed
prophet and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out
on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical
treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his own proper person
was a riddle to unfol d; a wondrous work in one volume; but whose mysteries not
even himself could read, though his own live heart beat against them; and these
mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living
parchment whereon they were inscribed , and so be unsolved to the last. And this
thought it must have  been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his,
when one morning turning away from surveying poor Queequeg—“Oh, devilish
tantalization of the gods!”
CHAPTER 1 11. The Pacific. When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South
Sea; were  it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear Pacific with
uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my youth was answered; that
serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue. There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently
awful stirrings seem  to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those fabled
undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St. John. And meet it
is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery prairies and Potters’  Fields
of all four continents, the waves should rise and fall, and ebb and flow
unceasingly; for here, millions of mixed  shades and shadows, drowned dreams,
somnambulisms, reveries; all that we call lives and souls, lie dreaming,
dreaming, still; tossing like slumberers in their beds; the ever-rolling waves but
made so by their restlessness. To any meditative Magian rover , this serene Pacific, once beheld, must ever
after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of the world, the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 294/353Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same waves wash the moles of
the new-built Californian towns, but yesterday planted by the recentest race of
men, and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than
Abraham; while all between float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying ,
endless, unknown Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans. Thus this
mysterious, divine Pacific zones the world’ s whole bulk about; makes all coasts
one bay to it; seems the tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those eternal
swells, you needs must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan. But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab’ s brain, as standing like an iron statue at
his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one nostril he unthinkingly
snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles (in whose sweet woods mild
lovers must be walking), and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath
of the new found sea; that sea in which the hated White Whale must even then
be swimm ing. Launched at length upon these almost final waters, and gliding
towards the Japanese cruising-ground, the old man’ s purpose intensified itself . His firm lips met like the lips of a vice; the Delta of his forehead’ s veins swelled
like overladen brooks; in his very sleep, his ringing cry ran through the vaulted
hull, “Stern all! the White Whale spouts thick blood!”
CHAPTER 1 12. The Blacksmith. Availing himself of the mild, summer -cool weather that now reigned in these
latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be
anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old blacksmith, had not removed his
portable forge to the hold again, after concluding his contributory work for
Ahab’ s leg, but still retained it on deck,  fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast ;
being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and
bowsmen to do some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping
their vario us weapo ns and boat furnitur e. Often he would be surrounded by an
eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons ,
and lances, and jealously watching his every sooty movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man’ s was a patie nt hammer wielded by a patient arm. No
murmur , no impatience, no petulance did come from him. Silent, slow, and
solemn; bowing over still further his chronically broken back, he toiled away , as
if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of
his heart. And so it was.—Most miserable! A peculiar  walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing yawing
in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the
mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally
given in; and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of
his wretched fate. Belated, and not innocently , one bitter winter’s midnight, on the road running
between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt the deadly
numbness stealing over him, and sough t refuge in a leaning, dilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both feet. Out of this revelation, part
by part, at last came out the four acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as
yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life’ s drama. He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty , had postponedly
encountered that thing in sorrow’ s technicals called ruin. He had been an artisan6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

embraced a youthful, daughter -like, loving wife, and three blithe, ruddy
children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church, planted in a grove . But one night, under cover of darkness, and further concealed in a most cunning
disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into his happy home, and robbed them all
of everyth ing. And darker yet to tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly
conduct this burglar into his family’ s heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the
opening of that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now ,
for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith’ s shop was in the
basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so that always had
the young  and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness, but
with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband’ s
hammer; whose reverberations, muffled by passing through the floors and walls ,
came up to her, not unsweetly , in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor ’s iron
lullaby , the blacksmith’ s infants were rocked to slumber . Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst  thou not sometimes be timely? Hadst
thou taken  this old blacksmith to thyse lf ere his full ruin came upon him, then
had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a truly venerable,
legendary sire to dream of in their after years; and all of them a care-killing
competency . But Death plucked down some virtuous elder brother , on whose
whistling daily toil solely hung the respo nsibilities of some other family , and left
the worse than usele ss old man standing , till the hideous rot of life should make
him easier to harvest. Why tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more
and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last; the wife
sat frozen at the window , with tearless eyes, glitteringly gazing into the weeping
faces of her children; the bellows fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the
house was sold; the mother dived down into the long church-yard grass; her
children twice followed her thither; and the houseless, familyless old man
staggered off a vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a
scorn to flaxen curls! Death seem s the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death is only
a launchin g into the region of the strang e Untried; it is but the first salutation to
the possib ilities of the immense Remo te, the Wild, the Watery , the Unshored;
therefore, to the death-longing eyes of such men, who still have left in them
some interior compunctions against suicide, does the all-contributed and all-
receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable, taking
terrors, and wonderful, new-life adven tures; and from the hearts of infinite
Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to them—“Come hither , broken-hearted;
here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death; here are wonders
supernatural, without dying for them. Come hither!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"bury thyself in a life which,
to your now equally abhorred and abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious
than death. Come hither! put up thy gravestone, too, within the churchyard, and
come hither , till we marry thee!”
Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by fall of
eve, the blacksmith’ s soul responded, Aye, I come! And so Perth went a-whaling. CHAPTER 1 13. The Forge.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 296/353With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about mid-
day, Perth was stand ing between his forge and anvil, the latter placed upon an
iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the coals, and with the
other at his forge’s lungs, when Captain Ahab came along, carrying in his hand a
small rusty-looking leathern bag. While yet a little distance from the forge,
moody Ahab paused; till at last, Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began
hammering it upon the anvil—the red mass sending off the sparks in thick
hovering flights, some of which flew close to Ahab. “Are these  thy Mother Carey’ s chickens, Perth? they are always flying in thy
wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;—look here, they burn; but thou—
thou liv’ st among them without a scorch.”
“Because I am scorc hed all over, Captai n Ahab,” answered Perth, resting for a
moment on his hammer; “I am past scorching; not easily can’st thou scorch a
scar.”
“Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice  sounds too calmly , sanely woeful to
me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others that is not mad. Thou should’ st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou not go mad? How can’st
thou endure without being mad? Do the heavens yet hate thee, that thou can’st
not go mad?—What wert thou making there?”
“Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.”
“And can’st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard usage
as it had?”
“I think so, sir .”
“And I suppose thou can’st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never mind
how hard the metal, blacksmith?”
“Aye, sir , I think I can; all seams and dents but one.”
“Look ye here, then,” cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning with
both hands on Perth’ s shoulders; “look  ye here— here—can ye smoothe out a
seam like this, blacksmith,” sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow; “if thou
could’ st, blacksmith , glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil, and feel
thy heavie st hammer between my eyes. Answer! Can’ st thou smoothe this
seam?”
“Oh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?”
“Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for though thou
only see’st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into the bone of my skull—
that is all wrinkles! But, away with child’ s play; no more gaffs and pikes to-day . Look ye here!” jingling the leathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins. “I, too,
want a harpoon made; one that a thousa nd yoke of fiends could not part, Perth ;
something that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone. There’ s the stuff,”
flinging the pouch upon the anvil. “Loo k ye, blacksmith, these are the gathered
nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses.”
“Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why , Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the best
and stubbornest stuf f we blacksmiths ever work.”
“I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted
bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me first, twelve
rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these twelve together like
the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I’ll blow the fire.”
When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by
spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. “A flaw!”
rejecting the last one. “W ork that over again, Perth.”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 297/353This done , Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when Ahab
stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then, with regular ,
gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to him the glowing rods,
one after the other , and the hard presse d forge shooting up its intense straight
flame, the Parsee passed silently , and bowing over his head towards the fire,
seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab looked
up, he slid aside. “What’ s that bunch of lucifers dodgin g about there for?” muttered Stubb,
looking on from the forecastle. “That Parsee smells fire like a fusee; and smell s
of it himself, like a hot musket’ s powder -pan.”
At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as Perth, to
temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by, the scalding steam
shot up into Ahab’ s bent face. “Would’ st thou brand me, Perth?” wincing for a moment with the pain; “have
I been but for ging my own branding-iron, then?”
“Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this harpoon
for the White Whale?”
“For the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them thyself,
man. Here  are my razors—the best of steel; here, and make the barbs sharp as
the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.”
For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not
use them. “Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup, nor
pray till—but here—to work!”
Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the shank, the
steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the blacksmith was about giving
the barbs their final heat, prior to tempe ring them, he cried to Ahab to place the
water -cask near . “No, no—no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper . Ahoy , there!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Tashtego, Queequeg , Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me as much
blood as will cover this barb?” holding it high up. A cluster of dark nods replied,
Yes. Three  puncture s were made in the heathen flesh, and the White Whale’ s
barbs were then tempered. “Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!” deliriously
howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood. Now , mustering the spare poles from below , and selecting one of hickory ,
with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron. A
coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some fathoms of it taken to the
windlass, and stretched to a great tensio n. Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope
hummed like a harp-string, then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no
strandings, Ahab exclaimed, “Good! and now for the seizings.”
At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns were
all braided and wove n round the socket of the harpoon; the pole was then driven
hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope was traced half-way along
the pole’s length, and firmly secured so, with intertwistings of twine. This done,
pole, iron, and rope—like the Three Fates—remained inseparable, and Ahab
moodily stalked away with the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound
of the hickory pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered
his cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering , yet most piteous sound was heard. Oh,
Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy strange mummerie s6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

mocked it! CHAPTER 1 14.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Gilder . Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising ground,
the Pequod was soon  all astir in the fishery. Often, in mild, pleasant weather , for
twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on the stretch, they were engaged in
the boats,  steadily pulling, or sailing, or paddling after the whales, or for an
interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising; though with
but small success for their pains. At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow heaving
swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch  canoe; and so sociably mixing with the
soft waves  themselves, that like hearth-stone cats they purr against the gunwale ;
these are the times of dreamy quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and
brilliancy of the ocean’s skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it;
and would not willingly remember , that this velvet paw but conceals a
remorseless fang. These are the times , when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a certain
filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he regards it as so much
flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts, seem s
struggling forward, not through high rolling waves, but through the tall grass of
a rolling prairie: as when the western emigrants’  horses only show their erected
ears, while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure. The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these there
steals the hush, the hum; you almos t swear that play-wearied children lie
sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when the flowers of the
woods are plucked. And all this mixes with your most mystic mood; so that fact
and fancy , half-way meeting, interpenetrate, and form one seamless whole.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary , fail of at least as temporary
an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his
own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing. Oh, grassy  glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in ye,—
though long parched  by the dead drought of the earthy life,—in ye, men yet may
roll, like young horses in new morni ng clover; and for some few fleeting
moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them. Would to God these
blessed calms would  last. But the mingled, mingling threads of life are woven by
warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm. There is no
steady unretracing progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed
gradations, and at the last one pause: —through infancy’ s unconscious spell ,
boyhood’ s thoughtless faith, adolescence’  doubt (the common doom), then
scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood’ s pondering repose of If. But once gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and
men, and Ifs eternal ly. Where lies the final harbor , whence we unmoor no more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will never weary? Where is the foundling’ s father hidden? Our souls are like those orphans whose
unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of our paternity lies in their
grave, and we must there to learn it.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 299/353And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat’ s side into that same
golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:—
“Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride’ s eye!—T ell
me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping cannibal ways. Let faith
oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep down and do believe.”
And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same golden
light:—
“I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths that he has
always been jolly!”
CHAPTER 1 15. The Pequod Meets
The Bachelor . And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down
before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab’ s harpoon had been welded. It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor , which had just wedged in her last cask
of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in glad holiday apparel,
was joyously , though somewhat vain-gloriously , sailing round among the
widely-separated ships on the ground, previous to pointing her prow for home. The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at
their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down; and
hanging captive from  the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale
they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colours were flying from her
rigging, on every side. Sideways lashed  in each of her three basketed tops were
two barrels of sperm ; above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slende r
breakers of the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen
lamp. As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising
success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same seas
numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the
far more valuable sperm, but additional supplemental casks had been bartered
for, from the ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in
the captain’ s and officers’  state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been
knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an
oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the forecastle, the sailor s
had actually caulked and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously
added, that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler , and filled it; that
the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the harpooneers
had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was
filled with sperm, except the captain’ s pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved
to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction. As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the
barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing still
nearer , a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try-pots, which ,
covered with the parchment-like poke  or stomach skin of the black fish, gave
forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew . On the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 300/353quarter -deck, the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls
who had eloped with them from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an
ornamented boat, firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three
Long Islan d negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory , were presiding
over the hilarious jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship’ s company were
tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works, from which the huge pots
had been removed. You would have almost thought they were pulling down the
cursed Bastille, such wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and mortar
were being hurled into the sea. Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the ship’ s
elevated quarter -deck, so that the whol e rejoicing drama was full before him,
and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion. And Ahab , he too was standing on his quarter -deck, shaggy and black, with a
stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other ’s wakes—one all
jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings as to things to come—
their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the
scene. “Come aboard, come aboard!” cried the gay Bachelor ’s commander , lifting a
glass and a bottle in the air . “Hast seen the White Whale?” gritted Ahab in reply . “No; only heard of him; but don’t believe in him at all,” said the other good-
humoredly . “Come aboard!”
“Thou art too damned jolly . Sail on. Hast lost any men?”
“Not enough to speak of—two islanders, that’s all;—but come aboard, old
hearty , come along. I’ll soon take that black from your brow . Come along, will
ye (merry’ s the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.”
“How wondrous familiar is a fool!” muttered Ahab; then aloud, “Thou art a
full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an empty ship,
and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward there! Set all sail,
and keep her to the wind!”
And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other
stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew of the
Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the receding Bachelor; but
the Bache lor’s men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the taffrail, eyed the homeward-bound craft, he took
from his pocket a small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial,
seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together , for that vial was
filled with Nantucket soundings. CHAPTER 1 16. The Dying Whale. Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune’ s favourites sail close
by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the rushing breeze, and
joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed it with the Pequod. For next
day after encountering the gay Bachelor , whales were seen and four were slain;
and one of them by Ahab.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 301/353It was far down the afternoon; and when  all the spearings of the crimson fight
were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky, sun and whale both
stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and such plaintiveness, such
inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air, that it almost seemed as if far over
from the deep green convent valleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-
breeze, wantonly turned sailor , had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper
hymns. Soothed again, but only soothed to deep er gloom, Ahab, who had sterned off
from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil
boat. For that stran ge spectacle observable in all sperm whales dying—the
turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring—that strange spectacle, beheld of
such a placid eveni ng, somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown
before. “He turns and turns him to it,—how slowly, but how steadfastly , his homage-
rendering and invoking brow , with his last dying motions. He too worships fire;
most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!—Oh that these too-favouring
eyes should see these too-favouring sights. Look! here, far water -locked; beyond
all hum of human weal or woe; in these most candid and impartial seas; where to
traditions no rocks furnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows have
still rolled  on speechless and unspoken  to, as stars that shine upon the Niger ’s
unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith; but see! no soone r
dead, than death whirls round the corpse, and it heads some other way . “Oh, thou dark Hind oo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded thy
separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas; thou art an
infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the wide-slaughtering
Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Nor has this thy whale
sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone round again, without a lesson to
me. “Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power! Oh, high aspiring, rainbowed
jet!—that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain! In vain, oh whale, dost thou
seek intercedings with yon all-quickening sun, that only calls forth life, but gives
it not again. Yet dost thou, darker half, rock me with a prouder , if a darker faith. All thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths
of once living things, exhaled as air , but water now . “Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl finds
his only rest. Born  of earth, yet suckled by the sea; though hill and valley
mothered me, ye billows are my foster -brothers!”
CHAPTER 1 17. The Whale Watch. The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to windward;
one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These last three were
brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one could not be reached till
morning; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night; and that boat was
Ahab’ s. The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale’ s spout-hole; and the
lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon the black ,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 302/353glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which gently chafed the
whale’ s broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach. Ahab and all his boat’ s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who crouching in
the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played round the whale, and
tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A sound like the moaning in
squadrons over Asphaltites of unfor given ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering
through the air . Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and hooped
round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world. “I
have dreamed it again,” said he. “Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor coffin can
be thine?”
“And who are hearsed that die on the sea?”
“But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two hearses
must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by mortal hands; and
the visible wood of the last one must be grown in America.”
“Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:— a hearse and its plumes floating over
the ocean with the waves for the pall-be arers. Ha! Such a sight we shall not soon
see.”
“Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.”
“And what was that saying about thyself?”
“Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot.”
“And when thou art so gone before—if that ever befall—then ere I can follow ,
thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?—W as it not so? Well, then, did I
believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here two pledges that I shall yet slay
Moby Dick and survive it.”
“Take another pledge, old man,” said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up like
fire-flies in the gloom—“Hemp only can kill thee.”
“The gallo ws, ye mean.—I am immortal then, on land and on sea,” cried
Ahab, with a laugh of derision;—“Immortal on land and on sea!”
Both were  silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the
slumbering crew arose from the boat’ s bottom, and ere noon the dead whale was
brought to the ship. CHAPTER 1 18.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Quadrant. The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,
coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would
ostentatiously handl e his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to the
braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed
doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship’ s prow for the equator . In
good time the order came. It was hard upon high noon; and Ahab, seated in the
bows of his high-hoisted boat, was abou t taking his wonted daily observation of
the sun to determine his latitude. Now , in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of effulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 303/353ocean’ s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks lacquered; clouds there are
none; the horizon floats; and this nake dness of unrelieved radiance is as the
insuf ferable splendors of God’ s throne. Well that Ahab’ s quadrant was furnished
with coloured glasses, through which  to take sight of that solar fire. So,
swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his astrological-looking
instrument placed to his eye, he remain ed in that posture for some moments to
catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian . Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling
beneath him on the ship’s deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab’ s, was eyeing
the same sun with him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his
wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the desired
observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab soon
calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. Then falling into a
moment’ s revery , he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself:
“Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly where I am—
but canst thou cast the least hint where I shall  be? Or canst thou tell where some
other thing  besides me is this moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This instan t
thou must be eyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even
now beholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the
objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!”
Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other , its numerous
cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered: “Foolish toy! babies ’
plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores, and Captains; the world brags
of thee, of thy cunning and might; but what after all canst thou do, but tell the
poor, pitiful point, where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and
the hand that holds thee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one
drop of water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy
impotence thou insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy; and cursed
be all the things that cast man’ s eyes aloft to that heaven, whose live vividness
but scorch es him, as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light, O sun! Level by nature to this earth’ s horizon are the glances of man’ s eyes; not shot
from the crown of his head, as if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament. Curse thee, thou quadrant!” dashing it to the deck, “no longer will I guide my
earthly way by thee; the level ship’ s compass, and the level dead-reckoning, by
log and by line; these  shall conduct me, and show me my place on the sea. Aye,”
lighting from the boat to the deck, “thus  I trample on thee, thou paltry thing that
feebly pointest on high; thus I split and destroy thee!”
As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead
feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a fatalistic despair that
seemed meant for himself—these passed over the mute, motionless Parsee’ s
face. Unobserved he rose and glided away; while, awestruck by the aspect of
their commander , the seamen clustered  together on the forecastle, till Ahab,
troubledly pacing the deck, shouted out—“T o the braces! Up helm!—square in!”
In an insta nt the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon her
heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her long, ribbed
hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one suf ficient steed. Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod’ s
tumultuous way , and Ahab’ s also, as he went lurching along the deck. “I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow , full of its
tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down, down, to dumbes t

coal, not your common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab mutter , ‘Here some
one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine; swears that I must play
them, and no others.’  And damn me, Ahab, but thou actest right; live in the
game, and die in it!”
CHAPTER 1 19. The Candles. Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal crouches in
spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most effulgent but basket the
deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes that never swept tame
northern lands. So, too, it is, that in these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner
encounters the direst of all storms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from
out that cloudless sky , like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town. Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and bare-
poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly ahead. When
darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the thunder , and blazed with
the lightning, that showed the disabled masts fluttering here and there with the
rags which the first fury of the tempest had left for its after sport. Holding by a shrou d, Starbuck was standing on the quarter -deck; at every
flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional disaster might have
befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb and Flask were directing the
men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats. But all their pains
seemed naught. Though lifted to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter
boat (Ahab’ s) did not escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the
reeling ship’ s high teetering side, stove in the boat’ s bottom at the stern, and left
it again, all dripping through like a sieve. “Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,” said Stubb, regarding the wreck, “but
the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can’t fight it. You see, Mr. Starbuck, a
wave has such a great long start before it leaps, all round the world it runs, and
then comes the sprin g! But as for me, all the start I have to meet it, is just across
the deck here. But never mind; it’ s all in fun: so the old song says;”—( sings .)
  Oh! jolly is the gale,

https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 305/353“Avast Stubb,” cried Starbuck, “let the Typhoon sing, and strike his harp here
in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace.”
“But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward; and
I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr. Starbuck, there’ s no
way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat. And when that’s done,
ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a wind-up.”
“Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.”
“What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never mind
how foolish?”
“Here!” cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder , and pointing his hand
towards the weather bow, “markest thou not that the gale comes from the
eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the very course he
swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where is that stove? In the
stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand—his stand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away , if thou must! “I don’ t half understand ye: what’ s in the wind?”
“Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to Nantucket,”
soliloquized Starbuck suddenly , heedless of Stubb’ s question. “The gale that
now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us
towards home. Yonder, to windward, all is blackness of doom; but to leeward ,
homeward—I see it lightens up there; but not with the lightning.”
At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following the
flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same instant a volley of
thunder peals rolled overhead. “Who’ s there?”
“Old Thun der!” said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot-
hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire. Now , as the lightni ng rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the
perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to
each mast , is intended to conduct it into the water . But as this conductor must
descend to consider able depth, that its end may avoid all contact with the hull;
and as moreover , if kept constantly towing there, it would be liable to many
mishaps, besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging, and more or
less impeding the vessel’ s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts
of a ship’ s lightning -rods are not alway s overboard; but are generally made in
long slend er links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside,
or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require. “The rods! the rods!” cried Starbuck to the crew , suddenly admonished to
vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux, to light
Ahab to his post. “Are they overboard?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"drop them over , fore and aft. Quick!”
“Avast!” cried Ahab; “let’s have fair play here, though we be the weaker side. Yet I’ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and Andes, that all the world
may be secured; but out on privileges! Let them be, sir .”
“Look aloft!” cried Starbuck.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"“The corpusants! the corpusants!”
All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each tri-
pointed lightning-ro d-end with three tapering white flames, each of the three tall
masts was silently burning in that sulph urous air, like three gigantic wax tapers
before an altar . “Blast the boat! let it go!” cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing sea heaved
up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently jammed his hand, as
he was passing a lashing. “Blast it!”—but slipping backward on the deck, his6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 306/353uplifted eyes caught the flames; and immediately shifting his tone he cried
—“The corpusants have mercy on us all!”
To sailors, oaths are household words;  they will swear in the trance of the
calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses from the topsail-
yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething sea; but in all my
voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when God’ s burning finger has
been laid on the ship; when His “Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin” has been woven
into the shrouds and the cordage. While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the
enchanted crew; who in one thick clust er stood on the forecastle, all their eyes
gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away constellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to
thrice his real statur e, and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had
come. The parted mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which
strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by
the preternatural light, Queequeg’ s tattooing burned like Satanic blue flames on
his body . The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more the
Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment or two
passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. It was Stubb. “What thinkest thou now , man; I heard thy cry; it was not the same in the song.”
“No, no, it wasn’ t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I hope they
will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?—have they no bowels for
a laugh? And look ye, Mr.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Starbuck—but it’s too dark to look. Hear me, then: I
take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign of good luck; for those masts are
rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a’ block with sperm-oil, d’ye see; and
so, all that sperm will work up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three
masts will yet be as three spermaceti candles—that’ s the good promise we saw .”
At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb’ s face slowly beginning to
glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: “See! see!” and once more the
high taper ing flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalnes s
in their pallor . “The corpusants have mercy on us all,” cried Stubb, again. At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame, the
Parsee was kneeling in Ahab’ s front, but with his head bowed away from him;
while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where they had just
been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen, arrested by the glare,
now coher ed togethe r, and hung pendulous, like a knot of numbed wasps from a
drooping, orchard twig. In various enchanted attitudes, like the standing, or
stepping, or running skeletons in Herc ulaneum, others remained rooted to the
deck; but all their eyes upcast. “Aye, aye, men!” cried Ahab. “Look up at it; mark it well; the white flame but
lights the way to the White Whale! Hand  me those mainmast links there; I would
fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against it; blood against fire! So.”
Then turni ng—the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot upon the
Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm, he stood erect
before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames. “Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian once did
worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that to this hour I bear the
scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I now know that thy right worship is
defiance. To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind; and e’en for hate thou
canst but kill; and all are killed. No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of the
personified imperso nal, a personality stands here. Though but a point at best;
whencesoe’er I came; wheresoe’er I go; yet while I earthly live, the queenly
personality lives in me, and feels her royal rights. But war is pain, and hate is
woe. Com e in thy lowest form of love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy
highest, come as mere supernal power; and though thou launchest navies of full-
freighted worlds, there’s that in here that still remains indifferent. Oh, thou clear
spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of fire, I breathe it back to
thee.”
[Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap lengthwise to
thrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest, closes his eyes, his right hand
pressed har d upon them. ]
“I own thy speechless, placeless power;  said I not so? Nor was it wrung from
me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind; but I can then grope. Thou
canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the homage of these poor eyes, and
shutter -hands. I would not take it. The lightning flashes through my skull; mine
eye-balls ache and ache; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling
on some stunning ground. Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Ligh t
though thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of
light, leaping out of thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not? There burn
the flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my genealogy . But thou
art but my fiery father; my sweet mothe r, I know not. Oh, cruel! what hast thou
done with her? Ther e lies my puzzle; but thine is greater . Thou knowest not how
came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy beginning,
hence callest thysel f unbegun. I know that of me, which thou knowest not of
thyself, oh, thou omnipotent. There is some unsuf fusing thing beyond thee, thou
clear spirit, to whom  all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness mechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see it. Oh, thou
foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast thy incommunicable
riddle, thy unpartici pated grief. Here again with haughty agony , I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be
welded with thee; defyingly I worship thee!”
“The boat! the boat!” cried Starbuck, “look at thy boat, old man!”
Ahab’ s harpoon, the one forged at Perth’ s fire, remained firmly lashed in its
conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat’ s bow; but the sea
that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off; and
from the keen steel barb there now came  a levelled flame of pale, forked fire. As
the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent’ s tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab
by the arm—“God, God is against thee, old man; forbear! ’tis an ill voyage! ill
begun, ill continued ; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make
a fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.”
Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the braces—
though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast mate’ s thought s
seemed theirs; they raised a half mutino us cry. But dashing the rattling lightning
links to the deck, and snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch
among them; swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a
rope’ s end. Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart
that he held, the men fell back in dismay , and Ahab again spoke:—
“All your oaths to hunt the White Wha le are as binding as mine; and heart,
soul, and body , lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye may know to what
tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out the last fear!” And with one
blast of his breath he extinguished the flame.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it so much the
more unsafe, becaus e so much the more a mark for thunderbolts; so at those last
words of Ahab’ s many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay . CHAPTER 120.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

“Strike nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, I’d sway them up now .”
“Sir!—in God’ s name!—sir?”
“Well.”
“The anchors are working, sir . Shall I get them inboard?”
“Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind rises, but it

"First take your leg off from
the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the rope; now listen. What’ s
the mighty difference between holding a mast’ s lightning-rod in the storm, and
standing close by a mast that hasn’ t got any lightning-rod at all in a storm? Don’ t you see, you timber -head, that no harm can come to the holder of the rod,
unless the mast is first struck? What are you talking about, then? Not one ship in
a hundred  carries rods, and Ahab,—aye , man, and all of us,—were in no more
danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten thousand ships now
sailing the seas. Why , you King-Post, you, I suppose you would have every man
in the world go about with a small lightning-rod running up the corner of his hat,
like a militia officer’s skewered feather , and trailing behind like his sash. Why
don’t ye be sensible,  Flask? it’s easy to be sensible; why don’t ye, then? any man
with half an eye can be sensible.”
“I don’ t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.”
“Yes, when a fellow ’s soaked through, it’s hard to be sensible, that’s a fact. And I am about drenched with this spray . Never mind; catch the turn there, and
pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were
never going to be used again. Tying these two anchors here, Flask, seems like
tying a man’ s hands  behind him. And what big generous hands they are, to be
sure. Thes e are your iron fists, hey? Wha t a hold they have, too! I wonder , Flask,
whether the world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an
uncommon long cable, though. There, hammer that knot down, and we’ve done . So; next to touching  land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory . I say, just
wring out my jacket  skirts, will ye?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Thank ye. They laugh at long-togs so, Flask ;
but seems to me, a long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way, serve  to carry off the water , d’ye see. Same
with cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more
monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and drive
down a beaver; so. Halloa! whew! there goes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord ,
Lord, that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly! This is a
nasty night, lad.”

https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 310/353motions, even though preventer tackles  had been attached to it—for they were
slack—because some play to the tiller was indispensable. In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast,
it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses, at intervals, go
round and round. It was thus with the Pequod’ s; at almost every shock the
helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they
revolved upon the cards; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold withou t
some sort of unwonted emotion. Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the
strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb—one engaged forward and the other
aft—the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails were cut adrift
from the spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like the feathers of an
albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm-tossed bird is
on the wing. The three correspon ding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a storm-
trysail was set furth er aft; so that the ship soon went through the water with
some precision again; and the course—for the present, East-south-east—which
he was to steer, if practicable, was once more given to the helmsman. For during
the violence of the gale, he had only steered according to its vicissitudes. But as
he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible, watching the
compass meanwhile, lo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round astern;
aye, the foul breeze became fair! Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of “Ho! the fair wind! oh-
ye-ho, cheerly men! ” the crew singing for joy, that so promising an event should
so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it. In compliance with the standing order of his commander—to report
immediately , and at any one of the twen ty-four hours, any decided change in the
affairs of the deck,—Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze—
however reluctantly and gloomily ,—than  he mechanically went below to apprise
Captain Ahab of the circumstance. Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a moment. The cabin  lamp—taking long swings this way and that—was burning fitfully ,
and castin g fitful shadows upon the old man’ s bolted door,—a thin one, with
fixed blinds inserted, in place of upper panels. The isolated subterraneousness of
the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there, though it was hooped
round by all the roar of the elements. The loaded muskets in the rack were
shiningly revealed, as they stood uprigh t against the forward bulkhead. Starbuck
was an honest, upright man; but out of Starbuck’ s heart, at that instant when he
saw the muskets, there strangely evolved an evil thought; but so blent with its
neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself. “He would have shot me once,” he murmured, “yes, there’ s the very musket
that he pointed at me;—that one with the studded stock; let me touch it—lift it. Strange, that I, who have handled so many deadly lances, strange, that I should
shake so now. Loade d? I must see. Aye, aye; and powder in the pan;—that’ s not
good. Best spill it?—wait. I’ll cure myself of this. I’ll hold the musket boldly
while I think.—I come to report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair for death
and doom,— that’s fair for Moby Dick. It’s a fair wind that’s only fair for that
accursed fish.—The very tube he pointed at me!—the very one; this one—I hold
it here; he would have killed me with the very thing I handle now.—A ye and he
would fain kill all his crew . Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any
gale? Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in these same perilous seas,
gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the error -abounding log? and6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

"Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes,
just there,—in there, he’s sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake
again. I can’t withstand thee, then, old man. Not reasoning; not remonstrance ;

own flat commands , this is all thou breathest. Aye, and say’st the men have
vow’d thy vow; say’st all of us are Ahabs. Great God forbid!—But is there no
other way? no lawful way?—Make him a prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this old man’ s living power from his own living hands? Only a
fool would  try it. Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and
hawsers; chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more
hideous than a caged tiger, then. I could  not endure the sight; could not possibly
fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would leave me on
the long intolerable voyage. What, then, remains? The land is hundreds of
leagues away, and locked Japan the nearest. I stand alone here upon an open sea,
with two oceans and a whole continent between me and law.—A ye, aye, ’tis so. —Is heave n a murderer when its lightn ing strikes a would-be murderer in his
bed, tinde ring sheets and skin togethe r?—And would I be a murderer , then,

musket’ s end against the door . “On this level, Ahab’ s hammock swings within; his head this way. A touch,
and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.—Oh Mary! Mary!—
boy! boy! boy!—But if I wake thee not to death, old man, who can tell to what
unsounded deeps Starbuck’ s body this day week may sink, with all the crew! Great God, where art Thou?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Shall I? shall I?—The wind has gone down and
shifted, sir; the fore and main topsails are reefed and set; she heads her course.”
“Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!”
Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man’ s
tormented sleep, as if Starbuck’ s voice had caused the long dumb dream to
speak. The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard’ s arm against the panel;
Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the door, he placed
the death-tube in its rack, and left the place. “He’ s too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and tell him. I must see to the deck here. Thou know’ st what to say .”
CHAPTER 124. The Needle. Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of mighty
bulk, and striving in the Pequod’ s gurgling track, pushed her on like giants’
palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded so, that sky and air
seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world boomed before the wind . Muffled in the full morning light, the invisible sun was only known by the
spread intensity of his place; where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 312/353Emblazonings, as of crowned Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over
everything. The sea was as a crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with
light and heat. Long maintaining an enchanted silence,  Ahab stood apart; and every time the
tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to eye the bright
sun’s rays produced  ahead; and when she profoundly settled by the stern, he
turned behind, and saw the sun’s rearward place, and how the same yellow rays
were blending with his undeviating wake. “Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot of the
sun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to ye! Yoke on the
further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!”
But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards the
helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading. “East-sou-east, sir ,” said the frightened steersman. “Thou liest!” smiting him with his clenched fist. “Heading East at this hour in
the morning, and the sun astern?”
Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then observed
by Ahab had unac countably escaped every one else; but its very blinding
palpableness must have been the cause. Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse of the
compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost seemed to
stagger . Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two compasses
pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West. But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew , the old man
with a rigid laugh exclaimed, “I have it! It has happened before.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Mr. Starbuck ,
last night’s thunder turned our compa sses—that’ s all. Thou hast before now
heard of such a thing, I take it.”
“Aye; but never before has it happen ed to me, sir,” said the pale mate,
gloomily . Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than one case
occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as developed in the
mariner ’s needle, is, as all know , essen tially one with the electricity beheld in
heaven; hence it is not to be much marvelled at, that such things should be. Instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down
some of the spars and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still
more fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before magnetic
steel was of no more use than an old wife’s knitting needle. But in either case,
the needle never again, of itself, recover s the original virtue thus marred or lost;
and if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate reaches all the others
that may be in the ship; even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson. Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed
compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took the
precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted,
shouted out his orders for the ship’ s course to be changed accordingly . The yards
were hard up; and once more the Pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the
opposing wind, for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her . Meanwhile, whatev er were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said nothing,
but quietly he issued  all requisite order s; while Stubb and Flask—who in some
small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings—likewise unmurmuringly
acquiesced. As for the men, though some of them lowly rumbled, their fear of
Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate. But as ever before, the pagan6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 313/353harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only
with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab’ s. For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But chancing to
slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper sight-tubes of the quadrant he
had the day before dashed to the deck. “Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun’s pilot! yesterday I wrecked thee,
and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But Ahab is lord
over the level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbu ck—a lance without a pole; a top-maul,
and the smallest of the sail-maker ’s needles. Quick!”
Accessory , perhaps, to the impulse dicta ting the thing he was now about to do,
were certa in prudential motives, whose object might have been to revive the
spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a matter so wondrous as that
of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old man well knew that to steer by
transpointed needles , though clumsily practicable, was not a thing to be passed
over by superstitious sailors, without some shudderings and evil portents. “Men,” said he, steadily turning upon the crew , as the mate handed him the
things he had demanded, “my men, the thunder turned old Ahab’ s needles; but
out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own, that will point as true as
any.”
Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as this was
said; and with fasci nated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow . But
Starbuck looked away . With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance,
and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade him hold it
upright, without its touching the deck. Then, with the maul, after repeatedly
smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he placed the blunted needle endwise on
the top of it, and less strongly hammered that, several times, the mate still
holding the rod as before. Then going through some small strange motions with
it—whether indispen sable to the magne tizing of the steel, or merely intended to
augment the awe of the crew , is uncertain—he called for linen thread; and
moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there, and
horizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of the compass-
cards. At first, the steel went round and round, quivering and vibrating at either
end; but at last it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently watching
for this result, steppe d frankly back from  the binnacle, and pointing his stretched
arm towards it, excla imed,—“Look ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the
level loadstone! The sun is East, and that compass swears it!”
One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could
persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk away . In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph , you then saw Ahab in all his fatal
pride. CHAPTER 125.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Log and Line. While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log and
line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance upon other
means of determining the vessel’ s place, some merchantmen, and many
whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave the log; though at6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

putting down upon the customary slate the course steered by the ship, as well as
the presumed average rate of progression every hour. It had been thus with the
Pequod. The wooden reel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just
beneath the railing of the after bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and
wind had warped it; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so
idly. But heedless of all this, his mood  seized Ahab, as he happened to glance
upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet scene, and he remembered how
his quadrant was no more, and recalled  his frantic oath about the level log and
line. The ship was sailing plungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots. “Forward, there! Heave the log!”
Two seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman. “Take the reel, one of ye, I’ll heave.”
They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship’ s lee side, where the deck,
with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into the creamy ,
sidelong-rushing sea. The Manxman took the reel, and holdin g it high up, by the projecting handle-
ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so stood with the
angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to him. Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns
to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old Manxman, who
was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to speak. “Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have spoiled it.”
“’Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee? Thou
seem’ st to hold. Or , truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it.”
“I hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey hairs of
mine ’tis not worth  while disputing, ’specially with a superior , who’ll ne’er
confess.”
“What’ s that? There now’ s a patched professor in Queen Nature’ s granite-
founded College; but methinks he’ s too subservient. Where wert thou born?”
“In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir .”
“Excellent! Thou’ st hit the world by that.”
“I know not, sir , but I was born there.”
“In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it’s good. Here’ s a man from
Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man; which
is sucked in—by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall butts all inquiring
heads at last.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
Up with it!,"Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"So.”
The log was heave d. The loose coils  rapidly straightened out in a long
dragging line astern, and then, instantly , the reel began to whirl. In turn,
jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing resistance of the
log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely . “Hold hard!”
Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the tugging log
was gone. “I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad sea
parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian; reel up,
Manxman. And look ye, let the carpent er make another log, and mend thou the
line. See to it.”

loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in, Tahitian! These lines6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

“Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip’s missing. Let’s see now if ye haven’ t fished him up here, fisherman. It drags hard; I guess
he’s holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul in no cowards here. Ho! there’ s his arm just breaking water . A hatchet! a hatchet! cut it off—we haul in
no cowards here. Captain Ahab! sir , sir! here’ s Pip, trying to get on board again.”
“Peace, thou crazy loon,” cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm. “Away
from the quarter -deck!”
“The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser ,” muttered Ahab, advancing. “Hands
off from that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was, boy? “Astern there, sir , astern! Lo! lo!”
“And who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of thy
eyes. Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve through! Who art thou, boy?”
“Bell-boy , sir; ship’ s-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip! Pip! One hundred
pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high—looks cowardly—quickest known
by that! Ding, dong, ding! Who’ s seen Pip the coward?”
“There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"look
down here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned him, ye creative
libertines. Here, boy; Ahab’ s cabin shall be Pip’s home henceforth, while Ahab
lives. Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy; thou art tied to me by cords woven
of my heart-strings. Come, let’ s down.”
“What’ s this? here’ s velvet shark-skin,” intently gazing at Ahab’ s hand, and
feeling it. “Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this, perhaps he had
ne’er been  lost! This seems to me, sir, as a man-rope; something that weak souls
may hold by. Oh, sir, let old Perth now come and rivet these two hands together ;
the black one with the white, for I will not let this go.”
“Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse horrors
than are here. Come , then, to my cabin.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Lo! ye believers in gods all goodness ,
and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man;
and man, though idiotic, and knowing not what he does, yet full of the sweet
things of love and gratitude. Come! I feel prouder leading thee by thy black
hand, than though I grasped an Emperor ’s!”
“There go two daft ones now,” muttere d the old Manxman. “One daft with
strength, the other daft with weakness. But here’ s the end of the rotten line—all
dripping, too. Mend it, eh? I think we had best have a new line altogether . I’ll
see Mr . Stubb about it.”
CHAPTER 126. The Life-Buoy . Steering now south-eastward by Ahab’ s levelled steel, and her progress solely
determined by Ahab’ s level log and line; the Pequod held on her path toward s
the Equat or. Making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters,
descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds ,
over waves monotonously mild; all these seemed the strange calm thing s
preluding some riotous and desperate scene.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 316/353At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the Equatorial
fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn, was sailing
by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch—then headed by Flask—was startled by a
cry so plaintively wild and unearthly —like half-articulated wailings of the
ghosts of all Herod’ s murdered Innoce nts—that one and all, they started from
their rever ies, and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all
transfixedly listening , like the carved Roman slave, while that wild cry remained
within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids,
and shuddered; but the pagan harpoon eers remained unappalled. Yet the grey
Manxman—the oldest mariner of all—declared that the wild thrilling sounds
that were heard, were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea. Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he
came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not unaccompanied
with hinte d dark meanings. He hollo wly laughed, and thus explained the
wonder . Those rocky islands the ship had passe d were the resort of great numbers of
seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or some dams that had lost
their cubs,  must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her, crying and
sobbing with their human sort of wail. But this only the more affected some of
them, because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals,
arising not only from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from the
human look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen peeringly
uprising from the water alongside. In the sea, under certain circumstances, seals
have more than once been mistaken for men. But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible
confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At sun-rise this
man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore; and whether it was
that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for sailors sometimes go aloft in a
transition state), whether it was thus with the man, there is now no telling; but,
be that as it may, he had not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard—a cry
and a rushing—and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and
looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea. The life-b uoy—a long slender cask—was dropped from the stern, where it
always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it, and the
sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it slowly filled, and
that parch ed wood also filled at its every pore; and the studded iron-bound cask
followed the sailor to the bottom, as if to yield him his pillow , though in sooth
but a hard one. And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the
White Whale, on the White Whale’ s own peculiar ground; that man was
swallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the time. Indeed ,
in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at least as a portent; for they
regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future, but as the fulfilment of
an evil already presaged. They declared that now they knew the reason of those
wild shrieks they had heard the night before.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"But again the old Manxman said
nay. The lost life-buoy was now to be replac ed; Starbuck was directed to see to it;
but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in the feverish
eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage, all hands were
impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end,
whatever that might prove to be; theref ore, they were going to leave the ship’ s
stern unprovided with a buoy , when by certain strange signs and inuendoe s
Queequeg hinted a hint concerning his cof fin.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

"“It will make a good enough one,” said Flask, “the carpenter here can arrange
it easily .”
“Bring it up; there’ s nothing else for it,” said Starbuck, after a melancholy
pause. “Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so—the coffin, I mean. Dost thou
hear me? Rig it.”
“And shall I nail down the lid, sir?” moving his hand as with a hammer . “Aye.”
“And shall I caulk the seams, sir?” moving his hand as with a caulking-iron. “Aye.”
“And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?” moving his hand as with
a pitch-pot. “Away!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

more.—Mr . Stubb, Mr . Flask, come forward with me.”
“He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he baulks.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Now I
don’t like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he wears it like a gentleman;
but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he won’ t put his head into it. Are all
my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now I’m ordered to make a life-
buoy of it. It’s like turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side
now. I don’t like this cobbling sort of business—I don’t like it at all; it’s
undignified; it’s not my place. Let tinkers’  brats do tinkerings; we are their
betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin, fair-and-square
mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at the beginning, and is at
the middle when midway , and comes to an end at the conclusion; not a cobbler ’s
job, that’s at an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end. It’s the old
woman’ s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all old
women have for tinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with
a bald-hea ded young  tinker once. And that’s the reason I never would work for
lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the Vineyard; they
might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let me see.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Nail down the lid; caulk the
seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with
the snap-spring over the ship’ s stern. Were ever such things done before with a
coffin? Some superstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging,
ere they would do the job. But I’m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don’t
budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing  about with a grave-yard tray! But neve r
mind. We workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as
coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not
for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless it be too confounded
cobbling, and then we stash it if we can. Hem!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

three feet long hang ing all round to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down, there’ll

“Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,
monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the next
day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those same coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a jack-of-all-trades.”
“But I do not mean anything, sir . I do as I do.”
“The gods  again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin? The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for
volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in hand. Dost thou
never?”
“Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I’m indifferent enough, sir, for that; but the reason
why the grave-digger made music must have been because there was none in his
spade, sir . But the caulking mallet is full of it. Hark to it.”
“Aye, and that’s because the lid there’ s a sounding-board; and what in all
things makes the sounding-board is this—there’ s naught beneath. And yet, a
coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same, Carpenter . Hast thou ever
helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate,
going in? “Faith, sir , I’ve——”

CHAPTER 128. The Pequod Meets
The Rachel. Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down upon
the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the time the Pequod
was making good speed through the water; but as the broad-winged windward
stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that
are burst, and all life fled from the smitten hull. “Bad news; she brings bad news,” muttered the old Manxman. But ere her
commander , who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he could
hopefully hail, Ahab’ s voice was heard. “Hast seen the White Whale?”
“Aye, yesterday . Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?”
Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question; and
would then have fain boarded the stranger , when the stranger captain himself ,
having stopped his vessel’ s way, was seen descending her side. A few keen pulls ,
and his boat-hook soon clinched the Pequod’ s main-chains, and he sprang to the
deck. Imm ediately he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew . But
no formal salutation was exchanged. “Where was he?—not killed!—not killed!” cried Ahab, closely advancing. “How was it?”
It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous, while three
of the stranger’s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales, which had led them
some four or five miles from the ship; and while they were yet in swift chase to
windward, the white hump and head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out
of the water , not very far to leeward;  whereupon, the fourth rigged boat—a
reserved one—had been instantly lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the
wind, this fourth boat—the swiftest keeled of all—seemed to have succeeded in
fastening—at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything abou t
it. In the distance he saw the diminishe d dotted boat; and then a swift gleam of
bubbling white wate r; and after that nothing more; whence it was concluded that
the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often
happens. There was some apprehension,  but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

three far to windw ard boats—ere going in quest of the fourth one in the
precisely opposite direction—the ship had not only been necessitated to leave
that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance
from it. But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded all sail—
stunsail on stunsail—after the missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a
beacon; and every other man aloft on the look-out. But though when she had
thus sailed  a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones
when last seen; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all
around her; and not finding anything, had again dashed on; again paused, and
lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued doing till daylight; yet not
the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen. The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his object
in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his own in the search;
by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart, on parallel lines, and so
sweeping a double horizon, as it were. “I will wager somet hing now,” whispered Stubb to Flask, “that some one in
that missing boat wore off that Captain’ s best coat; mayhap, his watch—he’ s so
cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two pious whale-ships cruising
after one missing whale-boat in the height of the whaling season? See, Flask,
only see how pale he looks—pale in the very buttons of his eyes—look—i t
wasn’ t the coat—it must have been the—”
“My boy, my own boy is among them. For God’ s sake—I beg, I conjure”—
here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had but icily received
his petition. “For eight-and-forty hours let me charter your ship—I will gladly
pay for it, and round ly pay for it—if there be no other way—for eight-and-forty
hours only—only that—you must, oh, you must, and you shall  do this thing.”
“His son!”  cried Stubb, “oh, it’s his son he’s lost! I take back the coat and
watch—what says Ahab? We must save that boy .”
“He’ s drowned with the rest on ’em, last night,” said the old Manx sailor
standing behind them; “I heard; all of ye heard their spirits.”
Now , as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel’ s the
more mela ncholy , was the circumstance, that not only was one of the Captain’ s
sons among the number of the missing boat’ s crew; but among the number of the
other boat’ s crews, at the same time, but on the other hand, separated from the
ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase, there had been still another son; as
that for a time, the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest
perplexity; which was only solved for him by his chief mate’ s instinctively
adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emer gencies, that is,
when placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to pick up the
majority first. But the captain, for some unknown constitutional reason, had
refrained from ment ioning all this, and not till forced to it by Ahab’ s iciness did
he allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose
father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer ’s paterna l
love, had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation
almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it unfrequently occur ,
that Nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them, for a
protracted three or four years’  voyage in some other ship than their own; so that
their first knowledge  of a whaleman’ s career shall be unenervated by any chance
display of a father ’s natural but untimely partiality , or undue apprehensiveness
and concern.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

Ahab still stood like an anvil, receivi ng every shock, but without the least
quivering of his own. “I will not go,” said the stranger , “till you say aye to me. Do to me as you
would have me do to you in the like case. For you too have a boy, Captain Ahab
—though but a child, and nestling safely at home now—a child of your old age
too—Y es, yes, you relent; I see it—run, run, men, now, and stand by to square in
the yards.”
“Avast,” cried Ahab—“touch not a rope-yarn”; then in a voice that
prolongingly moulded every word—“C aptain Gardiner , I will not do it. Even
now I lose time.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and may I forgive
myself, but I must go.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle watch, and in three
minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers: then brace forward
again, and let the ship sail as before.”
Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin, leaving the
strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so
earnest suit. But starting from his encha ntment, Gardiner silently hurried to the
side; more fell than stepped into his boat, and returned to his ship. Soon the two ships diver ged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel was in
view , she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot, however small,
on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung round; starboard and
larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat against a head sea; and again it
pushed her before it; while all the while, her masts and yards were thickly
clustered with men, as three tall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying
among the boughs. But by her still halting course and wind ing, woeful way, you plainly saw that
this ship that so wept with spray , still remained without comfort. She was
Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were not. CHAPTER 129.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Cabin. (Ahab moving to go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to follow .)
“Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The hour is coming
when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have thee by him. There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too curing to my malady . Like cures
like; and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most desired health. Do thou
abide below here, where they shall serve thee, as if thou wert the captain. Aye,
lad, thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair; another screw to it, thou must
be.”
“No, no, no! ye have not a whole body , sir; do ye but use poor me for your
one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so I remain a part of ye.”
“Oh! spite  of million villains, this make s me a bigot in the fadeless fidelity of
man!—and a black! and crazy!—but methinks like-cures-like applies to him too;
he grows so sane again.”

bones now show white, for all the blackness of his living skin. But I will never

CHAPTER 130. The Hat. And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a
preliminary cruise, Ahab,—all other whaling waters swept—seemed to have
chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely there; now, that
he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting
wound had been inflicted; now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very
day prece ding had actually encountered Moby Dick;—and now that all his
successive meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the
demoniac indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters, whether
sinning or sinned against; now it was that there lurked a something in the old
man’ s eyes, which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. As the
unsetting polar star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months’  night
sustains its piercing, steady , central gaze; so Ahab’ s purpose now fixedly
gleamed down upon the constant midn ight of the gloomy crew . It domineered
above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain to hide
beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf. In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor , forced or natural, vanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more strove to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed ground to finest dust, and6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 323/353powdered, for the time, in the clamped mortar of Ahab’ s iron soul. Like
machines, they dumbly moved about the deck, ever conscious that the old man’ s
despot eye was on them. But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when he
thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that even as
Ahab’ s eyes so awed the crew’ s, the inscrutable Parsee’ s glance awed his; or
somehow , at least, in some wild way, at times affected it. Such an added, gliding
strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now; such ceaseless shuddering s
shook him; that the men looked dubio us at him; half uncertain, as it seemed,
whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast
upon the deck by some unseen being’ s body . And that shadow was always
hovering there. For not by night, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been known
to slumber , or go below . He would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned ;
his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say—W e two watchmen never rest. Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck,
unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole, or exactly pacing
the planks between two undeviating limits,—the main-mast and the mizen; or
else they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle,—his living foot advanced upon
the deck, as if to step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however
motionless he stood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not
swung in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never
tell unerringly whether , for all this, his eyes were really closed at times; or
whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter , though he stood so in the
scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp gathered in
beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat. The clothes that the night had
wet, the next day’s sunshine dried upon him; and so, day after day, and night
after night; he went no more beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the
cabin that thing he sent for . He ate in the same  open air; that is, his two only meals,—breakfast and
dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly grew all
gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blow n over, which still grow idly on at naked
base, though perished in the upper verdure. But though his whole life was now
become one watch on deck; and though  the Parsee’ s mystic watch was without
intermission as his own; yet these two never seemed to speak—one man to the
other—unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it
necessary . Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly ,
and to the awe-stru ck crew , they seem ed pole-like asunder . If by day they
chanced to speak one word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned
the slighte st verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours, without a single
hail, they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by the
mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw
his forethrown shadow , in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned substance. And yet, somehow , did Ahab—in his own proper self, as daily , hourly , and
every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,—Ahab seemed an
independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both seemed yoked
together , and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean shade siding the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may , all rib and keel was solid Ahab. At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard from aft,
—“Man the mast-heads!”—and all through the day, till after sunset and after
twilight, the same voice every hour, at the striking of the helmsman’ s bell, was
heard—“What d’ye see?—sharp! sharp!”
But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the children-seeking
Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac old man seemed6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 324/353distrustful of his crew’ s fidelity; at least, of nearly all except the Pagan
harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether Stubb and Flask might not
willingly overlook the sight he sought. But if these suspicions were really his, he
sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them, however his actions might
seem to hint them. “I will have the first sight of the whale myself,”—he said. “Aye! Ahab must
have the doubloon! ” and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed
bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved block, to secure to the
main-mast head, he received the two ends of the downward-reeved rope; and
attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end, in order to fasten it
at the rail. This done, with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin,
he looked round upon his crew , sweep ing from one to the other; pausing his
glance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then
settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,—“T ake the rope, sir— I
give it into thy hands, Starbuck.” Then  arranging his person in the basket, he
gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the one who
secured the rope at last; and afterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand
clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and
miles,—ahead, astern, this side, and that,—within the wide expanded circle
commanded at so great a height. When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the
rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is hoisted up to
that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these circumstances, its fastened
end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the
special watch of it. Because in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose
various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is
seen of them at the deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every
few minutes cast down from the fasteni ngs, it would be but a natural fatality , if,
unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some
carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea. So Ahab’ s
proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange thing about them
seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who had ever ventured to
oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision—one
of those too, whos e faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt
somewhat;—it was strange, that this was the very man he should select for his
watchman; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person’ s
hands. Now , the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten minutes;
one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly incommodiously
close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these latitudes; one of these
birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably
swift circlings. Then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air; then
spiralized downwards, and went eddying again round his head. But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed not to
mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would  any one else have marked it much, it
being no uncommo n circumstance; only now almost the least heedful eye
seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight. “Your hat, your hat, sir!” suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who being
posted at the mizen -mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab, though somewha t
lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing them. But already the sable wing was before the old man’ s eyes; the long hooked
bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with his prize.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would be king of Rome. But
only by the replacin g of the cap was that omen accounted good. Ahab’ s hat was
never restored; the wild hawk flew on and on with it; far in advance of the prow:
and at last disappeared; while from the point of that disappearance, a minute
black spot was dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the sea. CHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets
The Delight. The intens e Pequod  sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the life-
buoy-cof fin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably misnamed the
Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were fixed upon her broad
beams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships, cross the quarter -deck at the
height of eight or nine feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled
boats. Upon the stranger ’s shears were beheld  the shattered, white ribs, and some
few splint ered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you now saw
through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled, half-unhinged, and
bleaching skeleton of a horse. “Hast seen the White Whale?”
“Look!” replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with his
trumpet he pointed to the wreck. “Hast killed him?”
“The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,” answered the other ,
sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose gathered sides
some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together . “Not forged!” and snatching Perth’ s levelled iron from the crotch, Ahab held
it out, exclaiming—“Look ye, Nantuck eter; here in this hand I hold his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these barbs; and I swear to
temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin, where the White Whale most
feels his accursed life!”
“Then God keep thee, old man—see’ st thou that”—pointing to the hammock
—“I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only yesterday; but were
dead ere night. Only that one I bury; the rest were buried before they died; you
sail upon their tomb.” Then turning to his crew—“Are ye ready there? place the
plank then on the rail, and lift the body; so, then—Oh! God”—advancing
towards the hammock with uplifted hands—“may the resurrection and the life
——”
“Brace forward! Up helm!” cried Ahab like lightning to his men. But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of
the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not so quick, indeed ,
but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their
ghostly baptism. As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy hanging
at the Pequod’ s stern came into conspicuous relief.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your taffrail to show
us your cof fin!”
CHAPTER 132. The Symphony .","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were hardly
separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was transparently
pure and soft, with a woman’ s look, and the robust and man-like sea heaved with
long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson’ s chest in his sleep. Hither , and thither , on high, glided the snow-white wings of small, unspeckled
birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air; but to and fro in the
deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed mighty leviathans, sword-fish ,
and sharks; and these were the strong, troubled, murderous thinkings of the
masculine sea. But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and
shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were, that
distinguished them. Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this
bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the girdling line of the
horizon, a soft and tremulous motion—most seen here at the equator—denoted
the fond, throbbing trust, the loving alarms, with which the poor bride gave her
bosom away . Tied up and twisted ; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm and
unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the ashes of ruin;
untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn; lifting his splintered
helmet of a brow to the fair girl’ s forehead of heaven. Oh, immortal infancy , and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged creatures
that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how oblivious were ye
of old Ahab’ s close-coiled woe! But so have I seen little Miriam and Martha,
laughing-eyed elves , heedlessly gambol around their old sire; sporting with the
circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt-out crater of his
brain. Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side and
watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the more and
the more that he strove to pierce the profundity . But the lovely aromas in that
enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a moment, the cankerous thing in his
soul. That glad, happy air, that winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him;
the step-mother world, so long cruel—forbidding—now threw affectionate arms
round his stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one,
that however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her heart to save and to
bless. From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea; nor did
all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop. Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side; and
he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of
the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to touch him, or be noticed by him,
he yet drew near to him, and stood there. Ahab turned.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

“Sir.”
“Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. On such a day
—very much such a sweetness as this—I struck my first whale—a boy-
harpooneer of eighteen! Forty—forty—forty years ago!—ago! Forty years of
continual whaling! forty years of privation, and peril, and storm-time! forty
years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land, for
forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of
those forty years I have not spent three ashore. When I think of this life I have
led; the desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a
Captain’ s exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from
the green country without—oh, weariness! heaviness! Guinea-coast slavery of
solitary command!— when I think of all this; only half-suspected, not so keenly
known to me before—and how for forty  years I have fed upon dry salted fare—
fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil!—when the poorest landsman has
had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken the world’ s fresh bread to my
mouldy crusts—away , whole oceans away , from that young girl-wife I wedded
past fifty, and sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my
marriage pillow—wife? wife?—rather a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I
widowed that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and then, the madness, the
frenzy , the boiling blood and the smoking brow , with which, for a thousand
lowerings old Ahab has furiously , foam ingly chased his prey—more a demon
than a man!—aye, aye! what a forty years’  fool—fool—old fool, has old Ahab
been! Why this strife of the chase? why weary , and palsy the arm at the oar, and
the iron, and the lance? how the riche r or better is Ahab now? Behold.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Oh,
Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should
have been snatched from under me? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me,
that I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes! But
do I look very old, so very, very old, Starbuck? I feel deadly faint, bowed, and
humped, as though I were Adam, staggering beneath the piled centuries since
Paradise. God!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck;
let me look into a human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than
to gaze upon God. By the green land;  by the bright hearth-stone! this is the
magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no; stay on
board, on board!— lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives chase to
Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"No, no! not with the far away home I
see in that eye!”
“Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all! why
should any one give chase to that hated fish! Away with me! let us fly these
deadly waters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are Starbuck’ s—wife and child
of his brotherly , sisterly, play-fellow youth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and
child of thy loving, longing, paternal old age! Away!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"let us away!—this instant
let me alter the course! How cheerily , how hilariously , O my Captain, would we
bowl on our way to see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some such
mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket.”
“They have, they have. I have seen them—some summer days in the morning. About this time—yes, it is his noon nap now—the boy vivaciously wakes; sits
up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of cannibal old me; how I am abroad
upon the deep, but will yet come back to dance him again.”
“’Tis my Mary , my Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every morning,
should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father ’s sail! Yes,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

the course, and let us away! See, see!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"the boy’s face from the window! the boy’s
hand on the hill!”
But Ahab’ s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and cast his
last, cindered apple to the soil. “What is it, what nameless, inscrutable , unearthly thing is it; what cozening,
hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor commands me; that
against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep pushing, and crowding, and
jamming myself on all the time; recklessly making me ready to do what in my
own proper , natural heart, I durst not so much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I,
God, or who, that lifts this arm? But if the great sun move not of himself; but is
as an errand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some
invisible power; how then can this one small heart beat; this one small brain
think thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does that living,
and not I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round in this world, like
yonder windlass, and Fate is the hands pike. And all the time, lo! that smiling
sky, and this unsounded sea! Look!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"see yon Albicore! who put it into him to
chase and fang that flying-fish? Where do murderers go, man! Who’ s to doom,
when the judge himself is dragged to the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a
mild looking sky; and the air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away meadow;
they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck,
and the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping? Aye, toil we
how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye, and rust amid
greenness; as last year’s scythes flung down, and left in the half-cut swaths—
Starbuck!”
But blanched to a corpse’ s hue with despair , the Mate had stolen away . Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at two
reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was motionlessly leaning over
the same rail. CHAPTER 133. The Chase—First
Day. That night , in the mid-watch, when the old man—as his wont at intervals—
stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went to his pivot-hole, he
suddenly thrust out his face fiercely , snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship’ s
dog will, in drawing nigh to some barba rous isle. He declared that a whale must
be near. Soon that peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the
living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner surprised
when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane, and then ascertaining
the precise  bearing of the odor as nearl y as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the
ship’ s course to be slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened. The acute  policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at
daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead ,
smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it, the
polished metallic-like marks of some swift tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid
stream. “Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 329/353Thundering with the butts of three clubb ed handspikes on the forecastle deck,
Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale
from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their
hands. “What d’ye see?” cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky . “Nothing, nothing sir!” was the sound hailing down in reply . “T’gallant sails!—stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!”
All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for swaying him to
the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither ,
when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and while peering ahead through the
horizontal vacancy between the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a
gull-like cry in the air. “There she blows!—there she blows! A hump like a
snow-hill! It is Moby Dick!”
Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look-
outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had
so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final perch, some feet above
the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the top-
gallant-mast, so that the Indian’ s head was almost on a level with Ahab’ s heel. From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of
the sea revealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout
into the air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had
so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans. “And did none of ye see it before?” cried Ahab, hailing the perched men all
around him. “I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I cried
out,” said Tashtego. “Not the same instant; not the same—no , the doubloon is mine, Fate reserved
the doubloon for me. I only; none of ye could have raised the White Whale first. There she blows!—there she blows!—there she blows! There again!—there
again!” he cried, in long-drawn, lingerin g, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual
prolongings of the whale’ s visible jets. “He’ s going to sound! In stunsails! Down
top-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember , stay on board,
and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So; steady , man, steady! There
go flukes! No, no; only black water! All ready the boats there? Stand by, stand
by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck; lower , lower ,—quick, quicker!” and he slid
through the air to the deck. “He is heading straight to leeward, sir,” cried Stubb, “right away from us;
cannot have seen the ship yet.”
“Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Hard down the helm!—brace up! Shiver
her!—shiver her!—So; well that! Boats, boats!”
Soon all the boats but Starbuck’ s were dropped; all the boat-sails set—all the
paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and Ahab heading
the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah’ s sunken eyes; a hideous motion
gnawed his mouth. Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea; but only
slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew still more
smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a noon-meadow , so
serenely it spread. At length the breath less hunter came so nigh his seemingly
unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzl ing hump was distinctly visible, sliding
along the sea as if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of
finest, fleecy , greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 330/353projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters ,
went the glistening white shadow from  his broad, milky forehead, a musica l
rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue water s
interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake; and on
either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. But these were broken
again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea,
alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staf f rising from the
painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected
from the white whal e’s back; and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls
hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched
and rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons. A gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested the
gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished Europa
clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely , leering eyes sideways intent upon the
maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness , rippling straight for the nuptial bower
in Crete; not Jove, not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified
White Whale as he so divinely swam. On each soft side— coincident with the parted swell, that but once leaving
him, then flowed so wide away—on each bright side, the whale shed off
enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who namelessly
transported and allured by all this serenity , had ventured to assail it; but had
fatally found that quietude but the vestu re of tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm,
oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all who for the first time eye thee, no matter how
many in that same way thou may’ st have bejuggled and destroyed before. And thus,  through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among waves
whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby Dick moved
on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submer ged trunk, entirely
hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw. But soon the fore part of him slowly
rose from  the water; for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high
arch, like Virginia’ s Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered fluke s
in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight. Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly
lingered over the agitated pool that he left. With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the three
boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick’ s reappearance. “An hour,” said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat’ s stern; and he gazed
beyond the whale’ s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing
vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed whirling
round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze now freshened; the
sea began to swell. “The birds!—the birds!” cried Tashtego. In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now all
flying towards Ahab ’s boat; and when within a few yards began fluttering over
the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous, expectant cries. Their
vision was keener than man’ s; Ahab could discover no sign in the sea. But
suddenly as he peere d down and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white
living spot no bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and
magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two
long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the
undiscoverable botto m. It was Moby Dick’ s open mouth and scrolled jaw; his
vast, shadowed bulk still half blending  with the blue of the sea. The glittering
mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble tomb; and giving6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 331/353one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this
tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him,
went forw ard to the bows, and seizing Perth’ s harpoon, commanded his crew to
grasp their oars and stand by to stern. Now , by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis, its bow,
by anticipation, was made to face the whale’ s head while yet under water . But as
if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that malicious intelligence
ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself, as it were, in an instant,
shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat. Through and throug h; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for an
instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a biting shark ,
slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth, so that the long,
narrow , scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air, and one of the teeth
caught in a row-lock . The bluish pearl-w hite of the inside of the jaw was within
six inches of Ahab’ s head, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the
White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With
unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the tiger-yellow
crew were tumbling over each other ’s heads to gain the uttermost stern. And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the whale
dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his body being
submer ged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from the bows, for the
bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while the other boats
involuntarily paused, as before a quick  crisis impossible to withstand, then it
was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe,
which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with
all this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to
wrench it from its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him;
the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an
enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in twain, and locked
themselves fast again in the sea, midway  between the two floating wrecks. These
floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging to
the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across. At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first to
perceive the whale’ s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a movement that
loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had made one final effort
to push the boat out of the bite. But only slipping further into the whale’ s mouth,
and tilting over sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the
jaw; spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon
the sea. Ripplingly withdraw ing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little distance,
vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows; and at the
same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body; so that when his vast
wrinkled forehead rose—some twenty or more feet out of the water—the now
rising swells, with all their confluen t waves, dazzlingly broke against it;
vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air.* So, in a gale,
the but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone,
triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud. *This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its designation
(pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down poise of
the whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling, previously described. By this
motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever object s
may be encircling him.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 332/353But soon resuming his horizontal attitu de, Moby Dick swam swiftly round
and round the wreck ed crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake,
as if lashin g himself up to still another and more deadly assault. The sight of the
splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries
cast befor e Antiochus’ s elephants in the book of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab
half smothered in the foam of the whale’ s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple
to swim,—though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a
whirlpool as that; helpless Ahab’ s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the
least chance shock might burst. From the boat’ s fragmentary stern, Fedallah
incuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew , at the other drifting end,
could not succor him; more than enoug h was it for them to look to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale’ s aspect, and so planetarily
swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he seemed horizontally swooping
upon them . And though the other boats , unharmed, still hovered hard by; still
they dared not pull into the eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the
instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that case
could they themselv es hope to escape. With straining eyes, then, they remained
on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had now become the old
man’ s head. Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship’ s mast
heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene; and was now
so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!—“Sail on the”—but that moment a
breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the time. But strugg ling out of it again, and chancing to rise on a towering crest, he
shouted,—“Sail on the whale!—Drive him of f!”
The Pequod’ s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle, she
effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly swam off, the
boats flew to the rescue. Dragged into Stubb’ s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white brine
caking in his wrinkl es; the long tension of Ahab’ s bodily strength did crack, and
helplessly he yielded to his body’ s doom: for a time, lying all crushed in the
bottom of Stubb’ s boat, like one trodde n under foot of herds of elephants. Far
inland, nameless wails came from him, as desolate sounds from out ravines. But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more
abbreviate it. In an instant’ s compass, great hearts sometimes condense to one
deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler
men’ s whole lives. And so, such hearts,  though summary in each one suffering;
still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly
made up of instantaneous intensities; for even in their pointless centres, those
noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls. “The harpoon,” said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on one
bended arm—“is it safe?”
“Aye, sir , for it was not darted; this is it,” said Stubb, showing it. “Lay it before me;—any missing men?”
“One, two, three, four , five;—there were five oars, sir , and here are five men.”
“That’ s good.—Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
there!,"Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!—Hands off from me! The eterna l
sap runs up in Ahab’ s bones again! Set the sail; out oars; the helm!”
It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew , being picked up by
another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is thus continued with
what is called doubl e-banked oars. It was thus now. But the added power of the
boat did not equal the added power of the whale, for he seemed to have treble-6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 333/353banked his every fin; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed, that if
now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an
indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless  one; nor could any crew endure for so
long a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing barely
tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself, then, as it sometime s
happens, offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the
chase. Accordingly , the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to
their cranes—the two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured
by her—and then hoisting everything to her side, and stacking her canvas high
up, and sideways outstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings
of an albatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At
the well known, methodic intervals, the whale’ s glittering spout was regularly
announced from the manned mast-heads ; and when he would be reported as just
gone down , Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the deck, binnacle-watch
in hand, so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired, his voice was
heard.—“Whose is the doubloon now? D’ye see him?” and if the reply was, No,
sir! straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch. In this way the day
wore on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks. As he was thus walk ing, uttering no sound, except to hail the men aloft, or to
bid them hoist a sail still higher , or to spread one to a still greater breadth—thus
to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat, at every turn he passed his own
wrecked boat, which had been droppe d upon the quarter -deck, and lay there
reversed; broken bow to shattered stern. At last he paused before it; and as in an
already over-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so
over the old man’ s face there now stole some such added gloom as this. Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps inten ding, not vainly , though, to evince his
own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in his Captain’ s mind,
he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed—“The thistle the ass refused; it
pricked his mouth too keenly , sir; ha! ha!”
“What soulless thing  is this that laughs before a wreck?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Man, man! did I not
know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could swear thou wert a
poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck.”
“Aye, sir,” said Starbuck drawing near, “’tis a solemn sight; an omen, and an
ill one.”
“Omen? omen?—th e dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to man,
they will honorably speak outright; not shake their heads, and give an old wives’
darkling hint.—Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles of one thing; Starbuck is
Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck;  and ye two are all mankind; and Ahab
stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth, nor gods nor men his
neighbors! Cold, cold—I shiver!—How  now?","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
Aloft there!,"Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"D’ye see him? Sing
out for every spout, though he spout ten times a second!”
The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling. Soon,
it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset. “Can’ t see the spout now , sir;—too dark”—cried a voice from the air . “How heading when last seen?”
“As before, sir ,—straight to leeward.”
“Good! he will travel slower now ’tis night. Down royals and top-gallant stun-
sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before morning; he’s making a
passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm there! keep her full before the
wind!—Aloft!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"come down!—Mr . Stubb, send a fresh hand to the fore-mast
head, and see it manned till morning.”—Then advancing towards the doubloon
in the main-mast—“Men, this gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 334/353here till the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him,
upon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that man’ s; and if on that day I shall
again raise  him, then, ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye! Away
now!—the deck is thine, sir!”
And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and slouching
his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals rousing himself to see
how the night wore on. CHAPTER 134. The Chase—
Second Day . At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh. “D’ye see him?” cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to
spread. “See nothing, sir .”
“Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought for;—the
top-gallant sails!—a ye, they should have been kept on her all night. But no
matter—’ tis but resting for the rush.”
Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale,
continued through day into night, and through night into day, is a thing by no
means unprecedented in the South sea fishery . For such is the wonderful skill,
prescience of experience, and invincib le confidence acquired by some great
natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders; that from the simple
observation of a whale when last descried, they will, under certain given
circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will
continue to swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of
progression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when
about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which
he desires  shortly to return to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot
stands by his comp ass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at presen t
visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland ,
eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with the whale ;
for after being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours of daylight,
then, when night obscures the fish, the creature’ s future wake through the
darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter , as the
pilot’ s coast is to him. So that to this hunter ’s wondrous skill, the proverbia l
evanescence of a thing writ in water , a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh
as reliable as the steadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern
railway is so famil iarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their
hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby’ s pulse; and lightly say of it,
the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot, at such or such an
hour; even so, almo st, there are occasi ons when these Nantucketers time that
other Leviathan of the deep, according to the observed humor of his speed; and
say to themselves, so many hours hence  this whale will have gone two hundred
miles, will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to
render this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the sea must be
the whaleman’ s allies; for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound
mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 335/353quarter from his port? Inferable from  these statements, are many collatera l
subtile matters touching the chase of whales. The ship tore on; leaving such a furro w in the sea as when a cannon-ball,
missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level field. “By salt and hemp!”  cried Stubb, “but this swift motion of the deck creeps up
one’s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two brave fellows!—Ha ,
ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise, on the sea,—for by live-
oaks! my spine’ s a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait that leaves no dust behind!”
“There she blows—she blows!—she blows!—right ahead!” was now the
mast-head cry . “Aye, aye!” cried Stubb, “I knew it—ye  can’t escape—blow on and split your
spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow your trump—blister
your lungs !—Ahab will dam off your blood, as a miller shuts his water gate upon
the stream!”
And Stubb  did but speak out for well nigh all that crew . The frenzies of the
chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine worked anew . Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before; these
were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab, but they
were broken up, and on all sides routed, as timid prairie hares that scatter before
the bounding bison. The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the
stirring perils of the previous day; the rack of the past night’ s suspense; the
fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging
towards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled along. The
wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms
invisible as irresistib le; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so
enslaved them to the race. They were one man, not thirty . For as the one ship that held them all; though
it was put together of all contrasting things—oak, and maple, and pine wood ;
iron, and pitch, and hemp—yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete
hull, whic h shot on its way, both balanc ed and directed by the long central keel;
even so, all the individualities of the crew , this man’ s valor , that man’ s fear; guilt
and guiltiness, all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to
that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to. The riggi ng lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were
outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one hand,
some reached forth the other with impa tient wavings; others, shading their eyes
from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking yards; all the spars in full
bearing of mortals,  ready and ripe for their fate. Ah!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"how they still strove
through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them! “Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?” cried Ahab, when, after the
lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard. “Sway me up,
men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that way, and then
disappears.”
It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some other
thing for the whale- spout, as the event itself soon proved; for hardly had Ahab
reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck, when he
struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the air vibrate as with the
combined dischar ges of rifles. The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs
was heard , as—muc h nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet, less
than a mile ahead—Moby Dick bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and
indolent spoutings; not by the peaceable  gush of that mystic fountain in his head,
did the White Wha le now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrou s6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 336/353phenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest
depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air,
and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of
seven miles and more. In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes off,
seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of defiance. “There she breaches! there she breaches!” was the cry, as in his immeasurable
bravadoes the White Whale tossed hims elf salmon-like to Heaven. So suddenly
seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved against the still bluer margin of the
sky, the spray that he raised, for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like
a glacier; and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first
sparkling intensity , to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale. “Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby  Dick!” cried Ahab, “thy hour and thy
harpoon are at hand !—Down! down all of ye, but one man at the fore. The
boats!—stand by!”
Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like shooting
stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and halyards; while Ahab, less
dartingly , but still rapidly was dropped from his perch. “Lower away,” he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat—a spare one,
rigged the afternoon previous. “Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine—keep away from
the boats, but keep near them. Lower , all!”
As if to strike a quick terror into them,  by this time being the first assailant
himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the three crews . Ahab’ s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told them he would take the
whale head-and-he ad,—that is, pull straight up to his forehead,—a not
uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit, such a course excludes the
coming onset from the whale’ s sidelong vision. But ere that close limit was
gained, and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship’ s three masts to his
eye; the White Wha le churning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant
as it were , rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered
appalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every
boat, seem ed only intent on annihilati ng each separate plank of which those
boats were made. But skilfully manœuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained
chargers in the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but by a
plank’ s breadth; while all the time, Ahab’ s unearthly slogan tore every other cry
but his to shreds. But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed and
recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast
to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves, warped the devoted boats
towards the planted  irons in him; though now for a moment the whale drew
aside a little, as if to rally for a more tremendous charge. Seizing that
opportunity , Ahab first paid out more line: and then was rapidly hauling and
jerking in upon it again—hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls—
when lo!—a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks! Caught and twisted—corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons
and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing and dripping
up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab’ s boat. Only one thing could be done . Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached within—through—and then, without
—the rays of steel; dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the
bowsman, and then, twice sundering the rope near the chocks—dropped the
intercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the
White Whale made  a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other
lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling
maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced
round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch. While the two crew s were yet circling  in the waters, reaching out after the
revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while aslope little Flask
bobbed up and down  like an empty vial, twitching his legs upwards to escape the
dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle
him up; and while the old man’ s line—n ow parting—admitted of his pulling into
the creamy pool to rescue whom he could;—in that wild simultaneousness of a
thousand concreted perils,—Ahab’ s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up
towards Heaven by invisible wires,—a s, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly
from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom, and
sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell again—gunwale downwards
—and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it, like seals from a sea-side
cave. The first uprising momentum of the whale—modifying its direction as he
struck the surface—involuntarily launch ed him along it, to a little distance from
the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his back to it, he now lay for
a moment slowly feeling with his flukes  from side to side; and whenever a stray
oar, bit of plank, the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail
swiftly drew back, and came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied
that his work for that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the
ocean, and trailing after him the intertan gled lines, continued his leeward way at
a traveller ’s methodic pace. As before , the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again came
bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the floating
mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and safely landed
them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and ankles; livid
contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable intricacies of rope;
shattered oars and planks; all these were there; but no fatal or even serious ill
seemed to have befallen any one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was
now found grimly clinging to his boat’ s broken half, which afforded a
comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day’ s mishap. But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as
instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of Starbuck ,
who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory leg had been
snapped of f, leaving but one short sharp splinter . “Aye, aye, Starbuck, ’tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he will;
and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.”
“The ferru le has not stood, sir,” said the carpenter , now coming up; “I put
good work into that leg.”
“But no bones broken, sir , I hope,” said Stubb with true concern. “Aye! and all splin tered to pieces, Stubb!—d’ye see it.—But even with a
broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of mine one
jot more me, than this dead one that’s lost. Nor white whale, nor man, nor fiend,
can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being. Can
any lead touch yonder floor , any mast scrape yonder roof?—Aloft there! which
way?”
“Dead to leeward, sir .”
“Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of the spare
boats and rig them—Mr . Starbuck away , and muster the boat’ s crews.”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

“Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Accursed fate! that the
unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!”
“Sir?”
“My body , man, not thee. Give me something for a cane—there, that shivered
lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I have not seen him yet. By heaven it
cannot be!—missing?—quick! call them all.”
The old man’ s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company , the
Parsee was not there. “The Parsee!” cried Stubb—“he must have been caught in——”
“The black vomit wrench thee!—run all of ye above, alow , cabin, forecastle—
find him—not gone—not gone!”
But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was nowhere
to be found. “Aye, sir,” said Stubb—“caught among the tangles of your line—I thought I
saw him dragging under .”
“My line! my line? Gone?—gone ? What means that little word?—What death-
knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry . The harpoon, too! —toss over the litter there,—d’ye see it?—the forged iron, men, the white
whale’ s—no, no, no,—blistered fool! this hand did dart it!—’ tis in the fish!—
Aloft there! Keep him nailed—Quick!—all hands to the rigging of the boats—
collect the oars—ha rpooneers! the irons, the irons!—hoist the royals higher—a
pull on all the sheets!—helm there! steady , steady for your life! I’ll ten times
girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight through it, but I’ll slay him
yet!”
“Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,” cried Starbuck; “never ,
never wilt thou capture him, old man—In Jesus’  name no more of this, that’s
worse than devil’ s madness. Two days chased; twice stove to splinters; thy very
leg once more snatc hed from under thee; thy evil shadow gone—all good angels
mobbing thee with warnings:—what more wouldst thou have?—Shall we keep
chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man? Shall we be dragged by
him to the bottom of the sea? Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world? Oh, oh,—Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more!”
“Starbuck, of late I’ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that hour we
both saw—thou know’ st what, in one another ’s eyes. But in this matter of the
whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this hand—a lipless ,
unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This whole act’s immutably
decreed. ’Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates’  lieutenant; I act under orders. Look thou, underling! that
thou obeyest mine.—Stand round me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the
stump; leaning on a shivered lance; propped up on a lonely foot. ’Tis Ahab—hi s
body’ s part; but Ahab’ s soul’ s a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I
feel strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale; and I
may look so. But ere I break, ye’ll hear me crack; and till ye hear that, know that
Ahab’ s hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe ye, men, in the things called
omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry enco re! For ere they drown, drowning things
will twice rise to the surface; then rise again, to sink for evermore. So with
Moby Dick—two days he’s floated—tomorrow will be the third. Aye, men, he’ll
rise once more,—but only to spout his last! D’ye feel brave men, brave?”
“As fearless fire,” cried Stubb.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 339/353“And as mechanica l,” muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he
muttered on: “The things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same to
Starbuck there, conc erning my broken boat.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Oh! how valiantly I seek to drive
out of others’  hearts what’ s clinched so fast in mine!—The Parsee—the Parsee! —gone, gone? and he was to go before:—but still was to be seen again ere I
could perish—How’ s that?—There’ s a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers
backed by the ghosts of the whole line of judges:—like a hawk’ s beak it pecks
my brain. I’ll, I’ll solve it, though!”
When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward. So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on the
previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the grindstone was
heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and
careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weapons for the
morrow . Meantime,  of the broken keel of Ahab’ s wrecked craft the carpenter
made him another leg; while still as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood
fixed within his scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward
on its dial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun. CHAPTER 135.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The Chase.—
Third Day . The morning of the third day dawned  fair and fresh, and once more the
solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the dayligh t
look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar . “D’ye see him?” cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight. “In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that’s all. Helm there;
steady , as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day again! were it a
new-made world, and made for a summer -house to the angels, and this morning
the first of its throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that
world. Here’s food for thought, had Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks ;
he only feels, feels, feels; that’s tingling enough for mortal man! to think’ s
audacity . God only has that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a
coolness and a calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too
much for that. And yet, I’ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm—frozen
calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents turned to ice,
and shiver  it. And still this hair is growing now; this moment growing, and heat
must breed it; but no, it’s like that sort of common grass that will grow
anywhere, between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How
the wild winds blow  it; they whip it abou t me as the torn shreds of split sails lash
the tossed  ship they cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this
through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them ,
and now comes blow ing hither as innoc ent as fleeces. Out upon it!—it’ s tainted. Were I the wind, I’d blow no more on such a wicked, miserable world. I’d crawl
somewhere to a cave, and slink there. And yet, ’tis a noble and heroic thing, the
wind! who ever conquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow . Run tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that strikes stark
naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow . Even Ahab is a braver
thing—a nobler thing than that. Would now the wind but had a body; but all the6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

but only bodiless as objects, not as agents. There’ s a most special, a most
cunning, oh, a most malicious difference !","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"And yet, I say again, and swear it now,
that there’ s something all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm Trade
Winds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in strong and
steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark, however the baser
currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the land
swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go at last. And by the eternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on; these Trades, or
something like them—something so unchangeable, and full as strong, blow my
keeled soul along! To it!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"

about!,"Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Come down, all of ye, but the regular look outs! Man the braces!”
Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod’ s
quarter , so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced ship sailed
hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake. “Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw,” murmured Starbuck to
himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. “God keep us, but
already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside wet my flesh. I
misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!”
“Stand by to sway me up!” cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket. “We
should meet him soon.”
“Aye, aye, sir,” and straightway Starbuck did Ahab’ s bidding, and once more
Ahab swung on high. A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held long
breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the weather bow,
Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the three mast-heads three
shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it. “Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck there! —brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind’s eye. He’s too far off to lower yet,
Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that helmsman with a top-maul! So,
so; he travels fast, and I must down.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"But let me have one more good round look
aloft here at the sea; there’ s time for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so
young; aye, and not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-
hills of Nantucket! The same!—the same!—the same to Noah as to me. There’ s
a soft shower to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They must lead somewhere
—to something else than common land, more palmy than the palms. Leeward ! the white whale goes that way; look to windward, then; the better if the bittere r

mosses in these warped cracks. No such green weather stains on Ahab’ s head! There’ s the differen ce now between man’s old age and matter ’s. But aye, old
mast, we both grow old together; soun d in our hulls, though, are we not, my
ship? Aye, minus a leg, that’s all. By heaven this dead wood has the better of my
live flesh every way. I can’t compare with it; and I’ve known some ships made

again? But where? Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend
those endless stairs? and all night I’ve been sailing from him, wherever he did6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good-bye, mast-head—keep a good
eye upon the whale, the while I’m gone. We’ll talk to-morrow , nay, to-night ,
when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and tail.”
He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered through
the cloven blue air to the deck. In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop’ s stern,
Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the mate,—who
held one of the tackle-ropes on deck—and bade him pause. “Starbuck!”
“Sir?”
“For the third time my soul’ s ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck.”
“Aye, sir , thou wilt have it so.”
“Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing, Starbuck!”
“Truth, sir: saddest truth.”
“Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the flood;—
and I feel now like a billow that’s all one crested comb, Starbuck. I am old;—
shake hands with me, man.”
Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck’ s tears the glue. “Oh, my captain, my captain!—noble heart—go not—go not!—see, it’s a
brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!”
“Lower away!”—cr ied Ahab, tossing the mate’ s arm from him. “Stand by the
crew!”
In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern. “The shark s! the sharks!” cried a voice from the low cabin-window there; “O
master , my master , come back!”
But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the boat
leaped on. Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when
numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull,
maliciously snapped  at the blades of the oars, every time they dipped in the
water; and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites. It is a thing not
uncommonly happen ing to the whale-bo ats in those swarming seas; the sharks at
times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover
over the banners of marching regiments in the east. But these were the first
sharks that had been  observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been
first descried; and whether it was that Ahab’ s crew were all such tiger-yellow
barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks—a
matter sometimes well known to affect them,—however it was, they seemed to
follow that one boat without molesting the others. “Heart of wrought steel!” murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and
following with his eyes the receding boat—“canst thou yet ring boldly to that
sight?—lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and followed by them, open-
mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third day?—For when three days flow
together in one continuous intense pursuit; be sure the first is the morning, the
second the noon, and the third the evening and the end of that thing—be that end
what it may. Oh!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"my God! what is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so
deadly calm, yet expectant,—fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things swim
before me, as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is somehow grown
dim. Mary , girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I seem to see but thy6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

sweep between—Is my journey’ s end coming? My legs feel faint; like his who
has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,—be ats it yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!—stave
it off—move, move! speak aloud!—Ma st-head there! See ye my boy’s hand on
the hill?—Crazed;—aloft there!—keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:—mark

vane”—pointing to the red flag flying at the main-truck—“Ha! he soars away
with it!—W here’ s the old man now? see’st thou that sight, oh Ahab!—shudder ,
shudder!”
The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads—a
downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but intending to
be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a little sideways from the
vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence, as the head-
beat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow . “Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye wave s!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"to their uttermost heads drive them
in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and no hearse can be mine:
—and hemp only can kill me! Ha!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"ha!”
Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then
quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submer ged berg of ice, swiftly
rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a subterraneous hum; and
then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with trailing ropes, and harpoons, and
lances, a vast form shot lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a
thin drooping veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and
then fell swamping back into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters
flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of
flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble
trunk of the whale. “Give way!” cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to the
attack; but maddened by yesterday’ s fresh irons that corroded in him, Moby
Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven. The
wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead, beneath
the transparent skin, looked knitted together; as head on, he came churning his
tail among the boats; and once more flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and
lances from the two mates’  boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of
their bows, but leaving Ahab’ s almost without a scar . While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the
whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he shot
by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round and round to
the fish’s back; pinio ned in the turns upon turns in which, during the past night ,
the whale had reeled  the involutions of the lines around him, the half torn body
of the Parsee was seen; his sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes
turned full upon old Ahab. The harpoon dropped from his hand. “Befooled, befooled!”—drawing in a long lean breath—“A ye, Parsee! I see
thee again .—A ye, and thou goest befor e; and this, this then is the hearse that
thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word. Where is the
second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those boats are useless now; repair
them if ye can in time, and return to me; if not, Ahab is enough to die—Down,
men! the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I
harpoon. Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.—
Where’ s the whale? gone down again?”6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 343/353But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse
he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage
in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily swimming forward ;
and had almost passed the ship,—which thus far had been sailing in the contrary
direction to him, though for the present her headway had been stopped. He
seemed swimming with his utmost velocity , and now only intent upon pursuing
his own straight path in the sea. “Oh! Ahab,” cried Starbuck, “not too late is it, even now, the third day, to
desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that madly seekest him!”
Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to
leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding by the
vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck’ s face as he leaned over the
rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and follow him, not too swiftly , at a
judicious interval. Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo ,
eagerly mounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the
two staved  boats which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at
work in repairing them. One after the other , through the port-holes, as he sped,
he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying themselves on deck
among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all this; as he heard the
hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his
heart. But he rallied. And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the
main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashteg o, who had just gained that perch, to
descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the
mast. Whether fagged by the three days’  running chase, and the resistance to his
swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some latent
deceitfulness and malice in him: which ever was true, the White Whale’ s way
now bega n to abate, as it seemed, from  the boat so rapidly nearing him once
more; though indeed the whale’ s last start had not been so long a one as before . And still as Ahab glided over the waves  the unpitying sharks accompanied him;
and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars,
that the blades became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea,
at almost every dip. “Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull on! ’tis
the better rest, the shark’ s jaw than the yielding water .”
“But at every bite, sir , the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!”
“They will last long enough! pull on!—But who can tell”—he muttered
—“whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on Ahab?—But pull on! Aye, all alive, now—we near him.","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"The helm! take the helm! let me pass,”—and
so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying
boat. At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with the
White Whale’ s flank, he seemed stran gely oblivious of its advance—as the
whale sometimes will—and Ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist,
which, thrown off from the whale’ s spout, curled round his great, Monadnock
hump; he was even thus close to him; when, with body arched back, and both
arms lengthwise high-lifted to the poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far
fiercer curse into the hated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as
if sucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his
nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly canted
the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which
he then clung, Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea. As it was,6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 344/353three of the oarsmen—who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart, and
were there fore unpre pared for its effects —these were flung out; but so fell, that,
in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a
combing wave, hurled themselves bodily  inboard again; the third man helplessly
dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming. Almost simultaneously , with a mighty volition of ungraduated, instantaneous
swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering sea. But when Ahab
cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line, and hold it so; and
commanded the crew to turn round on their seats, and tow the boat up to the
mark; the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug, it snapped
in the empty air! “What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!—’ tis whole again; oars! oars! Burst
in upon him!”
Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled
round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution, catching sight
of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing in it the source of all his
persecutions; bethinking it—it may be—a larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he
bore down  upon its advancing prow , smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of
foam. Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. “I grow blind; hands! stretch
out before me that I may yet grope my way . Is’t night?”
“The whale! The ship!” cried the cringing oarsmen. “Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for ever too
late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I see: the ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?”
But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledge-hammering
seas, the before whale-smitten bow-end s of two planks burst through, and in an
instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves; its
half-wading, splashing crew , trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring
water . Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego’ s mast-head hammer
remained suspended  in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as with a
plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own forward-flowing
heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the bowsprit beneath, caught
sight of the down-coming monster just as soon as he. “The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of air,
now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a woman’ s fainting
fit. Up helm, I say—ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is this the end of all my bursting
prayers? all my life-long fidelities? Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady . Nay, nay! Up helm  again! He turns to meet us! Oh, his
unappeasable brow drives on towards one, whose duty tells him he canno t
depart. My God, stand by me now!”
“Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now help
Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning whale! Who ever
helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb’ s own unwinking eye? And now
poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft; would it were stuffed
with brush wood! I grin at thee, thou grinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, and
stars! I call ye assas sins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost. For all
that, I would yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh!","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"oh,
oh! thou grinning whale, but there’ll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye not,
O Ahab! For me, off shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in his drawers! A most6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

"cherries! Oh, Flask,
for one red cherry ere we die!”
“Cherries? I only wish that we were where they grow . Oh, Stubb, I hope my
poor mother ’s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will now come to
her, for the voyage is up.”
From the ship’ s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers, bits
of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their hands, just as they
had darted from their various employments; all their enchanted eyes intent upon
the whale, which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head ,
sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite
of all that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead smote
the ship’ s starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell flat upon their
faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their
bull-like necks. Through the breach, they heard the waters pour, as mountain
torrents down a flume. “The ship! The hearse!—the second hearse!” cried Ahab from the boat; “its
wood could only be American!”
Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its keel; but
turning under water , swiftly shot to the surface again, far off the other bow, but
within a few yards of Ahab’ s boat, where, for a time, he lay quiescent. “I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy hammer .","Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville.pdf"
"Oh! ye three unsurr endered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel; and only god-
bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and Pole-pointed prow ,—death-
glorious ship! must ye then perish, and without me? Am I cut off from the last
fond pride of mean est shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all
your furth est bounds , pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone life,
and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I roll, thou all-
destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell’s
heart I stab at thee; for hate’ s sake I spit my last breath at thee. Sink all coffins
and all hearses to one common pool! and since neither can be mine, let me then
tow to pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! Thus , I give up the spear!”
The harpo on was darted; the stricken  whale flew forward; with igniting
velocity the line ran through the grooves;—ran foul. Ahab stooped to clear it; he
did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the neck, and voicelessly as
Turkish mutes bows tring their victim, he was shot out of the boat, ere the crew
knew he was gone. Next instant, the heavy eye-splice in the rope’ s final end flew
out of the stark-empty tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea,
disappeared in its depths. For an instant, the tranced boat’ s crew  stood still; then turned. “The ship? Great God, where is the ship?” Soon they through dim, bewildering mediums
saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata Morgana; only the
uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by infatuation, or fidelity , or fate, to
their once  lofty perches, the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking
lookouts on the sea. And now, concentr ic circles seized the lone boat itself, and
all its crew , and each floating oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning, animate
and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the
Pequod out of sight. But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken
head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701-images.html 346/353visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag, which calmly undulated,
with ironi cal coincid ings, over the destr oying billows they almost touched;—at
that instant, a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open
air, in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-
hawk that tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natura l
home among the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there ;
this bird now chance d to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hamme r
and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill, the submer ged
savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen there; and so the bird
of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards, and
his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his ship,
which, like Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of
heaven along with her , and helmeted herself with it. Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen white
surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the great shroud of the
sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago. Epilogue
“AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO
TELL THEE” Job. The drama’ s done. Why then here does any one step forth?—Because one did
survive the wreck. It so chanced, that after the Parsee’ s disappearance, I was he whom the Fates
ordained to take the place of Ahab’ s bowsman, when that bowsman assumed the
vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three men were tossed from
out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So, floating on the margin of the
ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship
reached me, I was then, but slowly , drawn towards the closing vortex. When I
reached it, it had subsided to a creamy  pool. Round and round, then, and ever
contracting towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly
wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital centre,
the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of its cunning
spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy , rising with great force, the coffin life-
buoy shot lengthwis e from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side. Buoyed up
by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on a soft and
dirgelike main. The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with padlocks on
their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks. On the second
day, a sail drew near, nearer , and picked me up at last. It was the devious-
cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her missing children, only
found another orphan. *** END OF THE PROJECT  GUTENBERG EBOOK MOBY  DICK; OR, THE

that the Project Gutenber g™ collection will remain freely available for
generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenber g Literary Archive
Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for
Project Gutenber g™ and future generations. To learn more about the

Project Gutenber g™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable ef fort,
much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these
requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not
received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONA TIONS or
determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
www .gutenber g.org/donate . While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have
not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against
accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us
with of fers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the
United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staf f. Please check the Project Gutenber g web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,

electronic works
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenber g™
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with
anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenber g™
eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenber g™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the
U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep
eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility:
www .gutenber g.org. This website includes information about Project Gutenber g™, including
how to make donations to the Project Gutenber g Literary Archive
Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to
our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.6/26/24, 2:09 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of Moby Dick; Or the Whale, by Herman Melville

https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 11/174CHAPTER I
“Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of
the Buona partes. But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means
war, if you still try to defend the infami es and horrors perpetrated by
that Antichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing
more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my
‘faithful slave,’  as you call yourself!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"But how do you do? I see I have
frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.”
It was in July, 1805 , and the speaker was the well-known Anna
Pávlovna Schérer , maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Márya
Fëdorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a
man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her
reception. Anna Pávlovna had had a cough for some days. She was,
as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe  being then a new word
in St.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Petersbur g, used only by the elite. All her invitations without exception, written in French, and
delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:
“If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the
prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too
terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10
—Annette Schérer .”
“Heavens! what a virulent attack!” replied the prince, not in the
least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an
embroidered court uniform, knee breech es, and shoes, and had stars
on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in
that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but
thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man
of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up
to Anna Pávlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald,
scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the
sofa. “First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’ s
mind at rest,” said he without altering his tone, beneath the
politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even
irony could be discerned. “Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in
times like these if one has any feeling?” said Anna Pávlovna. “You
are staying the whole evening, I hope?”
“And the fete at the English ambassador ’s? Today is Wednesday . I
must put in an appearance there,” said the prince. “My daughter is
coming for me to take me there.”
“I though t today’ s fete had been canceled. I confess all these
festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.”
“If they had known  that you wished it, the entertainment would
have been  put off,” said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by
force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 12/174“Don’ t tease! Well, and what has been decided about
Novosíltsev’ s dispatch? You know everything.”
“What can one say about it?” replied the prince in a cold, listless
tone. “What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte
has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.”
Prince Vasíli always spoke languidly , like an actor repeating a
stale part. Anna Pávlovna Schérer on the contrary , despite her forty
years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"To be an
enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even
when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to
disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued
smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played
round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual
consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor
could, nor considered it necessary , to correct. In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pávlovna
burst out:
“Oh, don’t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don’t understand
things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She
is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious
sovereign recognize s his high vocation and will be true to it.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"That is
the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has
to perform  the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble
that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush
the hydra of revoluti on, which has become more terrible than ever in
the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the
blood of the just one....","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England
with her commerci al spirit will not and cannot understand the
Emperor Alexander ’s loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate
Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our
actions. What answer did Novosíltsev get? None. The English have
not understood and cannot understand the self-abnegation of our
Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only desires the good of
mankind. And what have they promise d?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
Nothing!,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"And what little
they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has always
declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe is
powerless before him.... And I don’t believe a word that Hardenbur g
says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a
trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored
monarch. He will save Europe!”
She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity . “I think,” said the prince with a smile, “that if you had been sent
instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King
of Prussia’ s consent by assault. You are so eloquent.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Will you give
me a cup of tea?”
“In a moment. À propos ,” she added, becoming calm again, “I am
expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de
Mortemart, who is connected with the Montmorencys through the
Rohans, one of the best French families. He is one of the genuine
émigrés , the good ones.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"And also the Abbé Morio. Do you know that
profound thinker? He has been receive d by the Emperor . Had you
heard?”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 13/174“I shall be delighted to meet them,” said the prince. “But tell me,”
he added with studi ed carelessness as if it had only just occurred to
him, thoug h the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of
his visit, “is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to
be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a
poor creature.”
Prince Vasíli wished  to obtain this post for his son, but others were
trying through the Dowager Empress Márya Fëdorovna to secure it
for the baron. Anna Pávlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she
nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or
was pleased with. “Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by
her sister ,” was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone. As she named the Empress, Anna Pávlovna’ s face suddenly
assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect
mingled with sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned
her illustrious patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to
show Baron Funke beaucoup d’estime , and again her face clouded
over with sadness. The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the
womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna
Pávlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had
done of a man recommended to the Emp ress) and at the same time to
console him, so she said:
“Now about your family . Do you know that since your daughter
came out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is
amazingly beautiful.”
The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude. “I often think,” she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer
to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political
and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate
conversation—“I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life
are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I
don’t speak of Anat ole, your youngest. I don’t like him,” she added
in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows. “Two
such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than
anyone, and so you don’ t deserve to have them.”
And she smiled her ecstatic smile. “I can’t help it,” said the prince. “Lava ter would have said I lack
the bump of paternity .”
“Don’ t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know
I am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves” (and
her face assumed its melancholy expression), “he was mentioned at
Her Majesty’ s and you were pitied....”
The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly ,
awaiting a reply . He frowned.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
“What would you have me do?” he said at last.,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“You know I did
all a father could for their education, and they have both turned out
fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That is the only difference between them.” He said this smiling in a6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 14/174way more  natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles
round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly
coarse and unpleasant. “And why are children born to such men as you?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"If you were not a
father there would be nothing I could reproach you with,” said Anna
Pávlovna, looking up pensively . “I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my
children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That is
how I explain it to myself. It can’ t be helped!”
He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a
gesture. Anna Pávlovna meditated. “Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?”
she asked. “They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and
though I don’t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little
person who is very unhappy with her father . She is a relation of
yours, Princess Mary Bolkónskaya.”
Prince Vasíli did not reply , though, with the quickness of memory
and perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a
movement of the head that he was considering this information. “Do you know ,” he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad
current of his thoughts, “that Anatole is costing me forty thousand
rubles a year? And,” he went on after a pause, “what will it be in five
years, if he goes on like this?” Presentl y he added: “That’ s what we
fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?”
“Her fathe r is very rich and stingy . He lives in the country . He is
the well-k nown Prince Bolkónski who had to retire from the army
under the late Emperor , and was nicknam ed ‘the King of Prussia.’  He
is very clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very
unhappy . She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise
Meinen lately . He is an aide-de-camp of Kutúzov’ s and will be here
tonight.”
“Listen, dear Annette,” said the prince, suddenly taking Anna
Pávlovna’ s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. “Arrange that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted
slave- slafe  with an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich and of good family and that’ s all I want.”
And with the famili arity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised
the maid of honor ’s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro
as he lay back in his armchair , looking in another direction. “Attendez,”  said Anna Pávlovna, reflecting, “I’ll speak to Lise,
young Bolkónski’ s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can
be arrange d. It shall be on your family’ s behalf that I’ll start my
apprenticeship as old maid.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 15/174CHAPTER II
Anna Pávlovna’ s drawing room was gradually filling. The highest
Petersbur g society was assembled there: people differing widely in
age and character but alike in the social circle to which they
belonged. Prince Vasíli’ s daughter , the beautiful Hélène, came to take
her father to the ambassador ’s entertain ment; she wore a ball dress
and her badge as maid of honor . The youthful little Princess
Bolkónskaya, known as la femme la plus séduisante de Pétersbour g,
* was also there. She had been married during the previous winter ,
and being  pregnant did not go to any large gatherings, but only to
small receptions. Prince Vasíli’ s son, Hippolyte, had come with
Mortemart, whom he introduced. The Abbé Morio and many others
had also come. * The most fascinating woman in Petersburg. To each new arrival Anna Pávlovna said, “You have not yet seen
my aunt,” or “You do not know my aunt?” and very gravely
conducted him or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of
ribbon in her cap, who had come sailing in from another room as
soon as the guests began to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from
the visitor to her aunt, Anna Pávlovna mentioned each one’s name
and then left them. Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt
whom not one of them knew , not one of them wanted to know , and
not one of them cared about; Anna Pávlovna observed these
greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval. The
aunt spoke  to each of them in the same words, about their health and
her own, and the health of Her Majesty , “who, thank God, was better
today .” And each visitor , though politeness prevented his showing
impatience, left the old woman with a sense of relief at having
performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole
evening. The youn g Princess Bolkónskaya had brought some work in a
gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a
delicate dark down was just perceptible , was too short for her teeth,
but it lifted all the more sweetly , and was especially charming when
she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always the
case with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect—the shortness
of her upper lip and her half-open mouth—seemed to be her own
special and peculiar form of beauty . Everyone brightened at the sight
of this pretty young  woman, so soon to become a mother , so full of
life and health, and carrying her burden so lightly . Old men and dull
dispirited young ones who looked at her, after being in her company
and talkin g to her a little while, felt as if they too were becoming,
like her, full of life and health. All who talked to her, and at each
word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth,
thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 16/174The little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying
steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat
down on a sofa near the silver samovar , as if all she was doing was a
pleasure to herself and to all around her. “I have brought my work,”
said she in French,  displaying her bag and addressing all present. “Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me,”
she added, turning to her hostess. “You wrote that it was to be quite a
small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed.” And she
spread out her arms  to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty
gray dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast. “Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone
else,” replied Anna Pávlovna. “You know ,” said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in
French, turning to a general, “my husband is deserting me? He is
going to get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?”
she added , addressing Prince Vasíli, and without waiting for an
answer she turned to speak to his daughter , the beautiful Hélène. “What a delightful woman this little princess is!” said Prince
Vasíli to Anna Pávlovna. One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with
close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light- colored breeches fashionable
at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout
young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezúkhov , a well-
known grandee of Catherine’ s time who now lay dying in Moscow . The youn g man had not yet entered either the military or civil
service, as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been
educated, and this was his first appearance in society . Anna Pávlovna
greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her
drawing room. But in spite of this lowest-grade greeting, a look of
anxiety and fear, as at the sight of something too large and unsuited
to the place, came over her face when she saw Pierre enter . Though
he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, her
anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy, but
observant and natural, expression which distinguished him from
everyone else in that drawing room. “It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor
invalid,” said Anna Pávlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with
her aunt as she conducted him to her . Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look
round as if in search  of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed
to the little princess with a pleased  smile, as to an intimate
acquaintance. Anna Pávlovna’ s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from
the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty’ s
health. Anna Pávlovna in dismay detain ed him with the words: “Do
you know the Abbé Morio? He is a most interesting man.”
“Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very
interesting but hardly feasible.”
“You think so?” rejoined Anna Pávlovna in order to say something
and get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now
committed a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady
before she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 17/174speak to another who wished to get away . With his head bent, and his
big feet spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking
the abbé’ s plan chimerical. “We will talk of it later ,” said Anna Pávlovna with a smile. And havin g got rid of this young man who did not know how to
behave, she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and
watch, ready to help at any point where the conversation might
happen to flag. As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set
the hands to work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has
stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should,
and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna
Pávlovna moved about her drawing room, approaching now a silent,
now a too-noisy group, and by a word or slight rearrangement kept
the conversational machine in steady , proper , and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident. She kept
an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round
Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and again when he
passed to another group whose center was the abbé. Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna
Pávlovna’ s was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all
the intellectual lights of Petersbur g were gathered there and, like a
child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of
missing any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the
self-confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he
was always expecting to hear somethin g very profound. At last he
came up to Morio. Here the conversation seemed interesting and he
stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views, as young
people are fond of doing.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 18/174CHAPTER III
Anna Pávlovna’ s reception was in full swing. The spindles
hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of
the aunt, beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin
careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society , the
whole company had settled into three groups. One, chiefly
masculine, had formed round the abbé. Another , of young people,
was grouped round the beautiful Princess Hélène, Prince Vasíli’ s
daughter , and the little Princess Bolkónskaya, very pretty and rosy,
though rather too plump for her age. The third group was gathered
round Mortemart and Anna Pávlovna. The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and
polished manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but
out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle
in which he found himself. Anna Pávlovna was obviously serving
him up as a treat to her guests. As a clever maître d’hôtel serves up
as a speci ally choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had
seen it in the kitch en would have cared to eat, so Anna Pávlovna
served up to her guests, first the vicomte and then the abbé, as
peculiarly choice morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately
began discussing the murder of the Duc d’Enghien. The vicomte said
that the Duc d’Engh ien had perished by his own magnanimity , and
that there were particular reasons for Buonaparte’ s hatred of him. “Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,” said Anna Pávlovna,
with a pleasant feeling that there was something à la Louis  XV in the
sound of that sentence: “Contez nous çela, V icomte.”
The vicom te bowed and smiled courteously in token of his
willingness to comply . Anna Pávlovna arranged a group round him,
inviting everyone to listen to his tale. “The vicomte knew the duc personally ,” whispered Anna Pávlovna
to one of the guests. “The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur ,” said
she to another . “How  evidently he belongs to the best society ,” said
she to a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the
choicest and most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of
roast beef on a hot dish. The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile. “Come over here, Hélène, dear,” said Anna Pávlovna to the
beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of
another group. The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile
with whic h she had first entered the room—the smile of a perfectly
beautiful woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed
with moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and
sparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for
her, not looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously
allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and
shapely shoulders, back, and bosom—which in the fashion of those6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 19/174days were very much exposed—and she seemed to bring the glamour
of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna Pávlovna. Hélène
was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry ,
but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and
all too victorious beauty . She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to
diminish its ef fect. “How lovely!” said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted
his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something
extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him
also with her unchanging smile. “Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,” said he,
smilingly inclining his head. The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and
considered a reply unnecessary . She smilingly waited. All the time
the story was being told she sat upright, glancing now at her
beautiful round arm, altered in shape by its pressure on the table,
now at her still more beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a
diamond necklace. From time to time she smoothed the folds of her
dress, and whenever the story produc ed an effect she glanced at
Anna Pávlovna, at once adopted just the expression she saw on the
maid of honor ’s face, and again relapsed into her radiant smile. The little princess had also left the tea table and followed Hélène. “Wait a moment, I’ll get my work.... Now then, what are you
thinking of?” she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. “Fetch me
my workbag.”
There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and
talking merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged
herself in her seat. “Now I am all right ,” she said, and asking the vicomte to begin,
she took up her work. Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle
and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her . Le charmant Hippolyte  was surprising by his extraordinar y
resemblance to his beautiful sister , but yet more by the fact that in
spite of this resembl ance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were
like his sister ’s, but while in her case everything was lit up by a
joyous, self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and
by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the
contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen
self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes, nose,
and mouth all seem ed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and
his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions. “It’s not going to be a ghost story?” said he, sitting down beside
the prince ss and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this
instrument he could not begin to speak. “Why no, my dear fellow ,” said the astonished narrator , shrugging
his shoulders. “Because I hate ghost stories,” said Prince Hippolyte in a tone
which showed that he only understood  the meaning of his words
after he had uttered them.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 20/174He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be
sure whet her what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was
dressed in a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of
cuisse de nymphe effrayée , as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"The vicomte told his tale very neatly . It was an anecdote, then
current, to the effect that the Duc d’Enghien had gone secretly to
Paris to visit Madem oiselle Geor ge; that at her house he came upon
Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress’  favors, and that in
his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to
which he was subject, and was thus at the duc’s mercy . The latter
spared him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by
death. The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point
where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies
looked agitated. “Charming!” said Anna Pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the
little princess. “Charming!” whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into
her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story
prevented her from going on with it. The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully
prepared to continue, but just then Anna Pávlovna, who had kept a
watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he
was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbé, so she hurried
to the rescue. Pierre  had managed to start a conversation with the
abbé about the balan ce of power , and the latter , evidently interested
by the young man’ s simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet
theory . Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally ,
which was why Anna Pávlovna disapproved. “The means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights
of the people,” the abbé was saying. “It is only necessary for one
powerful nation like Russia—barbaric as she is said to be—to place
herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object
the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would
save the world!”
“But how are you to get that balance?” Pierre was beginning. At that moment Anna Pávlovna came up and, looking severely at
Pierre, asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italian’ s
face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary
expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women. “I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the
society , more especially of the feminine society , in which I have had
the honor of being received, that I have  not yet had time to think of
the climate,” said he. Not letting the abbé  and Pierre escape, Anna Pávlovna, the more
conveniently to keep them under observ ation, brought them into the
larger circle.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

Just then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew
Bolkónski, the little princess’  husband . He was a very handsome
young man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything about him, from his weary , bored expression to his quiet,
measured step, offered a most striking  contrast to his quiet, little
wife. It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing
room, but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to
look at or listen to them. And among all these faces that he found so
tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned  away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome
face, kissed Anna Pávlovna’ s hand, and screwing up his eyes
scanned the whole company . “You are of f to the war , Prince?” said Anna Pávlovna. “General Kutúzov ,” said Bolkónski, speaking French and stressing
the last syllable of the general’ s name like a Frenchman, “has been
pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....”
“And Lise, your wife?”
“She will go to the country .”
“Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?”
“André,”  said his wife, addressing her husband in the same
coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, “the vicomte has
been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle Geor ge and
Buonaparte!”
Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away . Pierre, who
from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him
with glad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before
he looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his
annoyance with whoever was touching his arm, but when he saw
Pierre’ s beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and
pleasant smile. “There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?” said he to
Pierre. “I knew you would be here,” replied Pierre. “I will come to supper
with you. May I?” he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the
vicomte who was continuing his story . “No, impossible!” said Prince Andrew , laughing and pressing
Pierre’ s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He
wished to say somet hing more, but at that moment Prince Vasíli and
his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them
pass. “You must excuse me, dear Vicomte,”  said Prince Vasíli to the
Frenchman, holding  him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to
prevent his rising. “This unfortunate fete at the ambassador ’s
deprives me of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 22/174sorry to leave your enchanting party ,” said he, turning to Anna
Pávlovna. His daughter , Princess Hélène, passed between the chairs, lightly
holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more
radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous,
almost frightened, eyes as she passed him. “Very lovely ,” said Prince Andrew . “Very,” said Pierre. In passing Prince Vasíli seized Pierre’ s hand and said to Anna
Pávlovna: “Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a
whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society . Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever
women.”
Anna Pávlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She
knew his father to be a connection of Prince Vasíli’ s. The elderly
lady who had been  sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and
overtook Prince Vasíli in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest
she had assumed had left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now
expressed only anxiety and fear . “How about my son Borís, Prince?” said she, hurrying after him
into the anteroom. “I can’t remain any longer in Petersbur g. Tell me
what news I may take back to my poor boy .”
Although Prince Vasíli listened reluctantly and not very politely to
the elderly  lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an
ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not
go away . “What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor , and then he
would be transferred to the Guards at once?” said she. “Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,” answered
Prince Vasíli, “but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor . I should
advise you to appea l to Rumyántsev through Prince Golítsyn. That
would be the best way .”
The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskáya, belonging to one of
the best families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been
out of society had lost her former influ ential connections. She had
now come to Petersb urg to procure an appointment in the Guards for
her only son. It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasíli that she had
obtained an invitation to Anna Pávlov na’s reception and had sat
listening to the vicomte’ s story . Prince Vasíli’ s words frightened her,
an embitte red look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a
moment; then she smiled again and clutched Prince Vasíli’ s arm
more tightly . “Listen to me, Prince,” said she. “I have never yet asked you for
anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my
father ’s friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God’ s sake to
do this for my son—and I shall always regard you as a benefactor ,”
she added  hurriedly . “No, don’t be angry , but promise! I have asked
Golítsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always
were,” she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 23/174“Papa, we shall be late,” said Princ ess Hélène, turning her
beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as
she stood waiting by the door . Influence in society , however , is a capital which has to be
economized if it is to last. Prince Vasíli knew this, and having once
realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he
would soon be unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using
his influence. But in Princess Drubetskáya’ s case he felt, after her
second appeal, something like qualms of conscience. She had
reminded him of what was quite true; he had been indebted to her
father for the first steps in his career . Moreover , he could see by her
manners that she was one of those women—mostly mothers—who,
having once made up their minds, will not rest until they have gained
their end, and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after
day and hour after hour, and even to make scenes. This last
consideration moved him. “My dear Anna Mikháylovna,” said he with his usual familiarity
and weariness of tone, “it is almost impossible for me to do what you
ask; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father ’s
memory , I will do the impossible—you r son shall be transferred to
the Guards. Here is my hand on it.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Are you satisfied?”
“My dear benefacto r! This is what I expected from you—I knew
your kindness!” He turned to go. “Wait—just a word! When he has been transferred to the
Guards...” she faltered. “You are on good terms with Michael
Ilariónovich Kutúzo v ... recommend Borís to him as adjutant! Then I
shall be at rest, and then...”
Prince Vasíli smiled. “No, I won’ t prom ise that. You don’t know how Kutúzov is
pestered since his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me
himself that all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all
their sons as adjutants.”
“No, but do promise! I won’ t let you go! My dear benefactor ...”
“Papa,” said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before, “we
shall be late.”
“Well, au revoir!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Good-by! You hear her?”
“Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?”
“Certainly; but about Kutúzov , I don’ t promise.”
“Do promise, do promise, Vasíli!” cried Anna Mikháylovna as he
went, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably
came naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn
face. Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit
employed all the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had
gone her face resumed its former cold, artificial expression. She
returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking, and again
pretended to listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her
task was accomplished.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

“And what do you think of this latest comedy , the coronation at
Milan?” asked Anna Pávlovna, “and of the comedy of the people of
Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte,
and Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the
petitions of the nations? Adorable!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"It is enough to make one’s head
whirl! It is as if the whole world had gone crazy .”
Prince Andrew looked Anna Pávlovna straight in the face with a
sarcastic smile. “‘Dieu me la donne, gare à qui la touche!’ ’ * They say he was
very fine when he said that,” he remar ked, repeating the words in
Italian: “‘Dio mi l’ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!’ ’
* God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware! “I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run
over,” Anna Pávlovna continued. “The sovereigns will not be able to
endure this man who is a menace to everything.”
“The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,” said the vicomte,
polite but hopeless: “The sovereigns, madame... What have they
done for Louis XVII, for the Queen,  or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!” and he became more animated. “And believe me, they are
reaping the reward of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause. The
sovereigns! Why , they are sending ambassadors to compliment the
usurper .”
And sighing disdainfully , he again changed his position. Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing  at the vicomte for some
time through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward
the little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the
Condé coat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as
much gravity as if she had asked him to do it. “Bâton de gueules, engrêlé de gueules  d’azur—maison Condé,”
said he. The princess listened, smiling. “If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer ,” the
vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which
he is bette r acquaint ed than anyone else, does not listen to others but
follows the current of his own thoughts , “things will have gone too
far. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French society—I
mean good French society—will have been forever destroyed, and
then....”
He shrugg ed his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished
to make a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna
Pávlovna, who had him under observation, interrupted:
“The Emperor Alexander ,” said she, with the melancholy which
always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family ,6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 25/174“has declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to
choose their own form of government; and I believe that once free
from the usurper , the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the
arms of its rightful king,” she concluded, trying to be amiable to the
royalist emigrant. “That is doubtful,” said Prince Andrew . “Monsieur le Vicomte
quite rightly supposes that matters have  already gone too far. I think
it will be dif ficult to return to the old regime.”
“From what I have heard,” said Pierre, blushing and breaking into
the conversation, “almost all the aristocr acy has already gone over to
Bonaparte’ s side.”
“It is the Buonapartists who say that,” replied the vicomte without
looking at Pierre. “At the present time it is difficult to know the real
state of French public opinion.”
“Bonaparte has said so,” remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic
smile. It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his
remarks at him, though without looking at him. “‘I showe d them the path to glory , but they did not follow it,’”
Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting
Napoleon’ s words. “‘I opened my antechambers and they crowded
in.’ I do not know how far he was justified in saying so.”
“Not in the least,” replied the vicomte. “After the murder of the
duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some
people,” he went on, turning to Anna Pávlovna, “he ever was a hero,
after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and
one hero less on earth.”
Before Anna Pávlovna and the others  had time to smile their
appreciation of the vicomte’ s epigram, Pierre again broke into the
conversation, and though Anna Pávlo vna felt sure he would say
something inappropriate, she was unable to stop him. “The execution of the Duc d’Enghien,” declared Monsieur Pierre,
“was a political necessity , and it seems to me that Napoleon showed
greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole
responsibility of that deed.”
“Dieu! Mon Dieu!”  muttered Anna Pávlovna in a terrified
whisper . “What, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination
shows greatness of soul?” said the little princess, smiling and
drawing her work nearer to her . “Oh!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Oh!” exclaimed several voices. “Capital!” said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping
his knee with the palm of his hand. The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked
solemnly at his audience over his spectacles and continued. “I say so,” he continued desperately , “because the Bourbons fled
from the Revolution leaving the peopl e to anarchy , and Napoleon
alone understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the
general good, he could not stop short for the sake of one man’ s life.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 26/174“Won’t you come over to the other table?” suggested Anna
Pávlovna. But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her . “No,” cried he, becoming more and more eager , “Napoleon is
great because he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its
abuses, preserved all that was good in it—equality of citizenship and
freedom of speech and of the press—an d only for that reason did he
obtain power .”
“Yes, if having obtained power , without availing himself of it to
commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have
called him a great man,” remarked the vicomte. “He could not do that. The people only gave him power that he
might rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a
great man. The Revolution was a grand thing!” continued Monsieur
Pierre, betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his
extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind. “What? Revolution and regicide a grand  thing?... Well, after that...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"But won’ t you come to this other table?” repeated Anna Pávlovna. “Rousseau’ s Contrat Social ,” said the vicomte with a tolerant
smile. “I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas.”
“Yes: ideas of robbery , murder , and regicide,” again interjected an
ironical voice. “Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most
important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation
from prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas
Napoleon has retained in full force.”
“Liberty and equality ,” said the vicomt e contemptuously , as if at
last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words
were, “high-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who
does not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty
and equality . Have people since the Revolution become happier? On
the contrary . We wanted liberty , but Buonaparte has destroyed it.”
Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to
the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first
moment of Pierre’ s outburst Anna Pávlovna, despite her social
experience, was horror -struck. But when she saw that Pierre’ s
sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte, and had
convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him, she rallied her
forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator . “But, my dear Mon sieur Pierre,” said she, “how do you explain
the fact of a great man executing a duc—or even an ordinary man
who—is innocent and untried?”
“I should like,” said the vicomte, “to ask how monsieur explains
the 18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and
not at all like the conduct of a great man!”
“And the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!” said
the little princess, shrugging her shoulders. “He’ s a low fellow, say what you will,” remarked Prince
Hippolyte.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 27/174Pierre, not knowing whom to answer , looked at them all and
smiled. His smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he
smiled, his grave, even rather gloomy , look was instantaneously
replaced by another—a childlike, kindly , even rather silly look,
which seemed to ask for giveness. The vicom te who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly
that this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested. All were silent. “How do you expect him to answer you all at once?” said Prince
Andrew . “Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to
distinguish between  his acts as a private  person, as a general, and as
an emperor . So it seems to me.”
“Yes, yes, of course!” Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of
this reinforcement. “One must admit,” continued Prince Andrew , “that Napoleon as a
man was great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa
where he gave his hand to the plague-s tricken; but ... but there are
other acts which it is dif ficult to justify .”
Prince Andrew , who had evidently wished to tone down the
awkwardness of Pierre’ s remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife
that it was time to go. Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to
attend, and asking them all to be seated began:
“I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to
it. Excuse me, Vicomte—I must tell it in Russian or the point will be
lost....” And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian
as a Frenc hman would speak after spending about a year in Russia. Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their
attention to his story . “There is in Moscow  a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She
must have two footm en behind her carriage, and very big ones. That
was her taste. And she had a lady’ s maid, also big. She said....”
Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with
difficulty . “She said.... Oh yes! She said, ‘Girl,’  to the maid, ‘put on a livery ,
get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some
calls.’”
Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long
before his audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the
narrator . Several persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna
Pávlovna, did however smile. “She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat
and her long hair came down....” Here he could contain himself no
longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: “And the whole
world knew ....”
And so the anecdot e ended. Though it was unintelligible why he
had told it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pávlovna
and the others appreciated Prince Hippolyte’ s social tact in so
agreeably ending Pierre’ s unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After
the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

Having thanked Anna Pávlovna for her charming soiree, the guests
began to take their leave. Pierre was ungainly . Stout, about the average height, broad, with
huge red hands; he did not know , as the saying is, how to enter a
drawing room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say
something particularly agreeable before going away . Besides this he
was absent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his
own, the general’ s three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the
plume, till the general asked him to restore it. All his absent-
mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was,
however , redeemed by his kindly , simple, and modest expression. Anna Pávlovna turned toward him and, with a Christian mildness
that expressed forgiveness of his indis cretion, nodded and said: “I
hope to see you again, but I also hope you will change your opinions,
my dear Monsieur Pierre.”
When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again
everybody saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps,
“Opinions are opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured
fellow I am.” And everyone, including Anna Pávlovna, felt this. Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his
shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak,
listened indifferently to his wife’ s chatte r with Prince Hippolyte who
had also come into the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the
pretty , pregnant princess, and stared fixedly at her through his
eyeglass. “Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold,” said the little princess,
taking leave of Anna Pávlovna. “It is settled,” she added in a low
voice. Anna Pávlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the
match she contemplated between Anatole and the little princess’
sister -in-law . “I rely on you, my dear,” said Anna Pávlovna, also in a low tone. “Write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter . Au
revoir! ”—and she left the hall. Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his
face close to her , began to whisper something. Two footm en, the princess’  and his own, stood holding a shawl
and a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. They listened to
the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of
understanding but not wishing to appe ar to do so. The princess as
usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh. “I am very glad I did not go to the ambassador ’s,” said Prince
Hippolyte “—so dull—. It has been a delightful evening, has it not? Delightful!”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 30/174“They say the ball will be very good,” replied the princess,
drawing up her downy little lip. “All the pretty women in society
will be there.”
“Not all, for you will not be there; not all,” said Prince Hippolyte
smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom
he even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess. Either from awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said
which) after the shawl had been adjuste d he kept his arm around her
for a long time, as though embracing her . Still smiling, she gracefully moved away , turning and glancing at
her husband. Prince Andrew’ s eyes were  closed, so weary and sleepy
did he seem. “Are you ready?” he asked his wife, looking past her . Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest
fashion reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into
the porch following the princess, whom a footman was helping into
the carriage. “Princesse, au revoir ,” cried he, stumbling with his tongue as well
as with his feet. The princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the dark
carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince Hippolyte,
under pretense of helping, was in everyone’ s way . “Allow me, sir,” said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold,
disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path. “I am expecting you, Pierre,” said the same voice, but gently and
affectionately . The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte
laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the
vicomte whom he had promised to take home. “Well, mon cher,” said the vicomte, having seated himself beside
Hippolyte in the carriage, “your little princess is very nice, very nice
indeed, quite French ,” and he kissed the tips of his fingers. Hippolyte
burst out laughing. “Do you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,”
continued the vicomte. “I pity the poor husband, that little officer
who gives himself the airs of a monarch.”
Hippolyte spluttered  again, and amid his laughter said, “And you
were sayin g that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One
has to know how to deal with them.”
Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew’ s study
like one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the
sofa, took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was
Caesar ’s Commentaries ), and resting on his elbow , began reading it
in the middle. “What have you done to Mlle Schérer? She will be quite ill now,”
said Prince Andrew , as he entered the study , rubbing his small white
hands. Pierre turned his whole body , making the sofa creak. He lifted his
eager face to Prince Andrew , smiled, and waved his hand.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 31/174“That abbé is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the
right light.... In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but—I do not
know how to express it ... not by a balance of political power ....”
It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such
abstract conversation. “One can’t everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher. Well, have
you at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or
a diplomatist?” asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence. Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him. “Really , I don’ t yet know . I don’ t like either the one or the other .”
“But you must decide on something! Your father expects it.”
Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbé as tutor,
and had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to
Moscow his father dismissed the abbé and said to the young man,
“Now go to Petersbur g, look round, and choose your profession. I
will agree  to anything. Here is a letter to Prince Vasíli, and here is
money . Write to me all about it, and I will help you in everything.”
Pierre had already been choosing a career for three months, and had
not decided on anyth ing. It was about this choice that Prince Andrew
was speaking. Pierre rubbed his forehead. “But he must be a Freemason,” said he, referring to the abbé
whom he had met that evening. “That is all nonsens e.” Prince Andrew again interrupted him, “let
us talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?”
“No, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted
to tell you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for
freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the
army; but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the
world is not right.”
Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre’ s childish
words. He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to
such nons ense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any
other answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naïve question. “If no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no
wars,” he said. “And that would be splendid,” said Pierre. Prince Andrew smiled ironically . “Very likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about....”
“Well, why are you going to the war?” asked Pierre. “What for?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
I don’t know .,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"I must. Besides that I am going....” He
paused. “I am going  because the life I am leading here does not suit
me!”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

The rustle of a woman’ s dress was heard in the next room. Prince
Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the
look it had had in Anna Pávlovna’ s drawing room. Pierre removed
his feet from the sofa. The princess came in. She had changed her
gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other . Prince
Andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her . “How is it,” she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly
and fussily in the easy chair , “how is it Annette never got married? How stupi d you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for
saying so, but you have no sense about women. What an
argumentative fellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!”
“And I am still arguing with your husba nd. I can’t understand why
he wants to go to the war,” replied Pierre, addressing the princess
with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men
in their intercourse with young women. The princess started. Evidently Pierre’ s words touched her to the
quick. “Ah, that is just what I tell him!” said she. “I don’t understand it; I
don’t in the least understand why men can’t live without wars. How
is it that we women don’t want anythin g of the kind, don’t need it? Now you shall judge between us. I always tell him: Here he is
Uncle’ s aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position. He is so well known,
so much appreciated  by everyone. The other day at the Apráksins’  I
heard a lady asking, ‘Is that the famous Prince Andrew?’  I did
indeed.” She laughed. “He is so well received everywhere. He might
easily become aide-de-camp to the Emp eror. You know the Emperor
spoke to him most graciously . Annette and I were speaking of how to
arrange it. What do you think?”
Pierre looked at his friend and, noticin g that he did not like the
conversation, gave no reply . “When are you starting?” he asked. “Oh, don’t speak of his going, don’t! I won’ t hear it spoken of,”
said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had
spoken to Hippolyte  in the drawing room and which was so plainly
ill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member . “Today when I remembered that all these delightful associations
must be broken off ... and then you know, André...” (she looked
significantly at her husband) “I’m afraid, I’m afraid!” she whispered,
and a shudder ran down her back. Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone
besides Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a
tone of frigid politeness. “What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don’ t understand,” said he. “There, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a whim
of his own, goodnes s only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

“With my father and sister , remember ,” said Prince Andrew gently . “Alone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not
to be afraid.”
Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a
joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if she
felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the
gist of the matter lay in that. “I still can’t under stand what you are afraid of,” said Prince
Andrew slowly , not taking his eyes of f his wife. The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of
despair . “No, Andrew , I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have....”
“Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,” said Prince Andrew . “You had better go.”
The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip
quivered. Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked
about the room. Pierre looked over his spectacles with naïve surprise, now at him
and now at her , moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind. “Why should I mind  Monsieur Pierre being here?” exclaimed the
little princ ess suddenly , her pretty face all at once distorted by a
tearful grimace. “I have long wanted to ask you, Andrew , why you
have chan ged so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to
the war and have no pity for me. Why is it?”
“Lise!” was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed
an entreaty , a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself
regret her words. But she went on hurriedly:
“You treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you
behave like that six months ago?”
“Lise, I beg you to desist,” said Prince Andrew still more
emphatically . Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he
listened to all this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed
unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself. “Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because.... I assure
you I myself have experienced ... and so ...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
because ...,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"No, excuse
me! An outsider is out of place here.... No, don’t distress yourself.... Good-by!”
Prince Andrew caught him by the hand. “No, wait,  Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me
of the pleasure of spending the evening with you.”
“No, he thinks only of himself,” muttered the princess without
restraining her angry tears. “Lise!” said Prince Andrew dryly , raising his voice to the pitch
which indicates that patience is exhausted. Suddenly the angry , squirrel-like expression of the princess’  pretty
face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful
eyes glanc ed askance at her husband’ s face, and her own assumed6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

wags its drooping tail. “Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!”  she mutte red, and lifting her dress with
one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead. “Good night, Lise,”  said he, rising and courteously kissing her
hand as he would have done to a stranger .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

The friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre
continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his
forehead with his small hand. “Let us go and have supper ,” he said with a sigh, going to the
door. They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining
room. Everything from the table napk ins to the silver , china, and
glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the
newly married. Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his
elbows on the table and, with a look of nervous agitation such as
Pierre had never before seen on his face, began to talk—as one who
has long had some thing on his mind and suddenly determines to
speak out. “Never , never marr y, my dear fellow! That’ s my advice: never
marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are
capable of, and until you have ceased to love the woman of your
choice and have seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make a
cruel and irrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old and good for
nothing—or all that is good and noble in you will be lost. It will all
be wasted  on trifles.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
Yes!,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
Yes!,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
Yes!,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Don’ t look at me with such
surprise. If you marr y expecting anything from yourself in the future,
you will feel at every step that for you all is ended, all is closed
except the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side with
a court lackey and an idiot!... But what’ s the good?...” and he waved
his arm. Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different
and the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his
friend in amazement. “My wife, ” continue d Prince Andrew , “is an excellent woman, one
of those rare women with whom a man’ s honor is safe; but, O God,
what would I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and
only one to whom I mention this, because I like you.”
As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that
Bolkónski who had lolled in Anna Pávlovna’ s easy chairs and with
half-closed eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every
muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement;
his eyes, in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now
flashed with brilliant light. It was evident that the more lifeless he
seemed at ordinary times, the more impassioned he became in these
moments of almost morbid irritation. “You don’t understa nd why I say this,” he continued, “but it is the
whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career ,” said he
(though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), “but Bonaparte when
he worked  went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had
nothing but his aim to consider , and he reached it. But tie yourself up
with a woman and, like a chained convi ct, you lose all freedom! And6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 36/174all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and
torments you with regret. Drawing room s, gossip, balls, vanity , and
triviality—these are the enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I am
now going to the war, the greatest war there ever was, and I know
nothing and am fit for nothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic
wit,” continued Prince Andrew , “and at Anna Pávlovna’ s they listen
to me. And that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist, and
those women.... If you only knew what those society women are, and
women in general! My father is right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in
everything—that’ s what women are when you see them in their true
colors! When you meet them in socie ty it seems as if there were
something in them, but there’ s nothing,  nothing, nothing! No, don’t
marry , my dear fellow; don’ t marry!” concluded Prince Andrew . “It seems funny to me,” said Pierre, “that you, you should consider
yourself incapable and your life a spoil ed life.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"You have everything
before you, everything. And you....”
He did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he
thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future. “How can he talk like that?” thought Pierre. He considered his
friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the
highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might
be best described as strength of will. Pierre was always astonished at
Prince Andrew’ s calm manner of treating everybody , his
extraordinary mem ory, his extensive reading (he had read
everything, knew everything, and had an opinion about everything),
but above all at his capacity for work and study . And if Pierre was
often struck by Andrew’ s lack of capacity for philosophical
meditation (to which he himself was particularly addicted), he
regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength. Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life,
praise and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to
wheels that they may run smoothly . “My part is played out,” said Prince Andrew . “What’ s the use of
talking about me? Let us talk about you,” he added after a silence,
smiling at his reassuring thoughts. That smile was immediately reflected on Pierre’ s face. “But what is there to say about me?” said Pierre, his face relaxing
into a careless, merry smile. “What am I? An illegitimate son!” He
suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great
effort to say this. “Without a name and without means... And it
really ...” But he did not say what “it really” was. “For the present I
am free and am all right. Only I haven’ t the least idea what I am to
do; I wanted to consult you seriously .”
Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance—friendly and
affectionate as it was—expressed a sense of his own superiority . “I am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among
our whole  set. Yes, you’re all right!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Choose what you will; it’s all the
same.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"You’ll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up visiting
those Kurá gins and leading that sort of life. It suits you so badly—all
this debauchery , dissipation, and the rest of it!”
“What would you have, my dear fellow?” answered Pierre,
shrugging his shoulders. “W omen, my dear fellow; women!”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 37/174“I don’t understand it,” replied Prince Andrew . “Women who are
comme il faut, that’s a different matter; but the Kurágins’  set of
women, ‘women and wine’  I don’ t understand!”
Pierre was staying at Prince Vasíli Kurágin’ s and sharing the
dissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning
to reform by marrying him to Prince Andrew’ s sister . “Do you know?” said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy
thought, “seriously , I have long been thinking of it....","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Leading such a
life I can’t decide or think properly about anything. One’ s head
aches, and one spends all one’s money . He asked me for tonight, but
I won’ t go.”
“You give me your word of honor not to go?”
“On my honor!”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

It was past one o’clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a
cloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending
to drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more
he felt the impossibility of going to sleep  on such a night. It was light
enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more
like morning or evening than night. On the way Pierre remembered
that Anato le Kurágin was expecting the usual set for cards that
evening, after which there was general ly a drinking bout, finishing
with visits of a kind Pierre was very fond of. “I should like to go to Kurágin’ s,” thought he. But he immediately recalled his promis e to Prince Andrew not to
go there. Then, as happens to people of weak character , he desired so
passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so
accustomed to that he decided to go. The thought immediately
occurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no
account, because before he gave it he had already promised Prince
Anatole to come to his gathering; “besides,” thought he, “all such
‘words of honor ’ are conventional things with no definite meaning,
especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or
something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and
dishonor will be all the same!” Pierre often indulged in reflections of
this sort, nullifying all his decisions and intentions. He went to
Kurágin’ s. Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards’  barracks, in
which Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the
stairs, and went in at the open door. There was no one in the
anteroom; empty bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about;
there was a smell of alcohol, and soun ds of voices and shouting in
the distance. Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed. Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were
the remain s of supper . A footman, thinking no one saw him, was
drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses. From the third room
came sounds of laughter , the shouting of familiar voices, the
growling of a bear, and general commotion. Some eight or nine
young men were crowding anxiously round an open window . Three
others were romping with a young bear, one pulling him by the chain
and trying to set him at the others. “I bet a hundred on Stevens!” shouted one. “Mind, no holding on!” cried another . “I bet on Dólokhov!” cried a third. “Kurágin, you part our hands.”
“There, leave Bruin alone; here’ s a bet on.”
“At one draught, or he loses!” shouted a fourth. “Jacob, bring a bottle!” shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow
who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 39/174linen shirt unfastened in front. “Wait a bit, you fellows....","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Here is
Pétya! Good man!” cried he, addressing Pierre. Another voice, from  a man of medium height with clear blue eyes,
particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring,
cried from the window: “Come here; part the bets!” This was
Dólokhov , an officer of the Semënov regiment, a notorious gambler
and duelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking
about him merrily .","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“I don’ t understand. What’ s it all about?”
“Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here,” said Anatole, and
taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre. “First of all you must drink!”
Pierre drank one glass after another , looking from under his brows
at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window , and
listening to their chatter . Anatole kept on refilling Pierre’ s glass
while explaining that Dólokhov was betting with Stevens, an English
naval officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer
ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out. “Go on, you must drink it all,” said Anatole, giving Pierre the last
glass, “or I won’ t let you go!”
“No, I won’ t,” said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up
to the window . Dólokhov was holding the Englishman’ s hand and clearly and
distinctly repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself
particularly to Anatole and Pierre. Dólokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue
eyes. He was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore no
mustache, so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face,
was clearly seen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely
curved. The middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed
firmly on the firm lower one, and something like two distinct smiles
played continually round the two corner s of the mouth; this, together
with the resolute, insolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect
which made it impossible not to notic e his face. Dólokhov was a
man of small means  and no connections. Yet, though Anatole spent
tens of thousands of rubles, Dólokhov lived with him and had placed
himself on such a footing that all who knew them, including Anatole
himself, respected him more than they did Anatole. Dólokhov could
play all games and nearly always won. However much he drank, he
never lost his clearheadedness. Both Kurágin and Dólokhov were at
that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of Petersbur g. The bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which
prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out
by two footmen, who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the
directions and shouts of the gentlemen around. Anatole with his swaggering air strod e up to the window . He
wanted to smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at
the frame, but could not move it. He smashed a pane. “You have a try , Hercules,” said he, turning to Pierre. Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame
out with a crash.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 40/174“Take it right out, or they’ll think I’m holding on,” said Dólokhov . “Is the Englishman bragging?...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
Eh?,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Is it all right?” said Anatole. “First-rate,” said Pierre, looking at Dólo khov , who with a bottle of
rum in his hand was approaching the window , from which the light
of the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was
visible. Dólokhov , the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the
window sill. “Listen!” cried he, standing there and addressing those
in the room.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"All were silent. “I bet fifty imperials”—he spoke French that the Englishman
might understand him, but he did not speak it very well—“I bet fifty
imperials ... or do you wish to make  it a hundred?” added he,
addressing the Englishman. “No, fifty ,” replied the latter . “All right. Fifty imperials ... that I will drink a whole bottle of rum
without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this
spot” (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the
window) “and without holding on to anything. Is that right?”
“Quite right,” said the Englishman. Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the
buttons of his coat and looking down at him—the Englishman was
short—began repeating the terms of the wager to him in English. “Wait!” cried Dólokhov , hammering with the bottle on the
window sill to attract attention. “Wait a bit, Kurágin. Listen! If
anyone else does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do
you understand?”
The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he
intended to accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him,
and though he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole
went on translating Dólokhov’ s words into English. A thin young lad,
an hussar of the Life Guards, who had been losing that evening,
climbed on the window sill, leaned over , and looked down. “Oh!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Oh! Oh!” he muttered, looking down from the window at the
stones of the pavement. “Shut up!” cried Dólokhov , pushing him away from the window . The lad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his
spurs. Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it
easily , Dólokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window
and lowered his legs. Pressing against both sides of the window , he
adjusted himself on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the
right and then to the left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought two
candles and placed them on the window  sill, though it was already
quite light. Dólokhov’ s back in his white shirt, and his curly head,
were lit up from both sides. Everyone crowded to the window , the
Englishman in front. Pierre stood smilin g but silent. One man, older
than the others present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and
angry look and wanted to seize hold of Dólokhov’ s shirt. “I say , this is folly!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"He’ll be killed,” said this more sensible man. Anatole stopped him.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 41/174“Don’ t touch him! You’ll startle him and then he’ll be killed. Eh?...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"What then?... Eh?”
Dólokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands,
arranged himself on his seat. “If anyone  comes meddling again,” said he, emitting the words
separately through his thin compressed lips, “I will throw him down
there. Now then!”
Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the
bottle and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free
hand to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to
pick up some broke n glass remained in that position without taking
his eyes from the window and from Dólokhov’ s back. Anatole stood
erect with staring eyes. The Englishman  looked on sideways, pursing
up his lips. The man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner
of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his
features now expressed horror and fear. All were still. Pierre took his
hands from  his eyes. Dólokhov still sat in the same position, only his
head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt
collar , and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher
and tremb led with the effort. The bottle was emptying perceptibly
and rising still highe r and his head tilting yet further back. “Why is it
so long?” thought Pierre. It seemed to him that more than half an
hour had elapsed. Suddenly Dólokhov made a backward movement
with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously; this was sufficient to
cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge. As he
began slipping down, his head and arm wavered still more with the
strain. One hand moved as if to clutch the window sill, but refrained
from touch ing it. Pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would
never open  them again. Suddenly he was aware of a stir all around. He looked  up: Dólokhov was standing  on the window sill, with a
pale but radiant face. “It’s empty .”
He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly . Dólokhov jumped down. He smelt strongly of rum. “Well done!... Fine fellow!... There’ s a bet for you!... Devil take
you!” came from dif ferent sides. The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the
money . Dólokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped
upon the window sill. “Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I’ll do the same thing!”
he suddenly cried. “Even without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me
a bottle. I’ll do it.... Bring a bottle!”
“Let him do it, let him do it,” said Dólokhov , smiling. “What next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why , you go giddy even on a staircase,” exclaimed several voices. “I’ll drink it! Let’s have a bottle of rum!” shouted Pierre, banging
the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to
climb out of the window . They seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone
who touched him was sent flying.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

Prince Vasíli kept the promise he had given to Princess
Drubetskáya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Borís
on the evening of Anna Pávlovna’ s soiree. The matter was mentioned
to the Emperor , an exception made, and Borís transferred into the
regiment of Semënov Guards with the rank of cornet. He received,
however , no appointment to Kutúzov’ s staff despite all Anna
Mikháylovna’ s ende avors and entreaties. Soon after Anna Pávlovna’ s
reception Anna Mikháylovna returned to Moscow and went straight
to her rich relations, the Rostóvs, with whom she stayed when in the
town and where her darling Bóry , who had only just entered a
regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards
as a corne t, had been educated from childhood and lived for years at
a time. The Guard s had already left Petersbur g on the tenth of
August, and her son, who had remained in Moscow for his
equipment, was to join them on the march to Radzivílov . It was St. Natalia’ s day and the name day of two of the Rostóvs—
the mother and the youngest daughter—both named Nataly . Ever
since the morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and
going continually , bringing visitors to the Countess Rostóva’ s big
house on the Pova rskáya, so well known to all Moscow . The
countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the
drawing room with the visitors who came to congratulate, and who
constantly succeeded one another in relays. The countess was a woman of abou t forty-five, with a thin
Oriental type of face, evidently worn out with childbearing—she had
had twelve. A languor of motion and speech, resulting from
weakness, gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna Mikháylovna Drubetská ya, who as a member of the
household was also seated in the draw ing room, helped to receive
and entertain the visitors. The young people were in one of the inner
rooms, not considering it necessary to take part in receiving the
visitors.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"The count met the guests and saw them off, inviting them all
to dinner . “I am very, very grateful to you, mon cher,” or “ma chère”—he
called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation
in his tone, “my dear,” whether they were above or below him in
rank—“I thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose
name day we are keeping. But mind you come to dinner or I shall be
offended, ma chère! On behalf of the whole family I beg you to
come, mon cher! ” These words he repeated to everyo ne without
exception or variation, and with the same expression on his full,
cheerful, clean-shaven face, the same firm pressure of the hand and
the same quick, repeated bows. As soon  as he had seen a visitor off
he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing room, drew
a chair toward him or her, and jauntily spreading out his legs and
putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 44/174and knows how to live, he swayed to and fro with dignity , offered
surmises about the weather , or touched on questions of health,
sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but self-confident
French; then again, like a man weary but unflinching in the
fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking his
scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner . Sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass
through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining
hall, where tables were being set out for eighty people; and looking
at the footmen, who were bringing in silver and china, moving
tables, and unfolding damask table linen, he would call Dmítri
Vasílevich, a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs,
and while  looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say:
“Well, Dmítri, you’l l see that things are all as they should be? That’ s
right! The great thing is the serving, that’s it.” And with a
complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room. “Márya Lvóvna Karágina and her daughter!” announced the
countess’  gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing
room. The countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold
snuffbox with her husband’ s portrait on it. “I’m quite  worn out by these callers. However , I’ll see her and no
more. She is so affected. Ask her in,” she said to the footman in a sad
voice, as if saying: “V ery well, finish me of f.”
A tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced
smiling daughter , entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling. “Dear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child ... at the Razumóvski’ s ball ... and Coun tess Apráksina ... I was so
delighted...” came the sounds of animated feminine voices,
interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses
and the scraping of chairs. Then one of those conversations began
which last out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of
dresses and say, “I am so delighted... Mamma’ s health... and
Countess Apráksina...” and then, again rustling, pass into the
anteroom, put on cloaks or mantles, and drive away . The
conversation was on the chief topic of the day: the illness of the
wealthy and celebrated beau of Catherine’ s day, Count Bezúkhov ,
and about his illegi timate son Pierre, the one who had behaved so
improperly at Anna Pávlovna’ s reception. “I am so sorry for the poor count,” said the visitor . “He is in such
bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill
him!”
“What is that?” asked the countess as if she did not know what the
visitor alluded to, though she had alrea dy heard about the cause of
Count Bezúkhov’ s distress some fifteen times. “That’ s what comes of a modern educati on,” exclaimed the visitor . “It seems that while  he was abroad this young man was allowed to
do as he liked, now in Petersbur g I hear he has been doing such
terrible things that he has been expelled by the police.”
“You don’ t say so!” replied the countess. “He chose his friends badly ,” interp osed Anna Mikháylovna. “Prince Vasíli’ s son, he, and a certain Dólokhov have, it is said, been
up to heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 45/174Dólokhov has been degraded to the ranks and Bezúkhov’ s son sent
back to Moscow . Anatole Kurágin’ s father managed somehow to get
his son’s affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of
Petersbur g.”
“But what have they been up to?” asked the countess. “They are regular brigands, especially  Dólokhov ,” replied the
visitor . “He is a son of Márya Ivánovn a Dólokhova, such a worthy
woman, but there, just fancy! Those  three got hold of a bear
somewhere, put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some
actresses! The police tried to interfere, and what did the young men
do? They tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear
into the Moyka Canal. And there was the bear swimming about with
the policeman on his back!”
“What a nice figur e the policeman must have cut, my dear!”
shouted the count, dying with laughter . “Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?”
Yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing. “It was all they could do to rescue the poor man,” continued the
visitor . “And to think it is Cyril Vladím irovich Bezúkhov’ s son who
amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so
well educated and clever . This is all that his foreign education has
done for him! I hope  that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in
spite of his money . They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite
declined: I have my daughters to consider .”
“Why do you say this young man is so rich?” asked the countess,
turning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of
inattention. “His children are all illegit imate. I think Pierre also is
illegitimate.”
The visitor made a gesture with her hand. “I should think he has a score of them.”
Princess Anna Mikháylovna intervened in the conversation,
evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what
went on in society . “The fact of the matter is,” said she significantly , and also in a half
whisper , “everyone knows Count Cyril’ s reputation.... He has lost
count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.”
“How handsome the old man still was only a year ago!” remarked
the countess. “I have never seen a handsomer man.”
“He is very much altered now,” said Anna Mikháylovna. “Well, as
I was saying, Prince Vasíli is the next heir through his wife, but the
count is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to
the Emperor about him; so that in the case of his death—and he is so
ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from
Petersbur g—no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune,
Pierre or Prince Vasíli. Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I
know it all very well for Prince Vasíli told me himself. Besides, Cyril
Vladímirovich is my mother ’s second cousin. He’s also my Bóry’ s
godfather ,” she added, as if she attache d no importance at all to the
fact. “Prince Vasíli arrived in Moscow yester day. I hear he has come on
some inspection business,” remarked the visitor .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 46/174“Yes, but between ourselves,” said the princess, “that is a pretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril Vladímirovich, hearing
how ill he is.”
“But do you know , my dear, that was a capital joke,” said the
count; and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to
the young  ladies. “I can just imagine what a funny figure that
policeman cut!”
And as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his
portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one
who alwa ys eats well and, in particular , drinks well. “So do come
and dine with us!” he said.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 47/174CHAPTER XI
Silence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably ,
but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they
now rose and took their leave. The visitor ’s daughter was already
smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother ,
when sudd enly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys
and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and
a girl of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin
frock, darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room. It was
evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far. Behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat
collar , an officer of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-
faced boy in a short jacket. The count  jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his
arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in. “Ah, here she is!” he exclaimed laughing. “My pet, whose name
day it is. My dear pet!”
“Ma chère, there is a time for everything,” said the countess with
feigned severity . “You spoil her, Ilyá,” she added, turning to her
husband. “How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your
name day,” said the visitor . “What a charming child,” she added,
addressing the mother . This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life—
with childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook
her bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little
legs in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers—was just at that
charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not
yet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her
flushed face in the lace of her mother ’s mantilla—not paying the
least attention to her severe remark— and began to laugh. She
laughed, and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll
which she produced from the folds of her frock. “Do you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see...” was all Natásha
managed to utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned
against her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter
that even the prim visitor could not help joining in. “Now then, go away and take your monstrosity with you,” said the
mother , pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and
turning to the visitor she added: “She is my youngest girl.”
Natásha, raising her face for a moment from her mother ’s
mantilla, glanced up at her through tears of laughter , and again hid
her face. The visitor , compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it
necessary to take some part in it.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 48/174“Tell me, my dear,” said she to Natásha, “is Mimi a relation of
yours? A daughter , I suppose?”
Natásha did not like the visitor ’s tone of condescension to childish
things. She did not reply , but looked at her seriously . Meanwhile the younger generation: Borís, the officer, Anna
Mikháylovna’ s son; Nicholas, the unde rgraduate, the count’ s eldest
son; Sóny a, the count’ s fifteen-year -old niece, and little Pétya, his
youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were
obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the
excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces. Evidently in the
back rooms, from which they had dashed out so impetuously , the
conversation had been more amusing than the drawing room talk of
society scandals, the weather , and Countess Apráksina. Now and
then they glanced at one another , hardly able to suppress their
laughter . The two young men, the student and the officer, friends from
childhood, were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though
not alike. Borís was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face
had regula r, delicate features. Nicholas was short with curly hair and
an open expression. Dark hairs were already showing on his upper
lip, and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room. He evidently
tried to find something to say, but failed. Borís on the contrary at
once found his footing, and related quietly and humorously how he
had know n that doll Mimi when she was still quite a young lady,
before her nose was broken; how she had aged during the five years
he had known her, and how her head had cracked right across the
skull. Having said this he glanced at Natásha. She turned away from
him and glanced at her younger brother , who was screwing up his
eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter , and unable to control
herself any longer , she jumped up and rushed from the room as fast
as her nimble little feet would carry her . Borís did not laugh. “You were meaning to go out, weren’ t you, Mamma? Do you want
the carriage?” he asked his mother with a smile. “Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready ,” she answered,
returning his smile. Borís quietly left the room and went in search of Natásha. The
plump boy ran after them angrily , as if vexed that their program had
been disturbed.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not
counting the young lady visitor and the countess’  eldest daughter
(who was four years older than her sister and behaved already like a
grown-up person), were Nicholas and Sónya, the niece. Sónya was a
slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were
veiled by long lashe s, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head,
and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her
slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck. By the grace of her
movements, by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and by
a certain coyness and reserve of manner , she reminded one of a
pretty , half-grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful little
cat. She evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the
general conversation by smiling, but in spite of herself her eyes
under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to
join the army , with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile
could not for a single instant impose upon anyone, and it was clear
that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy
and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could, like
Natásha and Borís, escape from the drawing room. “Ah yes, my dear,” said the count, addressing the visitor and
pointing to Nicholas, “his friend Borís has become an officer, and so
for friendship’ s sake he is leaving the university and me, his old
father , and entering the military service, my dear. And there was a
place and everythin g waiting for him in the Archives Department! Isn’t that friendship?” remarked the count in an inquiring tone. “But they say that war has been declared,” replied the visitor . “They’ve been saying so a long while,” said the count, “and
they’ll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it. My dear,
there’ s friendship for you,” he repeated. “He’ s joining the hussars.”
The visitor , not knowing what to say , shook her head. “It’s not at all from friendship,” declared Nicholas, flaring up and
turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. “It is not from
friendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation.”
He glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were
both regarding him with a smile of approbation. “Schubert, the colonel of the Pávlograd  Hussars, is dining with us
today . He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with
him. It can’t be helped!” said the count,  shrugging his shoulders and
speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“I have already told you, Papa,” said his son, “that if you don’t
wish to let me go, I’ll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere except
in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.—I don’t
know how to hide what I feel.” As he spoke he kept glancing with
the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at Sónya and the young lady
visitor .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 50/174The little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any
moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature. “All right, all right !” said the old count.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“He always flares up! This Buon aparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he
rose from an ensign and became Emperor . Well, well, God grant it,”
he added, not noticing his visitor ’s sarcastic smile. The elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie Karágina turned
to young Rostóv . “What a pity you weren’t at the Arkháro vs’ on Thursday . It was so
dull without you,” said she, giving him a tender smile. The young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish
smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation
without at all notic ing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the
heart of Sónya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally . In the midst of
his talk he glanced round at her. She gave him a passionately angry
glance, and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial
smile on her lips, she got up and left the room. All Nicholas’
animation vanished. He waited for the first pause in the conversation,
and then with a distressed face left the room to find Sónya. “How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their
sleeves!” said Anna Mikháylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went
out. “Cousinage—danger eux voisinage,”  * she added. * Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood. “Yes,” said the coun tess when the brightness these young people
had brought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a
question no one had put but which was always in her mind, “and
how much suffering, how much anxiety one has had to go through
that we might rejoice in them now! And yet really the anxiety is
greater now than the joy. One is always, always anxious! Especially
just at this age, so dangerous both for girls and boys.”
“It all depends on the bringing up,” remarked the visitor . “Yes, you’re quite right,” continued the countess. “Till now I have
always, thank God, been my children ’s friend and had their full
confidence,” said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who
imagine that their children have no secrets from them. “I know I
shall always be my daughters’  first confidante, and that if Nicholas,
with his impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy can’t help
it), he will all the same never be like those Petersbur g young men.”
“Yes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters,” chimed in the
count, who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing
by deciding that everything was splendid. “Just fancy: wants to be an
hussar . What’ s one to do, my dear?”
“What a charming creature your younger girl is,” said the visitor;
“a little volcano!”
“Yes, a regular volcano,” said the count. “Takes after me! And
what a voice she has; though she’s my daughter , I tell the truth when
I say she’ll be a singer , a second Salomoni! We have engaged an
Italian to give her lessons.”
“Isn’ t she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to train
it at that age.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 51/174“Oh no, not at all too young!” replied the count. “Why , our
mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen.”
“And she’s in love with Borís already . Just fancy!” said the
countess with a gentle smile, looking at Borís and went on, evidently
concerned with a thought that always occupied her: “Now you see if
I were to be severe with her and to forbid it ... goodness knows what
they might be up to on the sly” (she meant that they would be
kissing), “but as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come
running to me of her own accord in the evening and tell me
everything. Perhaps I spoil her, but really that seems the best plan. With her elder sister I was stricter .”
“Yes, I was brought  up quite differently ,” remarked the handsome
elder daughter , Countess Véra, with a smile. But the smile did not enhance Véra’ s beauty as smiles generally
do; on the contra ry it gave her an unnatural, and therefore
unpleasant, expression. Véra was good-looking, not at all stupid,
quick at learning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice;
what she said was true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone
—the visitors and countess alike—turned to look at her as if
wondering why she had said it, and they all felt awkward. “People are always too clever with their eldest children and try to
make something exceptional of them,” said the visitor . “What’ s the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was
too clever with Véra,” said the count. “Well, what of that? She’s
turned out splendidly all the same,” he added, winking at Véra. The guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to
dinner . “What manners! I thought they would never go,” said the
countess, when she had seen her guests out.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

When Natásha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as
the conservatory . There she paused and stood listening to the
conversation in the drawing room, waiting for Borís to come out. She was already growing impatient, and stamped her foot, ready to
cry at his not coming at once, when she heard the young man’ s
discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly . At this
Natásha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid there. Borís paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a
little dust from the sleeve of his unifor m, and going up to a mirror
examined his handsome face. Natásha, very still, peered out from her
ambush, waiting to see what he would do. He stood a little while
before the glass, smiled, and walked toward the other door. Natásha
was about to call him but changed her mind. “Let him look for me,”
thought she. Hardly had Borís gone than Sónya, flushed, in tears, and
muttering angrily , came in at the other door. Natásha checked her
first impu lse to run out to her, and remained in her hiding place,
watching—as under  an invisible cap—to see what went on in the
world. She was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure. Sónya,
muttering to herself, kept looking round toward the drawing room
door. It opened and Nicholas came in. “Sónya, what is the matter with you? How can you?” said he,
running up to her . “It’s nothing, nothing; leave me alone!” sobbed Sónya. “Ah, I know what it is.”
“Well, if you do, so much the better , and you can go back to her!”
“Só-o-onya! Look here! How can you torture me and yourself like
that, for a mere fancy?” said Nicholas taking her hand. Sónya did not pull it away , and left off crying. Natásha, not
stirring and scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with
sparkling eyes. “What will happen now?” thought she. “Sónya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone are
everything!” said Nicholas. “And I will prove it to you.”
“I don’ t like you to talk like that.”
“Well, then, I won’ t; only forgive me, Sónya!” He drew her to him
and kissed her . “Oh, how nice,” thought Natásha; and when Sónya and Nicholas
had gone out of the conservatory she followed and called Borís to
her. “Borís, come here,” said she with a sly and significant look. “I
have something to tell you. Here, here!” and she led him into the
conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding. Borís followed her , smiling. “What is the something? ” asked he.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 53/174She grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had
thrown down on one of the tubs, picked it up. “Kiss the doll,” said she. Borís looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not
reply . “Don’ t you want to? Well, then, come here,” said she, and went
further in among the plants and threw down the doll. “Closer ,
closer!” she whispered. She caught the youn g officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity
and fear appeared on her flushed face. “And me? Would you like to kiss me?” she whispered almost
inaudibly , glancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, and
almost crying from excitement. Borís blushed. “How funny you are!” he said, bending  down to her and blushing
still more, but he waited and did nothing. Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced
him so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck,
and, tossing back her hair , kissed him full on the lips. Then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of
the tubs and stood, hanging her head. “Natásha,” he said, “you know that I love you, but....”
“You are in love with me?” Natásha broke in. “Yes, I am, but please don’t let us do like that.... In another four
years ... then I will ask for your hand.”
Natásha considered. “Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,” she counted on her slender
little fingers. “All right!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Then it’ s settled?”
A smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face. “Settled!” replied Borís. “Forever?” said the little girl. “T ill death itself?”
She took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the
adjoining sitting room.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

After receiving her visitors, the countess  was so tired that she gave
orders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to invite
to dinner all who came “to congratulate.” The countess wished to
have a tête-à-tête talk with the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna
Mikháylovna, whom  she had not seen properly since she returned
from Petersbur g. Anna Mikháylovna, with her tear-worn but pleasant
face, drew her chair nearer to that of the countess. “With you I will be quite frank,” said Anna Mikháylovna. “There
are not many left of us old friends! That’ s why I so value your
friendship.”
Anna Mikháylovna looked at Véra and paused. The countess
pressed her friend’ s hand. “Véra,” she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a
favorite, “how is it you have so little tact? Don’ t you see you are not
wanted here? Go to the other girls, or ...”
The hands ome Véra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all
hurt. “If you had told me sooner , Mamma, I would have gone,” she
replied as she rose to go to her own room. But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting,
one pair at each window . She stopped and smiled scornfully . Sónya
was sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for
her, the first he had ever written. Borís and Natásha were at the other
window and ceased talking when Véra entered. Sónya and Natásha
looked at Véra with guilty , happy faces. It was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love; but
apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in Véra. “How often have I asked you not to take my things?” she said. “You have  a room of your own,” and she took the inkstand from
Nicholas. “In a minute, in a minute,” he said, dipping his pen. “You always manage to do things at the wrong time,” continued
Véra. “You came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt
ashamed of you.”
Though what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason
no one replied, and the four simply looked at one another . She
lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand. “And at your age what secrets can there be between Natásha and
Borís, or between you two? It’ s all nonsense!”
“Now , Véra, what does it matter to you?” said Natásha in defense,
speaking very gently . She seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to
everyone. “Very silly ,” said Véra.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“I am ashamed of you. Secrets indeed!”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 55/174“All have secrets of their own,” answered Natásha, getting
warmer . “We don’ t interfere with you and Ber g.”
“I should think not,” said Véra, “because there can never be
anything wrong in my behavior . But I’ll just tell Mamma how you
are behaving with Borís.”
“Natálya Ilyníchna behaves very well to me,” remarked Borís. “I
have nothing to complain of.”
“Don’ t, Borís! You are such a diplomat  that it is really tiresome,”
said Natás ha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly . (She used
the word “diplomat,” which was just then much in vogue among the
children, in the special sense they attached to it.) “Why does she
bother me?” And she added, turnin g to Véra, “You’ll never
understand it, because you’ve never loved anyone. You have no
heart! You are a Madame de Genlis and nothing more” (this
nickname, bestowed on Véra by Nicholas, was considered very
stinging), “and your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people! Go and flirt with Ber g as much as you please,” she finished quickly . “I shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors...”
“Well, now you’ve done what you wanted,” put in Nicholas
—“said unpleasant things to everyone and upset them. Let’s go to the
nursery .”
All four , like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room. “The unpleasant things were said to me,” remarked Véra, “I said
none to anyone.”
“Madame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!” shouted laughing
voices through the door . The handsome Véra, who produced such an irritating and
unpleasant effect on everyone, smiled and, evidently unmoved by
what had been said to her, went to the looking glass and arranged her
hair and scarf. Looking at her own handsome face she seemed to
become still colder and calmer . In the drawing room the conversation was still going on. “Ah, my dear,” said the countess, “my life is not all roses either . Don’ t I know that at the rate we are living our means won’ t last
long? It’s all the Club and his easygoing nature. Even in the country
do we get any rest? Theatricals, hunting, and heaven knows what
besides! But don’t let’s talk about me; tell me how you managed
everything. I often wonder at you, Annette—how at your age you
can rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow , to Petersbur g, to those
ministers and great people, and know how to deal with them all! It’s
quite astonishing.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"How did you get thing s settled? I couldn’ t possibly
do it.”
“Ah, my love,” answered Anna Mikháylovna, “God grant you
never know what it is to be left a wido w without means and with a
son you love to distraction! One learns many things then,” she added
with a certain pride.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“That lawsuit taught me much. When I want to
see one of those big people I write a note: ‘Princess So-and-So
desires an interview with So and-So,’  and then I take a cab and go
myself two, three, or four times—till I get what I want. I don’t mind
what they think of me.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 56/174“Well, and to whom did you apply about Bóry?” asked the
countess. “You see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while
my Nicholas is going as a cadet. There’ s no one to interest himself
for him. To whom did you apply?”
“To Prince Vasíli. He was so kind. He at once agreed to
everything, and put the matter before the Emperor ,” said Princess
Anna Mikháylovna enthusiastically , quite forgetting all the
humiliation she had endured to gain her end. “Has Prince Vasíli aged much?” asked the countess. “I have not
seen him since we acted together at the Rumyántsovs’  theatricals. I
expect he has forgotten me. He paid me attentions in those days,”
said the countess, with a smile. “He is just the same as ever,” replied Anna Mikháylovna,
“overflowing with amiability . His position has not turned his head at
all. He said to me, ‘I am sorry I can do so little for you, dear
Princess. I am at your command.’  Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very
kind relati on. But, Nataly , you know my love for my son: I would do
anything for his happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way that
my positio n is now a terrible one,” continued Anna Mikháylovna,
sadly , dropping her voice. “My wretched lawsuit takes all I have and
makes no progress. Would you believe it, I have literally not a penny
and don’t know how to equip Borís.” She took out her handkerchief
and began to cry. “I need five hundred rubles, and have only one
twenty-five-ruble note. I am in such a state.... My only hope now is
in Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkh ov. If he will not assist his
godson—you know  he is Bóry’ s godfather—and allow him
something for his maintenance, all my trouble will have been thrown
away .... I shall not be able to equip him.”
The countess’  eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence. “I often think, though, perhaps it’s a sin,” said the princess, “that
here lives Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov so rich, all alone... that tremendous fortune...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"and what is his life worth? It’s a burden to
him, and Bóry’ s life is only just beginning....”
“Surely he will leave something to Borís,” said the countess. “Heaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish. Still, I will take Borís and go to see him at once, and I shall speak to
him straig ht out. Let people think what they will of me, it’s really all
the same to me when my son’s fate is at stake.” The princess rose. “It’s now two o’clock and you dine at four . There will just be time.”
And like a practical Petersbur g lady who knows how to make the
most of time, Anna Mikháylovna sent someone to call her son, and
went into the anteroom with him. “Good-by , my dear,” said she to the countess who saw her to the
door, and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, “Wish
me good luck.”
“Are you going to Count Cyril Vladímirovich, my dear?” said the
count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he
added: “If he is better , ask Pierre to dine with us. He has been to the
house, you know , and danced with the children.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Be sure to invite
him, my dear. We will see how Tarás distinguishes himself today . He
says Count Orlóv never gave such a dinner as ours will be!”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

“My dear Borís,” said Princess Anna Mikháylovna to her son as
Countess Rostóva’ s carriage in which they were seated drove over
the straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count
Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov’ s house. “My dear Borís,” said the
mother , drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it
timidly and tenderly on her son’s arm, “be affectionate and attentive
to him. Count Cyril Vladímirovich is your godfather after all, and
your futur e depends  on him. Remember  that, my dear, and be nice to
him, as you so well know how to be.”
“If only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of
it...” answered her son coldly . “But I have promised and will do it for
your sake.”
Although the hall porter saw someone’ s carriage standing at the
entrance, after scrut inizing the mother and son (who without asking
to be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between
the rows of statues in niches) and looki ng significantly at the lady’ s
old cloak, he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses,
and, heari ng that they wished to see the count, said his excellency
was worse today , and that his excellency was not receiving anyone. “We may as well go back,” said the son in French. “My dear!” exclaimed his mother imploringly , again laying her
hand on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him. Borís said no more,  but looked inquiringly at his mother without
taking of f his cloak. “My friend,” said Anna Mikháylovna in gentle tones, addressing
the hall porter , “I know Count Cyril Vladímirovich is very ill... that’s
why I have come..","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
". I am a relation. I shall not disturb him, my
friend... I only need  see Prince Vasíli Sergéevich: he is staying here,
is he not? Please announce me.”
The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and turned
away . “Princess Drubetskáya to see Prince Vasíli Sergéevich,” he called
to a footman dresse d in knee breeche s, shoes, and a swallow-tail
coat, who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing. The moth er smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a
large Venetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden-down shoes
briskly ascended the carpeted stairs. “My dear,” she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a
touch, “you promised me!”
The son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly . They entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to the
apartments assigned to Prince Vasíli. Just as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the hall,
were abou t to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 58/174up as they entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and
Prince Vasíli came out—wearing a velvet coat with a single star on
his breast, as was his custom when at home—taking leave of a good-
looking, dark-haired man. This was the celebrated Petersbur g doctor ,
Lorrain. “Then it is certain?” said the prince. “Prince, humanum est errar e, * but...” replied the doctor ,
swallowing his r’s, and pronouncing  the Latin words with a French
accent. * To err is human. “Very well, very well...”
Seeing Anna Mikháylovna and her son, Prince Vasíli dismissed the
doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of
inquiry . The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow
suddenly clouded his mother ’s face, and he smiled slightly . “Ah, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how
is our dear invalid?” said she, as though unaware of the cold
offensive look fixed on her . Prince Vasíli stared at her and at Borís questioningly and
perplexed. Borís bowed politely . Prince Vasíli without
acknowledging the bow turned to Anna Mikháylovna, answering her
query by a movement of the head and lips indicating very little hope
for the patient. “Is it possible?” exclaimed Anna Mikháylovna. “Oh, how awful!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"It is terrib le to think.... This is my son,” she added, indicating Borís. “He wanted to thank you himself.”
Borís bowed again politely . “Believe me, Prince, a mother ’s heart will never forget what you
have done for us.”
“I am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna
Mikháylovna,” said Prince Vasíli, arranging his lace frill, and in tone
and mann er, here in Moscow to Anna Mikháylovna whom he had
placed under an obligation, assuming an air of much greater
importance than he had done in Petersbur g at Anna Schérer ’s
reception. “Try to serve well and show yourself worthy ,” added he,
addressing Borís with severity . “I am glad.... Are you here on leave?”
he went on in his usual tone of indif ference. “I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency ,”
replied Borís, betraying neither annoyance at the prince’ s brusque
manner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so
quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance. “Are you living with your mother?”
“I am living at Countess Rostóva’ s,” replied Borís, again adding,
“your excellency .”
“That is, with Ilyá Rostóv who married Nataly Shinshiná,” said
Anna Mikháylovna. “I know, I know ,” answered Prince Vasíli in his monotonous voice. “I never could unde rstand how Nataly made up her mind to marry6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 59/174that unlicked bear! A perfectly absur d and stupid fellow , and a
gambler too, I am told.”
“But a very kind man, Prince,” said Anna Mikháylovna with a
pathetic smile, as though she too knew that Count Rostóv deserved
this censu re, but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man. “What do the doctors say?” asked the princess after a pause, her
worn face again expressing deep sorrow . “They give little hope,” replied the prince. “And I should so like to thank Uncle  once  for all his kindness to
me and Borís. He is his godson,” she added, her tone suggesting that
this fact ought to give Prince Vasíli much satisfaction. Prince Vasíli became thoughtful and frowned. Anna Mikháylovna
saw that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bezúkhov’ s
fortune, and hastened to reassure him. “If it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle ,”
said she, uttering the word with peculiar  assurance and unconcern, “I
know his character: noble, upright ... but you see he has no one with
him excep t the young princesses.... They  are still young....” She bent
her head and contin ued in a whisper: “Has he performed his final
duty, Prince? How priceless are those last moments! It can make
things no worse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is
so ill. We women, Prince,” and she smiled tenderly , “always know
how to say these things.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"I absolutely must see him, however painful
it may be for me. I am used to suf fering.”
Evidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he
had done at Anna Pávlovna’ s, that it would be difficult to get rid of
Anna Mikháylovna. “Would not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna
Mikháylovna?” said he. “Let us wait until evening. The doctors are
expecting a crisis.”
“But one cannot delay , Prince, at such a moment! Consider that
the welfar e of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a
Christian...”
A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the
princesses, the count’ s niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The
length of her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince Vasíli turned to her . “Well, how is he?”
“Still the same; but what can you expect, this noise...” said the
princess, looking at Anna Mikháylovna as at a stranger . “Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you,” said Anna Mikháylovna with a
happy smile, ambling lightly up to the count’ s niece. “I have come,
and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle . I imagine what
you have gone through,” and she sympathetically turned up her eyes. The princ ess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the
room as Anna Mikh áylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the
position she had conquered, settled down in an armchair , inviting
Prince Vasíli to take a seat beside her . “Borís,” she said to her son with a smile, “I shall go in to see the
count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 60/174and don’t forget to give him the Rostóvs ’ invitation. They ask him to
dinner . I suppose he won’ t go?” she continued, turning to the prince. “On the contrary ,” replied the prince, who had plainly become
depressed, “I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young
man....","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him.”
He shrugg ed his shoulders. A footman conducted Borís down one
flight of stairs and up another , to Pierre’ s rooms.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 61/174CHAPTER XVI
Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in
Petersbur g, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and
sent to Moscow . The story told about him at Count Rostóv’ s was
true. Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now
been for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his
father ’s house. Though he expected that the story of his escapade
would be already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his
father—who were never favorably disposed toward him—would
have used it to turn the count against him, he nevertheless on the day
of his arrival went to his father ’s part of the house. Entering the
drawing room, where the princesses spent most of their time, he
greeted the ladies, two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames
while a third read aloud. It was the eldest who was reading—the one
who had met Anna Mikháylovna. The two younger ones were
embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in
that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier . Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper . The eldest
princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with
frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely the same expression;
while the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and
lively disposition, bent over her fram e to hide a smile probably
evoked by the amus ing scene she foresa w. She drew her wool down
through the canvas and, scarcely able to refrain from laughing,
stooped as if trying to make out the pattern. “How do you do, cousin?” said Pierre. “Y ou don’ t recognize me?”
“I recognize you only too well, too well.”
“How is the count? Can I see him?” asked Pierre, awkwardly as
usual, but unabashed. “The count is suffering physically and mentally , and apparently
you have done your best to increase his mental suf ferings.”
“Can I see the count?” Pierre again asked. “Hm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see
him... Olga, go and see whether Uncle’ s beef tea is ready—it is
almost time,” she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were
busy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he,
Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance. Olga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed
and said: “Then I will go to my rooms. You will let me know when I
can see him.”
And he left the room , followed by the low but ringing laughter of
the sister with the mole. Next day Prince Vasíli had arrived and settled in the count’ s house. He sent for Pierre and said to him: “My dear fellow , if you are going
to behave here as you did in Petersbur g, you will end very badly; that6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 62/174is all I have to say to you. The count is very, very ill, and you must
not see him at all.”
Since then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole
time in his rooms upstairs. When Borís appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down
his room, stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing
gestures at the wall, as if running a sword through an invisible foe,
and glarin g savagely over his spectacles , and then again resuming his
walk, muttering indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and
gesticulating. “England is done for,” said he, scowling  and pointing his finger at
someone unseen. “Mr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the rights
of man, is sentence d to...” But before Pierre—who at that moment
imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just effected
the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured London
—could pronounce Pitt’s sentence, he saw a well-built and handsome
young officer entering his room. Pierre paused. He had left Moscow
when Borís was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him, but
in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took Borís by the hand with
a friendly smile. “Do you remember me?” asked Borís quietly with a pleasant
smile. “I have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he
is not well.”
“Yes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing him,”
answered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was. Borís felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it
necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least
embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face. “Count Rostóv asks you to come to dinner today ,” said he, after a
considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable. “Ah, Coun t Rostóv!” exclaimed Pierre joyfully . “Then you are his
son, Ilyá? Only fancy, I didn’ t know you at first. Do you remember
how we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... It’s such
an age...”
“You are mistaken ,” said Borís deliberately , with a bold and
slightly sarcastic smile. “I am Borís, son of Princess Anna
Mikháylovna Drube tskáya. Rostóv , the father , is Ilyá, and his son is
Nicholas. I never knew any Madame Jacquot.”
Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or
bees. “Oh dear, what am I thinking about?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
I’ve mixed everything up. One has so many relatives in Moscow! So you are Borís? Of course.,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Well, now we know where we are. And what do you think of the
Boulogne expedition? The English will come off badly , you know , if
Napoleon gets across the Channel. I think the expedition is quite
feasible. If only Villeneuve doesn’ t make a mess of things!”
Borís knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not
read the papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve’ s
name. “We here in Mosco w are more occupie d with dinner parties and
scandal than with politics,” said he in his quiet ironical tone.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“I know6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 63/174nothing about it and have not thought about it. Moscow is chiefly
busy with gossip,” he continued. “Just  now they are talking about
you and your father .”
Pierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his
companion’ s sake that the latter migh t say something he would
afterwards regret. But Borís spoke distinctly , clearly , and dryly ,
looking straight into Pierre’ s eyes. “Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip,” Borís went on. “Everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune,
though he may perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will...”
“Yes, it is all very horrid,” interrupted Pierre, “very horrid.”
Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say
something disconcerting to himself. “And it must seem to you,” said Borís  flushing slightly , but not
changing his tone or attitude, “it must seem to you that everyone is
trying to get something out of the rich man?”
“So it does,” thought Pierre. “But I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are
quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are very poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason
that your father is rich, I don’t regard myself as a relation of his, and
neither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him.”
For a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he
jumped up from the sofa, seized Borís under the elbow in his quick,
clumsy way, and, blushing far more than Borís, began to speak with
a feeling of mingled shame and vexation. “Well, this is strang e!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
Do you suppose  I...,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"who could think?... I
know very well...”
But Borís again interrupted him. “I am glad I have spoken out fully.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Perhaps you did not like it? You must excuse me,” said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being
put at ease by him, “but I hope I have  not offended you. I always
make it a rule to speak out...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Well, what answer am I to take? Will
you come to dinner at the Rostóvs’?”
And Borís , having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty
and extrica ted himself from an awkward situation and placed another
in it, became quite pleasant again. “No, but I say,” said Pierre, calming down, “you are a wonderful
fellow!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"What you have just said is good, very good. Of course you
don’t know me. We have not met for such a long time... not since we
were children. You might think that I...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"I understand, quite
understand. I could not have done it myself, I should not have had
the courag e, but it’s splendid. I am very glad to have made your
acquaintance. It’s queer ,” he added after a pause, “that you should
have suspected me!” He began to laugh. “Well, what of it! I hope
we’ll get better acquainted,” and he pressed Borís’  hand. “Do you
know , I have not once been in to see the count. He has not sent for
me.... I am sorry for him as a man, but what can one do?”
“And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?”
asked Borís with a smile.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 64/174Pierre saw that Borís wished to change  the subject, and being of
the same mind he began explaining the advantages and
disadvantages of the Boulogne expedition. A footman came in to summon Borís—the princess was going. Pierre, in order to make Borís’  better acquaintance, promised to
come to dinner , and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately
over his spectacles into Borís’  eyes. After he had gone Pierre
continued pacing up and down the room  for a long time, no longer
piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword, but smiling at
the remembrance of that pleasant, intelligent, and resolute young
man. As often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads a
lonely life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man
and made up his mind that they would be friends. Prince Vasíli saw the princess off. She held a handkerchief to her
eyes and her face was tearful. “It is dreadful, dreadful!” she was saying, “but cost me what it
may I shall do my duty. I will come and spend the night.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"

After Anna Mikháylovna had driven off with her son to visit
Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov , Countess Rostóva sat for a
long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. At last she
rang.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“What is the matter with you, my dear?” she said crossly to the
maid who kept her waiting some minutes. “Don’ t you wish to serve
me? Then I’ll find you another place.”
The count ess was upset by her friend’ s sorrow and humiliating
poverty , and was therefore out of sorts,  a state of mind which with
her always found expression in calling her maid “my dear” and
speaking to her with exaggerated politeness. “I am very sorry , ma’am,” answered the maid. “Ask the count to come to me.”
The count  came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty
look as usual. “Well, little countess? What a sauté  of game au madèr e we are to
have, my dear! I tasted it. The thousand rubles I paid for Tarás were
not ill-spent. He is worth it!”
He sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands
ruffling his gray hair . “What are your commands, little countess?”
“You see, my dear... What’ s that mess? ” she said, pointing to his
waistcoat. “It’s the sauté , most likely ,” she added with a smile. “Well, you see, Count, I want some money .”
Her face became sad. “Oh, little countess! ” ... and the count began bustling to get out his
pocketbook. “I want a great deal, Count! I want five hundred rubles,” and
taking out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband’ s
waistcoat. “Yes, immediately , immediately!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Hey, who’ s there?” he called out
in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call
will rush to obey the summons. “Send Dmítri to me!”
Dmítri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the
count’ s house and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into
the room. “This is what I want, my dear fellow ,” said the count to the
deferential young man who had entered . “Bring me...” he reflected a
moment, “yes, bring me seven hundred  rubles, yes! But mind, don’t
bring me such tattered and dirty notes  as last time, but nice clean
ones for the countess.”
“Yes, Dmítri, clean ones, please,” said the countess, sighing
deeply .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 66/174“When would you like them, your excellency?” asked Dmítri. “Allow me to inform you... But, don’t be uneasy ,” he added, noticing
that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which
was always a sign of approaching anger . “I was forgetting... Do you
wish it brought at once?”
“Yes, yes; just so! Bring it. Give it to the countess.”
“What a treasure that Dmítri is,” added the count with a smile
when the young man had departed. “There is never any ‘impossible’
with him. That’ s a thing I hate! Everything is possible.”
“Ah, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in the
world,” said the countess. “But I am in great need of this sum.”
“You, my little countess, are a notorious spendthrift,” said the
count, and having kissed his wife’ s hand he went back to his study . When Anna Mikhá ylovna returned from Count Bezúkhov’ s the
money , all in clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on
the countess’  little table, and Anna Mikháylovna noticed that
something was agitating her . “Well, my dear?” asked the countess. “Oh, what a terrible  state he is in! One would not know him, he is
so ill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word...”
“Annette, for heaven’ s sake don’t refuse me,” the countess began,
with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified, elderly
face, and she took the money from under the handkerchief. Anna Mikháylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to
be ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment. “This is for Borís from me, for his outfit.”
Anna Mikháylovna was already embracing her and weeping. The
countess wept too. They wept because they were friends, and
because they were kindhearted, and because they—friends from
childhood—had to think about such a base thing as money , and
because their youth was over.... But those tears were pleasant to them
both.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

Countess Rostóva, with her daughters and a large number of
guests, was already seated in the drawi ng room. The count took the
gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice collection of
Turkish pipes. From  time to time he went out to ask: “Hasn’ t she
come yet?” They were expecting Máry a Dmítrievna Akhrosímova,
known in society as le terrible dragon , a lady distinguishe d not for
wealth or rank, but for common sense and frank plainness of speech. Márya Dmítrievna was known to the Imperial family as well as to all
Moscow and Petersbur g, and both cities wondered at her, laughed
privately at her rudenesses, and told good stories about her, while
none the less all without exception respected and feared her . In the count’ s room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked
of the war that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the
recruiting. None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all
knew it had appeared. The count sat on the sofa between two guests
who were  smoking and talking. He neither smoked nor talked, but
bending his head first to one side and then to the other watched the
smokers with evident pleasure and listen ed to the conversation of his
two neighbors, whom he egged on against each other . One of them was a sallow , clean-shaven civilian with a thin and
wrinkled face, already growing old, though he was dressed like a
most fashionable young man. He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if
quite at home and, having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his
mouth, was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his
eyes. This was an old bachelor , Shinshín, a cousin of the countess’, a
man with “a sharp tongue” as they said in Moscow society . He
seemed to be condescending to his companion. The latter , a fresh,
rosy officer of the Guards, irreproachably washed, brushed, and
buttoned, held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips
gently inhaled the smoke, letting it escape from his handsome mouth
in rings. This was Lieutenant Berg, an officer in the Semënov
regiment with whom  Borís was to travel to join the army , and about
whom Natásha had teased her elder sister Véra, speaking of Berg as
her “intended.” The count sat between them and listened attentively . His favorite occupation when not playing boston, a card game he
was very fond of, was that of listener , especially when he succeeded
in setting two loquacious talkers at one another . “Well, then, old chap, mon très honorable  Alphonse Kárlovich,”
said Shinshín, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary
Russian expressions with the choicest French phrases—which was a
peculiarity of his speech. “Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur
l’état ; * you want to make something out of your company?”
* You expect to make an income out of the government. “No, Peter  Nikoláev ich; I only want to show that in the cavalry the
advantages are far less than in the infantry. Just consider my own6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 68/174position now , Peter Nikoláevich...”
Berg always spoke quietly , politely , and with great precision. His
conversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain
calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct
bearing on himself. He could remain silent for hours without being at
all put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable,
but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to
talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction. “Consider my position, Peter Nikoláevich. Were I in the cavalry I
should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months,
even with the rank of lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred
and thirty,” said he, looking at Shinshín and the count with a joyful,
pleasant smile, as if it were obvious to him that his success must
always be the chief desire of everyone else. “Besides that, Peter Nikoláevich, by exchanging into the Guards I
shall be in a more prominent position,” continued Berg, “and
vacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards. Then just
think what can be done with two hund red and thirty rubles! I even
manage to put a little aside and to send something to my father ,” he
went on, emitting a smoke ring. “La balance y est... * A German know s how to skin a flint, as the
proverb says,” remarked Shinshín, moving his pipe to the other side
of his mouth and winking at the count. * So that squares matters. The count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing that
Shinshín was talking came up to listen. Berg, oblivious of irony or
indifference, continued to explain how by exchanging into the
Guards he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the
Cadet Corps; how in wartime the company commander might get
killed and he, as senior in the company , might easily succeed to the
post; how popular he was with everyone in the regiment, and how
satisfied his father was with him. Berg evidently enjoyed narrating
all this, and did not seem to suspect that others, too, might have their
own intere sts. But all he said was so prettily sedate, and the naïveté
of his youthful egotism was so obvious, that he disarmed his hearers. “Well, my boy, you’ll get along wherever you go—foot or horse—
that I’ll warrant,” said Shinshín, patting him on the shoulder and
taking his feet of f the sofa. Berg smiled joyously . The count, follow ed by his guests, went into
the drawing room. It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled
guests, expecting the summons to zakúska , * avoid engaging in any
long conv ersation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in
order to show that they are not at all impatient for their food. The
host and hostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at
one another , and the visitors try to guess from these glances who, or
what, they are waiting for—some impor tant relation who has not yet
arrived, or a dish that is not yet ready . * Hors d’oeuvres.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 69/174Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in
the middl e of the drawing room on the first chair he had come
across, blocking the way for everyone. The countess tried to make
him talk, but he went on naïvely looking around through his
spectacles as if in search of somebody and answered all her
questions in monosyllables. He was in the way and was the only one
who did not notice the fact. Most of the guests, knowing of the affair
with the bear, looked with curiosity at this big, stout, quiet man,
wondering how such a clumsy , modes t fellow could have played
such a prank on a policeman. “You have only lately arrived?” the countess asked him. “Oui, madame,”  replied he, looking around him. “You have not yet seen my husband?”
“Non, madame.”  He smiled quite inappropriately . “You have  been in Paris recently , I believe? I suppose it’s very
interesting.”
“Very interesting.”
The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikháylovna. The
latter understood that she was being asked to entertain this young
man, and sitting down beside him she began to speak about his
father; but he answered her, as he had the countess, only in
monosyllables. The other guests were all conversing with one
another . “The Razumóvskis... It was charming... You are very kind... Countess Apráksina. ..” was heard on all sides. The countess rose and
went into the ballroom. “Márya Dmítrievna?” came her voice from there. “Herself,” came the answer in a rough voice, and Márya
Dmítrievna entered the room. All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the
very oldest rose. Márya Dmítrievna paused at the door. Tall and
stout, holding high her fifty-year -old head with its gray curls, she
stood surveying the guests, and leisurel y arranged her wide sleeves
as if rolling them up. Márya Dmítrievna always spoke in Russian. “Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and
to her children,” she said, in her loud, full-toned voice which
drowned all others. “Well, you old sinner,” she went on, turning to
the count who was kissing her hand, “you’re feeling dull in Moscow ,
I daresay? Nowhere to hunt with your dogs?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"But what is to be done,
old man? Just see how these nestlings are growing up,” and she
pointed to the girls. “You must look for husbands for them whether
you like it or not....”
“Well,” said she, “how’ s my Cossack?” (Márya Dmítrievna
always called Natásha a Cossack) and she stroked the child’ s arm as
she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand. “I know she’s a scamp
of a girl, but I like her .”
She took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge
reticule and, having given them to the rosy Natásha, who beamed
with the pleasure of her saint’ s-day fete, turned away at once and
addressed herself to Pierre. “Eh, eh, friend!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Come here a bit,” said she, assuming a soft high
tone of voice. “Come here, my friend...” and she ominously tucked6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 70/174up her sleeves still higher . Pierre approached, looking at her in a
childlike way through his spectacles. “Come nearer , come nearer , friend! I used to be the only one to tell
your fathe r the truth when he was in favor, and in your case it’s my
evident duty.” She paused. All were silent, expectant of what was to
follow , for this was clearly only a prelude. “A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathbed
and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame,
sir, for shame! It would be better if you went to the war .”
She turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly
keep from laughing. “Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?” said Márya
Dmítrievna. The count went in first with Márya Dmítrievna, the countess
followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to
them because Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then
came Anna Mikháylovna with Shinshín. Berg gave his arm to Véra. The smiling Julie Karágina went in with Nicholas. After them other
couples followed, filling the whole dining hall, and last of all the
children, tutors, and governesses followed singly . The footmen began
moving about, chairs scraped, the band struck up in the gallery , and
the guests settled down in their places. Then the strains of the count’ s
household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks, the
voices of visitors, and the soft steps of the footmen. At one end of the
table sat the countes s with Márya Dmítrievna on her right and Anna
Mikháylovna on her left, the other lady visitors were farther down. At the other end sat the count, with the hussar colonel on his left and
Shinshín and the other male visitors on his right. Midway down the
long table  on one side sat the grown-up young people: Véra beside
Berg, and Pierre beside Borís; and on the other side, the children,
tutors, and governesses. From behind the crystal decanters and fruit
vases, the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its
light-blue ribbons, and busily filled his neighbors’  glasses, not
neglecting his own. The countess in turn, without omitting her duties
as hostess, threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at
her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to
contrast more than usual with his gray hair. At the ladies’  end an
even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at the men’ s end the
voices sounded louder and louder , especially that of the colonel of
hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so much
that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests. Berg with
tender smiles was saying to Véra that love is not an earthly but a
heavenly feeling. Borís was telling his new friend Pierre who the
guests were and exchanging glances with Natásha, who was sitting
opposite. Pierre spoke little but examin ed the new faces, and ate a
great deal. Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and
went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the
wines. These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped
in a napkin, from behind the next man’s shoulders and whispered:
“Dry Madeira”... “Hungarian”... or “Rhine wine” as the case might
be. Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count’ s monogram
that stood before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank
with enjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 71/174guests. Natásha, who sat opposite, was looking at Borís as girls of
thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for
the first time. Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that
funny lively little girl’s look made him inclined to laugh without
knowing why . Nicholas sat at some distance from Sónya, beside Julie Karágina,
to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. Sónya wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by
jealousy; now she turned pale, now blushed and strained every nerve
to overhea r what Nicholas and Julie were saying to one another . The
governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any
slight that might be put upon the child ren. The German tutor was
trying to remember  all the dishes, wines, and kinds of dessert, in
order to send a full description of the dinner to his people in
Germany; and he felt greatly offended when the butler with a bottle
wrapped in a napkin passed him by. He frowned, trying to appear as
if he did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because no one
would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from
greediness that he wanted it, but simply from a conscientious desire
for knowledge.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 72/174CHAPTER XIX
At the men’ s end of the table the talk grew more and more
animated. The colonel told them that the declaration of war had
already appeared in Petersbur g and that a copy , which he had himself
seen, had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in
chief. “And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?” remarked
Shinshín. “He has stopped Austria’ s cackle and I fear it will be our
turn next.”
The colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted
to the service and patriotically Russian. He resented Shinshín’ s
remark. “It is for the reasson, my goot sir,” said he, speaking with a
German accent, “for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat. He
declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze
danger vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire
as vell as ze sanctity of its alliances ...” he spoke this last word with
particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter . Then with the unerring official memory  that characterized him he
repeated from the opening words of the manifesto:
... and the wish, which  constitutes the Emperor’s sole and absolute
aim—to establish peace in Europe on firm foundations—has now
decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new
condition for the attainment of that purpose . “Zat, my dear sir, is vy...” he conclud ed, drinking a tumbler of
wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval. “Connaissez-vous le Proverbe: * ‘Jerome, Jerome, do not roam,
but turn spindles at home!’?” said Shinshín, puckering his brows and
smiling. “Cela nous convient à merveille .*(2) Suvórov now—he
knew what he was about; yet they beat him à plate couture,*(3) and
where are we to find Suvórovs now? Je vous demande un peu,” *(4)
said he, continually changing from French to Russian. * Do you know the proverb?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"*(2) That suits us down to the ground. *(3) Hollow. *(4) I just ask you that. “Ve must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood!” said the colonel,
thumping the table; “and ve must tie for our Emperor , and zen all vill
pe vell. And ve must discuss it as little as po-o-ossible”... he dwelt
particularly on the word possible ... “as po-o-ossible,” he ended,
again turning to the count. “Zat is how ve old hussars look at it, and
zere’ s an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a young
hussar , how do you judge of it?” he added, addressing Nicholas, who6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 73/174when he heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his
partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel. “I am quite of your opinion,” replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning
his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much
decision and desperation as though he were at that moment facing
some great danger . “I am convinced that we Russians must die or
conquer ,” he concluded, conscious—as were others—after the words
were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for
the occasion and were therefore awkward. “What you said just now was splendid!” said his partner Julie. Sónya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them
and down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking. Pierre listened to the colonel’ s speech and nodded approvingly . “That’ s fine,” said he. “The young man’ s a real hussar!” shouted the colonel, again
thumping the table. “What are you making such a noise about over there?” Márya
Dmítrievna’ s deep voice suddenly inqui red from the other end of the
table. “What are you thumping the table for?” she demanded of the
hussar , “and why are you exciting yourself? Do you think the French
are here?”
“I am speaking ze truce,” replied the hussar with a smile. “It’s all about the war,” the count shouted down the table. “You
know my son’ s going, Márya Dmítrievna? My son is going.”
“I have four sons in the army but still I don’t fret. It is all in God’ s
hands. You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a battle,”
replied Márya Dmítrievna’ s deep voice, which easily carried the
whole length of the table. “That’ s true!”
Once more the conversations concentra ted, the ladies’  at the one
end and the men’ s at the other . “You won’t ask,” Natásha’ s little brothe r was saying; “I know you
won’ t ask!”
“I will,” replied Natásha. Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. She half rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen
to what was coming, and turning to her mother:
“Mamma!” rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice,
audible the whole length of the table. “What is it?” asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her
daughter ’s face that it was only mischi ef, she shook a finger at her
sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head. The conversation was hushed.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?” and Natásha’ s
voice sounded still more firm and resolute. The countess tried to frown, but could not. Márya Dmítrievna
shook her fat finger . “Cossack!” she said threateningly .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 74/174Most of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at
the elders. “You had better take care!” said the countess.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?” Natásha again
cried boldly , with saucy gaiety , confident that her prank would be
taken in good part. Sónya and fat little Pétya doubled up with laughter . “You see! I have  asked,” whispered Natásha to her little brother
and to Pierre, glancing at him again. “Ice pudding, but you won’ t get any ,” said Márya Dmítrievna. Natásha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved
even Márya Dmítrievna. “Márya Dmítrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I don’t like ice
cream.”
“Carrot ices.”
“No! What kind, Márya Dmítrievna? What kind?” she almost
screamed; “I want to know!”
Márya Dmítrievna and the countess burst out laughing, and all the
guests joined in. Everyone laughed, not at Márya Dmítrievna’ s
answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl
who had dared to treat Márya Dmítrievna in this fashion. Natásha only desisted when she had been told that there would be
pineapple ice. Before the ices, champagne was served round. The
band again  struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests,
leaving their seats, went up to “congratulate” the countess, and
reached across the table to clink glass es with the count, with the
children, and with one another . Again the footmen rushed about,
chairs scraped, and in the same order in which they had entered but
with redder faces, the guests returned to the drawing room and to the
count’ s study .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

The card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and the
count’ s visitors settled themselves, some in the two drawing rooms,
some in the sitting room, some in the library . The count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty
from dropping into his usual after-dinner nap, and laughed at
everything. The young people, at the countess’  instigation, gathered
round the clavichord  and harp. Julie by general request played first. After she had played a little air with variations on the harp, she
joined the other young ladies in begging Natásha and Nicholas, who
were noted  for their musical talent, to sing something. Natásha, who
was treate d as though she were grown up, was evidently very proud
of this but at the same time felt shy . “What shall we sing?” she said. “‘The Brook,’” suggested Nicholas. “Well, then, let’s be quick. Borís, come here,” said Natásha. “But
where is Sónya?”
She looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room
ran to look for her . Running into Sónya’ s room and not finding her there, Natásha ran
to the nursery , but Sónya was not there either . Natásha concluded
that she must be on the chest in the passage. The chest in the passage
was the place of mourning for the youn ger female generation in the
Rostóv household. And there in fact was Sónya lying face downward
on Nurse’ s dirty feather bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her
gauzy pink dress under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers,
and sobbi ng so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook. Natásha’ s face, which had been so radiantly happy all that saint’ s
day, sudde nly changed: her eyes becam e fixed, and then a shiver
passed down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth drooped. “Sónya! What is it?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
What is the matter?... Oo...,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Oo... Oo...!” And
Natásha’ s large mouth widened, making  her look quite ugly, and she
began to wail like a baby without knowing why, except that Sónya
was crying. Sónya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and
hid her face still deeper in the bed. Natásha wept, sitting on the blue-
striped feather bed and hugging her friend. With an effort Sónya sat
up and began wiping her eyes and explaining. “Nicholas is going away in a week’ s time, his... papers...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"have
come...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"he told me himself... but still I should not cry,” and she
showed a paper she held in her hand—with the verses Nicholas had
written, “still, I should not cry, but you can’t... no one can
understand... what a soul he has!”
And she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul. “It’s all very well for you... I am not envious... I love you and
Borís also,” she went on, gaining a little strength; “he is nice... there

"and even then it can’t be
done. And besides, if she tells Mamm a” (Sónya looked upon the
countess as her mother and called her so) “that I am spoiling
Nicholas’  career and am heartless and ungrateful, while truly... God
is my witness,” and she made the sign of the cross, “I love her so
much, and all of you, only Véra... And what for? What have I done to
her? I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice
everything, only I have nothing....”
Sónya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and
in the feather bed. Natásha began consoling her, but her face showed
that she understood all the gravity of her friend’ s trouble. “Sónya,” she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true
reason of her friend’ s sorrow , “I’m sure Véra has said something to
you since dinner? Hasn’ t she?”
“Yes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some
others, and she found them on my table and said she’d show them to
Mamma, and that I was ungrateful, and that Mamma would never
allow him to marry me, but that he’ll marry Julie. You see how he’s
been with her all day ... Natásha, what have I done to deserve it?...”
And again  she began to sob, more bitterly than before. Natásha
lifted her up, hugg ed her, and, smiling through her tears, began
comforting her . “Sónya, don’t believe her, darling! Don’ t believe her! Do you
remember how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting
room after supper? Why , we settled how everything was to be. I
don’t quite  remember how, but don’t you remember that it could all
be arranged and how nice it all was? There’ s Uncle Shinshín’ s
brother has married his first cousin. And we are only second cousins,
you know. And Borís says it is quite possible. You know I have told
him all about it. And he is so clever and so good!” said Natásha. “Don’ t you cry, Sónya, dear love, darling Sónya!” and she kissed her
and laugh ed. “Véra’ s spiteful; never mind her! And all will come
right and she won’ t say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her
himself, and he doesn’ t care at all for Julie.”
Natásha kissed her on the hair . Sónya sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it
seemed ready to lift its tail, jump down  on its soft paws, and begin
playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should. “Do you think so?...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Really? Truly?” she said, quickly smoothing
her frock and hair . “Really , truly!” answered Natásha, pushing in a crisp lock that had
strayed from under her friend’ s plaits. Both laughed. “Well, let’ s go and sing ‘The Brook.’”
“Come along!”
“Do you know , that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!”
said Natásha, stopping suddenly . “I feel so happy!”
And she set of f at a run along the passage. Sónya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking
away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little
chest, ran after Natásha down the passa ge into the sitting room with6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 77/174flushed face and light, joyous steps. At the visitors’  request the young
people sang the quartette, “The Brook ,” with which everyone was
delighted. Then Nicholas sang a song he had just learned:
At nighttime in the moon’s fair glow
    How sweet, as fancies wander free,
To feel that in this world there’s one
    Who still is thinking but of thee! That while her fingers touch the harp
    Wafting sweet music o’er the lea,
It is for thee thus swells her heart,
    Sighing its message out to thee... A day or two, then bliss unspoilt,
    But oh!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"till then I cannot live!... He had not finished the last verse before the young people began
to get ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and
the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery . Pierre was sitting in the drawing room where Shinshín had
engaged him, as a man recently returned from abroad, in a political
conversation in which several others joined but which bored Pierre. When the music began Natásha came in and walking straight up to
Pierre said, laughing and blushing:
“Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers.”
“I am afraid of mixing the figures,” Pierre replied; “but if you will
be my teacher ...” And lowering his big arm he offered it to the
slender little girl. While the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians
tuning up, Pierre sat down with his little partner . Natásha was
perfectly happy; she was dancing with a grown-up  man, who had
been abroad. She was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to
him like a grown-up lady. She had a fan in her hand that one of the
ladies had given her to hold. Assuming quite the pose of a society
woman (heaven knows when and where she had learned it) she
talked with her partner , fanning herself and smiling over the fan. “Dear , dear! Just look at her!” exclaimed the countess as she
crossed the ballroom, pointing to Natásha. Natásha blushed and laughed. “Well, really , Mamma!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Why should you? What is there to be
surprised at?”
In the midst of the third écossaise  there was a clatter of chairs
being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and Márya
Dmítrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the more
distinguished and older visitors. They now, stretching themselves
after sittin g so long, and replacing their purses and pocketbooks,
entered the ballroom. First came Máry a Dmítrievna and the count,
both with merry countenances. The count, with playful ceremony
somewhat in ballet style, offered his bent arm to Márya Dmítrievna. He drew himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 78/174as soon as the last figure of the écossaise  was ended, he clapped his
hands to the musicia ns and shouted up to their gallery , addressing the
first violin:
“Semën! Do you know the Daniel Cooper? ”
This was the count’ s favorite dance, which he had danced in his
youth. (Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper  was one figure of the
anglaise .)
“Look at Papa!” shouted Natásha to the whole company , and quite
forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her
curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her
laughter . And indee d everybo dy in the room looked with a smile of pleasure
at the jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout
partner , Márya Dmítrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened
his shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped  gently with his foot, and, by
a smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared the
onlookers for what was to follow . As soon as the provocatively gay
strains of Daniel Cooper  (somewhat resembling those of a merry
peasant dance) began to sound, all the doorways of the ballroom
were sudd enly filled by the domestic serfs—the men on one side and
the women on the other—who with beaming faces had come to see
their master making merry . “Just look at the master! A regular eagle he is!” loudly remarked
the nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways. The count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and
did not want to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her
powerful arms hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the
countess), and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the
dance. What was expressed by the whole of the count’ s plump figure,
in Márya Dmítrievna found expression  only in her more and more
beaming face and quivering nose. But if the count, getting more and
more into the swing of it, charmed the spectators by the
unexpectedness of his adroit maneuver s and the agility with which
he capered about on his light feet, Márya Dmítrievna produced no
less impression by slight exertions—the least effort to move her
shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp her foot—which
everyone appreciate d in view of her size and habitual severity . The
dance grew livelier and livelier . The other couples could not attract a
moment’ s attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do
so. All were watchin g the count and Márya Dmítrievna. Natásha kept
pulling everyone by sleeve or dress, urging them to “look at Papa!”
though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple. In the
intervals of the dance the count, breathing deeply , waved and
shouted to the musicians to play faster . Faster , faster , and faster;
lightly , more lightly , and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying
round Márya Dmítrievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; until,
turning his partner round to her seat, he executed the final pas,
raising his soft foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling
and making a wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause
and laugh ter led by Natásha. Both partners stood still, breathing
heavily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

While in the Rostóvs’  ballroom the sixth anglaise  was being
danced, to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while
tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper , Count Bezúkhov
had a sixth stroke. The doctors pronounced recovery impossible. After a mute confes sion, communion was administered to the dying
man, preparations made for the sacram ent of unction, and in his
house there was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such
moments. Outside the house, beyond the gates, a group of
undertakers, who hid whenever a carriage drove up, waited in
expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral. The
Military Governor of Moscow , who had been assiduous in sending
aides-de-camp to inquire after the coun t’s health, came himself that
evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of Catherine’ s
court, Count Bezúkhov . The magnificent reception room was crowded. Everyone stood up
respectfully when the Military Governor , having stayed about half an
hour alone  with the dying man, passed  out, slightly acknowledging
their bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the
glances fixed on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the
family . Prince Vasíli, who had grown thinner and paler during the
last few days, escor ted him to the door, repeating something to him
several times in low tones. When the Military Governor had gone, Prince Vasíli sat down all
alone on a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the other ,
leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand. After sitting so for a while he rose, and, looking about him with
frightened eyes, went with unusually hurried steps down the long
corridor leading to the back of the house, to the room of the eldest
princess. Those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous
whispers, and, whenever anyone went into or came from the dying
man’ s room, grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or
expectancy at his door , which creaked slightly when opened. “The limit s of human life ... are fixed and may not be o’erpassed,”
said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was
listening naïvely to his words. “I wonder , is it not too late to administer unction?” asked the lady,
adding the priest’ s clerical title, as if she had no opinion of her own
on the subject. “Ah, madam, it is a great sacrament,” replied the priest, passing
his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across
his bald head. “Who was that?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"The Military Governor himself?” was being asked
at the other side of the room. “How young-looking he is!”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 81/174“Yes, and he is over sixty . I hear the count no longer recognizes
anyone. They wished to administer the sacrament of unction.”
“I knew someone who received that sacrament seven times.”
The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her
eyes red from weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was
sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his
elbow on a table. “Beautiful,” said the doctor in answe r to a remark about the
weather . “The weather is beautiful, Princ ess; and besides, in Moscow
one feels as if one were in the country .”
“Yes, indeed,” replied the princess with a sigh. “So he may have
something to drink?”
Lorrain considered. “Has he taken his medicine?”
“Yes.”
The doctor glanced at his watch. “Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar ,”
and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch. “Dere has neffer been a gase,” a German doctor was saying to an
aide-de-camp, “dat one lif fs after de sird stroke.”
“And what a well-preserved man he was!” remarked the aide-de-
camp. “And who will inherit his wealth?” he added in a whisper .","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“It von’ t go begging,” replied the German with a smile. Everyone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the
second princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to
Lorrain’ s instructions. The German doctor went up to Lorrain. “Do you think he can last till morning?” asked the German,
addressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly . Lorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severely negative finger
before his nose. “Tonight, not later,” said he in a low voice, and he moved away
with a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to
understand and state the patient’ s condition. Meanwhile Prince Vasíli had opened the door into the princess’
room. In this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning
before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt
pastilles. The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture,
whatnots, cupboards, and little tables. The quilt of a high, white
feather bed was just visible behind a screen. A small dog began to
bark. “Ah, is it you, cousin?”
She rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely
smooth that it seem ed to be made of one piece with her head and
covered with varnish. “Has anything happened?” she asked.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“I am so terrified.”
“No, there  is no change. I only came to have a talk about business,
Catiche,” * muttered the prince, seating  himself wearily on the chair6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 82/174she had just vacated . “You have made the place warm, I must say,”
he remarked. “W ell, sit down: let’ s have a talk.”
* Catherine. “I thought  perhaps something had happened,” she said with her
unchanging stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the
prince, she prepared to listen. “I wished to get a nap, mon cousin , but I can’ t.”
“Well, my dear?” said Prince Vasíli, taking her hand and bending
it downwards as was his habit. It was plain that this “well?” referred to much that they both
understood without naming. The princess, who had a straight, rigid body , abnormally long for
her legs, looked directly at Prince Vasíli with no sign of emotion in
her prominent gray eyes. Then she shoo k her head and glanced up at
the icons with a sigh. This might have been taken as an expression of
sorrow and devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting before
long. Prince Vasíli understood it as an expression of weariness. “And I?” he said; “do you think it is easier for me? I am as worn
out as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a
very serious talk.”
Prince Vasíli said no more and his cheeks began to twitch
nervously , now on one side, now on the other , giving his face an
unpleasant expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing
room. His eyes too seemed strange; at one moment they looked
impudently sly and at the next glanced round in alarm. The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony
hands, looked attentively into Prince Vasíli’ s eyes evidently resolved
not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till morning. “Well, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine
Semënovna,” conti nued Prince Vasíli, returning to his theme,
apparently not without an inner struggl e; “at such a moment as this
one must think of everything. One must think of the future, of all of
you... I love you all, like children of my own, as you know .”
The princess continued to look at him without moving, and with
the same dull expression. “And then of course  my family has also to be considered,” Prince
Vasíli went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at
her. “You know , Catiche, that we—you three sisters, Mámontov , and
my wife—are the count’ s only direct heirs. I know , I know how hard
it is for you to talk or think of such matters.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"It is no easier for me;
but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for
anything. Do you know I have sent for Pierre? The count,” pointing
to his portrait, “definitely demanded that he should be called.”
Prince Vasíli looked questioningly at the princess, but could not
make out whether she was considerin g what he had just said or
whether she was simply looking at him. “There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousi n,”
she replied, “and it is that He would be merciful to him and would
allow his noble soul peacefully to leave this...”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 83/174“Yes, yes, of course,” interrupted Prince Vasíli impatiently ,
rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little
table that he had pushed away . “But...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"in short, the fact is... you know
yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his
property , not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre.”
“He has made wills enough!” quietly remarked the princess. “But
he cannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate.”
“But, my dear,” said Prince Vasíli suddenly , clutching the little
table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: “what
if a letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for
Pierre’ s legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of the
count’ s services, his request would be granted?...”
The princess smiled as people do who think they know more about
the subject under discussion than those they are talking with. “I can tell you more,” continued Prince Vasíli, seizing her hand,
“that letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor
knew of it. The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not,
then as soon as all is over,” and Prince Vasíli sighed to intimate what
he meant by the words all is over, “and the count’ s papers are
opened, the will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor , and the
petition will certainly be granted. Pierr e will get everything as the
legitimate son.”
“And our share?” asked the princess  smiling ironically , as if
anything might happen, only not that. “But, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be
the legal heir to everything and you won’t get anything. You must
know , my dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether
they have been destroyed or not. And if they have somehow been
overlooked, you ought to know where they are, and must find them,
because...”
“What next?” the princess interrupted,  smiling sardonically and
not chang ing the expression of her eyes. “I am a woman, and you
think we are all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot
inherit... un bâtar d!”* she added, as if supposing that this translation
of the word would effectively prove to Prince Vasíli the invalidity of
his contention. * A bastard. “Well, really , Catiche!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Can’ t you understand! You are so
intelligent, how is it you don’t see that if the count has written a
letter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it
follows that Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count
Bezúkhov , and will then inherit everything under the will? And if the
will and letter are not destroyed, then you will have nothing but the
consolation of having been dutiful et tout ce qui s’ens uit!* That’s
certain.”
* And all that follows therefrom. “I know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid; and
you, mon cousin , seem to consider  me a perfect fool,” said the6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 84/174princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they
are saying something witty and stinging. “My dear Princess Catherine Semënov na,” began Prince Vasíli
impatiently , “I came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about
your intere sts as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation. And I
tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the
will in Pierre’ s favor are among the count’ s papers, then, my dear
girl, you and your sisters are not heiresses! If you don’t believe me,
then believe an expe rt. I have just been talking to Dmítri Onúfrich”
(the family solicitor) “and he says the same.”
At this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess’  ideas;
her thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her
voice when she began to speak passed through such transitions as
she herself evidently did not expect. “That would be a fine thing!” said she.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“I never wanted anything
and I don’ t now .”
She pushed the little dog of f her lap and smoothed her dress. “And this is gratitude—this is recognition for those who have
sacrificed everything  for his sake!” she cried. “It’s splendid!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Fine! I
don’t want anything, Prince.”
“Yes, but you are not the only one. There are your sisters...”
replied Prince Vasíli. But the princess did not listen to him. “Yes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. I knew that I could
expect nothing but meanness, deceit, envy , intrigue, and ingratitude
—the blackest ingratitude—in this house...”
“Do you or do you not know where that will is?” insisted Prince
Vasíli, his cheeks twitching more than ever . “Yes, I was a fool!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"I still believed in people, loved them, and
sacrificed myself. But only the base, the vile succeed! I know who
has been intriguing!”
The princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand. She had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole
human race. She gave her companion an angry glance. “There is still time, my dear. You must remember , Catiche, that it
was all done casually in a moment of anger , of illness, and was
afterwards forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to
ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and
not to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who...”
“Who sacrificed everything for him,” chimed in the princess, who
would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, “though
he never could appre ciate it. No, mon cousin ,” she adde d with a sigh,
“I shall always remember that in this world one must expect no
reward, that in this world there is neither honor nor justice. In this
world one has to be cunning and cruel.”
“Now come, come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart.”
“No, I have a wicked heart.”
“I know your heart, ” repeated the princ e. “I value your friendship
and wish you to have as good an opinion of me. Don’ t upset
yourself, and let us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

all where it is. You must know . We will take it at once and show it to
the count. He has, no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to destroy it. You under stand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his
wishes; that is my only reason for being here. I came simply to help
him and you.”
“Now I see it all! I know who has been intriguing—I know!” cried
the princess. “That’ s not the point, my dear .”
“It’s that protégé of yours, that sweet Princess Drubetskáya, that
Anna Mikháylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid... the
infamous, vile woman!”
“Do not let us lose any time...”
“Ah, don’t talk to me! Last winter she wheedled herself in here
and told the count such vile, disgraceful things about us, especially
about Sophie—I can’t repeat them—that it made the count quite ill
and he would not see us for a whole fortnight. I know it was then he
wrote this vile, infamous paper , but I thought the thing was invalid.”
“We’ve got to it at last—why did you not tell me about it sooner?”
“It’s in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps  under his pillow ,” said the
princess, ignoring his question. “Now I know! Yes; if I have a sin, a
great sin, it is hatred of that vile woman!” almost shrieked the
princess, now quite changed. “And what does she come worming
herself in here for?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"

will come!”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

While these conver sations were going on in the reception room
and the princess’  room, a carriage containing Pierre (who had been
sent for) and Anna Mikháylovna (who found it necessary to
accompany him) was driving into the court of Count Bezúkhov’ s
house. As the wheels rolled softly over the straw beneath the
windows, Anna Mikháylovna, having turned with words of comfort
to her companion, realized that he was asleep in his corner and woke
him up. Rousing himself, Pierre followed Anna Mikháylovna out of
the carriage, and only then began to think of the interview with his
dying father which awaited him. He noticed that they had not come
to the front entrance but to the back door. While he was getting down
from the carriage steps two men, who looked like tradespeople, ran
hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed several other men of the same
kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides. But neither
Anna Mikháylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, who could
not help seeing these people, took any notice of them. “It seems to be
all right,” Pierre concluded, and followed Anna Mikháylovna. She
hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to
Pierre, who was lagging behind, to follow . Though he did not see
why it was necessary for him to go to the count at all, still less why
he had to go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna Mikháylovna’ s
air of assurance and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely
necessary . Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by
some men who, carrying pails, came running downstairs, their boots
clattering. These men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna
Mikháylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing
them there. “Is this the way to the princesses’  apartments?” asked Anna
Mikháylovna of one of them. “Yes,” replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as if anything were
now permissible; “the door to the left, ma’am.”
“Perhaps the count did not ask for me,” said Pierre when he
reached the landing. “I’d better go to my own room.”
Anna Mikháylovna paused and waited for him to come up. “Ah, my friend!” she said, touching his arm as she had done her
son’s when speaking to him that afternoon, “believe me I suffer no
less than you do, but be a man!”
“But really , hadn’ t I better go away?” he asked, looking kindly at
her over his spectacles. “Ah, my dear friend ! Forget the wrongs  that may have been done
you. Think  that he is your father ... perhaps in the agony of death.”
She sighed . “I have loved you like a son from the first.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Trust yourself
to me, Pierre. I shall not for get your interests.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 87/174Pierre did not under stand a word, but the conviction that all this
had to be grew stronger , and he meekly followed Anna Mikháylovna
who was already opening a door . This door led into a back anteroom. An old man, a servant of the
princesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking. Pierre had never been
in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of
these rooms. Anna Mikháylovna, addressing a maid who was
hurrying past with a decanter on a tray as “my dear” and “my sweet,”
asked about the princess’  health and then led Pierre along a stone
passage. The first door on the left led into the princesses’  apartments. The maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door
(everything in the house was done in haste at that time), and Pierre
and Anna Mikháylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the
room, where Prince Vasíli and the eldes t princess were sitting close
together talking. Seeing them pass, Prince Vasíli drew back with
obvious impatience, while the princess jumped up and with a gesture
of desperation slammed the door with all her might. This action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear
depicted on Prince Vasíli’ s face so out of keeping with his dignity
that Pierre  stopped and glanced inquirin gly over his spectacles at his
guide. Anna Mikháylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled
faintly and sighed, as if to say that this was no more than she had
expected. “Be a man, my frien d.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"I will look after your interests,” said she in
reply to his look, and went still faster along the passage. Pierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what
“watching over his interests” meant, but he decided that all these
things had to be. From the passage they went into a large, dimly lit
room adjoining the count’ s reception room. It was one of those
sumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front
approach, but even in this room there now stood an empty bath, and
water had been spilled on the carpet. They were met by a deacon
with a censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without
heeding them. They went into the recep tion room familiar to Pierre,
with two Italian windows opening into the conservatory , with its
large bust and full length portrait of Catherine the Great. The same
people were still sitting here in almost the same positions as before,
whispering to one another . All became  silent and turned to look at
the pale tear-worn Anna Mikháylovna as she entered, and at the big
stout figure of Pierre who, hanging his head, meekly followed her . Anna Mikháylovna’ s face expressed a consciousness that the
decisive moment had arrived. With the air of a practical Petersbur g
lady she now, keepin g Pierre close beside her, entered the room even
more boldly than that afternoon. She felt that as she brought with her
the person  the dying man wished to see, her own admission was
assured. Casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing
the count’ s confessor there, she glided up to him with a sort of
amble, not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller ,
and respec tfully received the blessing first of one and then of another
priest. “God be thanked that you are in time,” said she to one of the
priests; “all we relatives have been in such anxiety . This young man6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 88/174is the count’ s son,” she added more softly . “What a terrible
moment!”
Having said this she went up to the doctor . “Dear doctor,” said she, “this young man is the count’ s son. Is
there any hope?”
The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his
shoulders. Anna Mikháylovna with just the same movement raised
her shoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter , sighed, and moved
away from the doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly respectful
and tenderly sad voice, she said:
“Trust in His mercy !” and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit
and wait for her, she went silently towar d the door that everyone was
watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it. Pierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly ,
moved toward the sofa she had indicated. As soon as Anna
Mikháylovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the
room turned to him with something more than curiosity and
sympathy . He noticed that they whisp ered to one another , casting
significant looks at him with a kind of awe and even servility .","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"A
deference such as he had never before received was shown him. A
strange lady, the one who had been talking to the priests, rose and
offered him her seat; an aide-de-camp picked up and returned a glove
Pierre had dropped; the doctors became respectfully silent as he
passed by, and move d to make way for him. At first Pierre wished to
take another seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to pick up the
glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not even in his
way; but all at once he felt that this would not do, and that tonight he
was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which
everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore bound to accept
their services. He took the glove in silence from the aide-de-camp,
and sat down in the lady’ s chair , placing his huge hands
symmetrically on his knees in the naïve attitude of an Egyptian
statue, and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be, and
that in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not
act on his own ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the
will of those who were guiding him. Not two minutes had passed before Prince Vasíli with head erect
majestically entered  the room. He was wearing his long coat with
three stars on his breast. He seemed to have grown thinner since the
morning; his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round
and notice d Pierre. He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he
never used to do), and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain
whether it was firmly fixed on. “Courage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you. That is
well!” and he turned to go. But Pierre  thought it necessary to ask: “How is...” and hesitated,
not knowing whether it would be prope r to call the dying man “the
count,” yet ashamed to call him “father .”
“He had another stroke about half an hour ago. Courage, my
friend...”
Pierre’ s mind was in such a confused state that the word “stroke”
suggested to him a blow from something. He looked at Prince Vasíli6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 89/174in perplex ity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of
illness. Prince Vasíli said something to Lorrain in passing and went
through the door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his
whole body jerked at each step. The eldest princess followed him,
and the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the
door. Through that door was heard a noise of things being moved
about, and at last Anna Mikháylovna, still with the same expression,
pale but resolute in the dischar ge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre
lightly on the arm said:
“The divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to be
administered. Come.”
Pierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed
that the strange lady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the servants, all
followed him in, as if there were now no further need for permission
to enter that room.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 90/174CHAPTER XXIII
Pierre well knew this large room divide d by columns and an arch,
its walls hung round with Persian carpets. The part of the room
behind the columns, with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead
on one side and on the other an immens e case containing icons, was
brightly illuminated with red light like a Russian church during
evening service. Under the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair ,
and in that chair on snowy-white smooth pillows, evidently freshly
changed, Pierre saw—covered to the waist by a bright green quilt—
the familiar , majestic figure of his father , Count Bezúkhov , with that
gray mane  of hair above his broad foreh ead which reminded one of a
lion, and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome,
ruddy face. He lay just under the icons; his large thick hands outside
the quilt. Into the right hand, which was lying palm downwards, a
wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb, and an old
servant, bending over from behind the chair , held it in position. By
the chair stood the priests, their long hair falling over their
magnificent glittering vestments, with lighted tapers in their hands,
slowly and solemnl y conducting the service. A little behind them
stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their
eyes, and just in front of them their eldest sister , Catiche, with a
vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons, as though
declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she
glance round. Anna  Mikháylovna, with a meek, sorrowful, and all-
forgiving expression on her face, stood by the door near the strange
lady. Princ e Vasíli in front of the door, near the invalid chair , a wax
taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on the carved back of
a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose, and was crossing
himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward each time he
touched his forehead. His face wore a calm look of piety and
resignation to the will of God. “If you do not understand these
sentiments,” he seemed to be saying, “so much the worse for you!”
Behind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and the
menservants; the men and women had separated as in church. All
were silen tly crossi ng themselves, and the reading of the church
service, the subdued chanting of deep bass voices, and in the
intervals sighs and the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that
could be heard. Anna Mikháylovna, with an air of importance that
showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about, went across
the room to where Pierre was standing and gave him a taper . He lit it
and, distracted by observing those around him, began crossing
himself with the hand that held the taper . Sophie, the rosy, laughter -loving, youngest princess with the mole,
watched him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and
remained with it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing
Pierre she again began to laugh. She evidently felt unable to look at
him without laughing, but could not resist looking at him: so to be
out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns. In6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 91/174the midst of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased,
they whispered to one another , and the old servant who was holding
the count’ s hand got up and said something to the ladies. Anna
Mikháylovna stepped forward and, stooping over the dying man,
beckoned to Lorrain from behind her back. The French doctor held
no taper; he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful
attitude implying that he, a foreigner , in spite of all differences of
faith, unde rstood the full importance of the rite now being performed
and even approved of it. He now approached the sick man with the
noiseless step of one in full vigor of life, with his delicate white
fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free, and turning
sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment. The sick man was
given something to drink, there was a stir around him, then the
people resumed their places and the service continued. During this
interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vasíli left the chair on which he
had been leaning, and—with an air which intimated that he knew
what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so
much the worse for them—did not go up to the dying man, but
passed by him, joined the eldest princes s, and moved with her to the
side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken
hangings. On leaving the bed both Prince Vasíli and the princess
passed out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the
other before the service was concluded. Pierre paid no more attention
to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made up
his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that
evening was in some way essential. The chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest was
heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received
the sacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as
before. Around him everyone began to stir: steps were audible and
whispers, among which Anna Mikháylovna’ s was the most distinct. Pierre heard her say:
“Certainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will be
impossible...”
The sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and
servants that Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face with
its gray mane—which, though he saw other faces as well, he had not
lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service. He judged
by the cautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid
chair that they had lifted the dying man and were moving him. “Catch hold of my arm or you’ll drop him!” he heard one of the
servants say in a frightened whisper . “Catch hold from underneath. Here!” exclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the
bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the
weight they were carrying were too much for them. As the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikháylovna, passed the
young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and
backs of the dying man’ s high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful
shoulders, raised by those who were holding him under the armpits,
and of his gray, curly , leonine head. This head, with its remarkably
broad brow and cheekbones, its handsome, sensual mouth, and its
cold, maje stic expression, was not disfigured by the approach of
death. It was the same as Pierre remem bered it three months before,6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 92/174when the count had sent him to Petersbur g. But now this head was
swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers, and
the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing. After a few minutes ’ bustle beside the high bedstead, those who
had carried the sick man dispersed. Anna Mikháylovna touched
Pierre’ s hand and said, “Come.” Pierre went with her to the bed on
which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with
the ceremony just completed. He lay with his head propped high on
the pillows. His hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk
quilt, the palms downward. When Pierre came up the count was
gazing straight at him, but with a look the significance of which
could not be understood by mortal man. Either this look meant
nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look somewhere,
or it mean t too much. Pierre hesitated, not knowing what to do, and
glanced inquiringly at his guide. Anna Mikháylovna made a hurried
sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick man’ s hand and moving her
lips as if to send it a kiss. Pierre, carefu lly stretching his neck so as
not to touch the quilt, followed her sugg estion and pressed his lips to
the large boned, fleshy hand. Neither the hand nor a single muscle of
the count’ s face stirred. Once more Pierre looked questioningly at
Anna Mikháylovna to see what he was to do next. Anna
Mikháylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the
bed. Pierr e obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were doing
right. Anna Mikháylovna nodded approvingly . Again Pierre fell into
the naïvely symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently
distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and
doing his utmost to look as small as possible. He looked at the count,
who still gazed at the spot where Pierre’ s face had been before he sat
down. Anna Mikháylovna indicated by her attitude her
consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of
meeting between the father and son. This lasted about two minutes,
which to Pierre seemed an hour. Suddenly the broad muscles and
lines of the count’ s face began to twitch. The twitching increased, the
handsome mouth was drawn to one side (only now did Pierre realize
how near death his father was), and from  that distorted mouth issued
an indistinct, hoarse sound. Anna Mikháylovna looked attentively at
the sick man’ s eyes, trying to guess what he wanted; she pointed first
to Pierre, then to some drink, then named Prince Vasíli in an
inquiring whisper , then pointed to the quilt. The eyes and face of the
sick man showed impatience. He made an effort to look at the
servant who stood constantly at the head of the bed. “Wants to turn on the other side,” whispered the servant, and got
up to turn the count’ s heavy body toward the wall. Pierre rose to help him. While the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell back
helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward. Whether
he noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless
arm, or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain, at
any rate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierre’ s terror -stricken
face, and again at the arm, and on his face a feeble, piteous smile
appeared, quite out of keeping with his features, that seemed to
deride his own helplessness. At sight of this smile Pierre felt an
unexpected quiverin g in his breast and a tickling in his nose, and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 93/174tears dimmed his eyes. The sick man was turned on to his side with
his face to the wall. He sighed. “He is dozing,” said Anna Mikháylovna, observing that one of the
princesses was coming to take her turn at watching. “Let us go.”
Pierre went out.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 94/174CHAPTER XXIV
There was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vasíli
and the eldest princess, who were sitting under the portrait of
Catherine the Great and talking eagerly . As soon as they saw Pierre
and his companion they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the
princess hide something as she whispered:
“I can’ t bear the sight of that woman.”
“Catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room,” said
Prince Vasíli to Anna Mikháylovna. “Go and take something, my
poor Anna Mikháylovna, or you will not hold out.”
To Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic
squeeze below the shoulder . Pierre went with Anna Mikháylovna
into the small drawing room. “There is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of
this delicious Russian tea,” Lorrain was saying with an air of
restrained animation  as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese
handleless cup before a table on which  tea and a cold supper were
laid in the small circular room. Around the table all who were at
Count Bezúkhov’ s house that night had gathered to fortify
themselves. Pierre well remembered this small circular drawing
room with its mirrors and little tables. During balls given at the
house Pierre, who did not know how to dance, had liked sitting in
this room to watch the ladies who, as they passed through in their
ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders, looked
at themsel ves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their
reflections several times. Now this same room was dimly lighted by
two candles. On one small table tea things and supper dishes stood in
disorder , and in the middle of the night a motley throng of people sat
there, not merrymaking, but somberly whispering, and betraying by
every word and movement that they none of them forgot what was
happening and what was about to happe n in the bedroom. Pierre did
not eat anything though he would very much have liked to. He
looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going
on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left Prince Vasíli and
the eldest princess. Pierre concluded that this also was essential, and
after a short interval followed her. Anna Mikháylovna was standing
beside the princess, and they were both speaking in excited whispers. “Permit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not
necessary ,” said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the
same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her
room. “But, my dear princess,” answered Anna Mikháylovna blandly but
impressively , blocki ng the way to the bedroom and preventing the
other from passing, “won’ t this be too much for poor Uncle at a
moment when he needs repose? Worldly conversation at a moment
when his soul is already prepared...”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 95/174Prince Vasíli was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude,
with one leg crossed high above the other . His cheeks, which were so
flabby that they looked heavier below , were twitching violently; but
he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were
saying. “Come, my dear Anna Mikháylovna, let Catiche do as she pleases. You know how fond the count is of her .”
“I don’t even know what is in this paper ,” said the younger of the
two ladies, addressing Prince Vasíli and pointing to an inlaid
portfolio she held in her hand. “All I know is that his real will is in
his writing table, and this is a paper he has for gotten....”
She tried to pass Anna Mikháylovna, but the latter sprang so as to
bar her path. “I know, my dear, kind princess,” said Anna Mikháylovna, seizing
the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily . “Dear princess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him! Je
vous en conjur e...”
The princess did not reply . Their efforts in the struggle for the
portfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was evident that if the
princess did speak, her words would  not be flattering to Anna
Mikháylovna. Though the latter held on tenaciously , her voice lost
none of its honeyed firmness and softness. “Pierre, my dear, come here. I think he will not be out of place in a
family consultation; is it not so, Prince?”
“Why don’t you speak, cousin?” suddenly shrieked the princess so
loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled. “Why do you remai n silent when heave n knows who permits herself
to interfere, making a scene on the very threshold of a dying man’ s
room? Intriguer!” she hissed viciously , and tugged with all her might
at the portfolio. But Anna Mikháylovna went forward a step or two to keep her
hold on the portfolio, and changed her grip. Prince Vasíli rose. “Oh!” said he with reproach and surprise, “this
is absurd! Come, let go I tell you.”
The princess let go. “And you too!”
But Anna Mikháylovna did not obey him. “Let go, I tell you!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"I will take the responsibility . I myself will go
and ask him, I!... does that satisfy you?”
“But, Prince,” said Anna Mikháylovna, “after such a solemn
sacrament, allow him a moment’ s peace ! Here, Pierre, tell them your
opinion,” said she, turning to the young man who, having come quite
close, was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess
which had lost all dignity , and at the twitching cheeks of Prince
Vasíli. “Remember that you will answer for the consequences,” said
Prince Vasíli severely . “You don’ t know what you are doing.”
“Vile woman!” shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly at Anna
Mikháylovna and snatching the portfolio from her . Prince Vasíli bent his head and spread out his hands.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 96/174At this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so
long and which had always opened so quietly , burst noisily open and
banged against the wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed
out wringing her hands. “What are you doing!” she cried vehemently . “He is dying and
you leave me alone with him!”
Her sister dropped the portfolio. Anna Mikháylovna, stooping,
quickly caught up the object of contenti on and ran into the bedroom. The eldest princess and Prince Vasíli, recovering themselves,
followed her. A few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a
pale hard face, again biting her underlip. At sight of Pierre her
expression showed an irrepressible hatred. “Yes, now you may be glad!” said she; “this is what you have been
waiting for.” And bursting into tears  she hid her face in her
handkerchief and rushed from the room. Prince Vasíli came next. He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre
was sittin g and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand. Pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook
as if in an ague. “Ah, my friend!” said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; and there
was in his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed
in it befor e. “How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for
what? I am near sixty, dear friend... I too...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"All will end in death, all! Death is awful...” and he burst into tears. Anna Mikháylovna came out last. She approached Pierre with
slow, quiet steps. “Pierre!” she said. Pierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed the young man on
his forehead, wetting him with her tears. Then after a pause she said:
“He is no more....”
Pierre looked at her over his spectacles. “Come, I will go with you. Try to weep, nothing gives such relief
as tears.”
She led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no
one could  see his face. Anna Mikháylovna left him, and when she
returned he was fast asleep with his head on his arm. In the morning Anna Mikháylovna said to Pierre:
“Yes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you. But God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in
command of an immense fortune. The will has not yet been opened. I
know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head,
but it imposes duties on you, and you must be a man.”
Pierre was silent. “Perhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not
been there, God only knows what would have happened! You know ,
Uncle promised me only the day before yesterday not to forget Borís. But he had no time. I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your
father ’s wish?”
Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in
silence at Princess Anna Mikháylovna . After her talk with Pierre,6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 97/174Anna Mikháylovna returned to the Rostóvs’  and went to bed. On
waking in the morni ng she told the Rostóvs and all her acquaintances
the details  of Count Bezúkhov’ s death. She said the count had died
as she would herself  wish to die, that his end was not only touching
but edifying. As to the last meeting between father and son, it was so
touching that she could not think of it without tears, and did not
know which had behaved better during those awful moments—the
father who so remembered everything and everybody at last and had
spoken such pathetic words to the son, or Pierre, whom it had been
pitiful to see, so stricken was he with grief, though he tried hard to
hide it in order not to sadden his dying father . “It is painful, but it
does one good.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"It uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count
and his worthy son,”  said she. Of the behavior of the eldest princess
and Prince  Vasíli she spoke disapprovingly , but in whispers and as a
great secret.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

At Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Andréevich Bolkónski’ s estate, the
arrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected, but
this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old
prince’ s household. General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andréevich
(nicknamed in society , “the King of Prussia”) ever since the Emperor
Paul had exiled him to his count ry estate had lived there
continuously with his daughter , Princess Mary , and her companion,
Mademoiselle Bourienne. Though in the new reign he was free to
return to the capit als, he still continued to live in the country ,
remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come the
hundred miles from Moscow to Bald Hills, while he himself needed
no one and nothing. He used to say that there are only two sources of
human vice—idleness and superstition, and only two virtues—
activity and intelligence. He himself  undertook his daughter ’s
education, and to develop these two cardinal virtues in her gave her
lessons in algebra and geometry till she was twenty , and arranged her
life so that her whole time was occup ied. He was himself always
occupied: writing his memoirs, solving problems in higher
mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, working in the garden,
or superintending the building that was always going on at his estate. As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity , regularity in
his household was carried to the highest point of exactitude. He
always came to table under precisely the same conditions, and not
only at the same hour but at the same minute. With those about him,
from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp and invariably
exacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such
fear and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused. Although he was in retirement and had now no influence in political
affairs, every high official appointed to the province in which the
prince’ s estate lay considered it his duty to visit him and waited in
the lofty antechamber just as the architect, gardener , or Princess
Mary did, till the prince appeared punctually to the appointed hour. Everyone sitting in this antechamber experienced the same feeling of
respect and even fear when the enormously high study door opened
and showed the figure of a rather small old man, with powdered wig,
small withered hands, and bushy gray eyebrows which, when he
frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd, youthfully
glittering eyes. On the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive,
Princess Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time
appointed for the morning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation
and repeat ing a silent prayer . Every morning she came in like that,
and every  morning prayed that the daily interview might pass off
well. An old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber
rose quietly and said in a whisper: “Please walk in.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 99/174Through the door came the regular hum of a lathe. The princess
timidly opened the door which moved  noiselessly and easily . She
paused at the entrance. The prince was working at the lathe and after
glancing round continued his work. The enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use. The large table cove red with books and plans, the tall glass-fronted
bookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while
standing up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with
tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around—all indicated
continuous, varied, and orderly activity . The motion of the small foot
shod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver , and the firm pressure
of the lean sinewy hand, showed that the prince still possessed the
tenacious endurance  and vigor of hardy old age. After a few more
turns of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal, wiped his
chisel, dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe, and,
approaching the table, summoned his daughter . He never gave his
children a blessing, so he simply held out his bristly cheek (as yet
unshaven) and, regarding her tenderly and attentively , said severely:
“Quite well? All right then, sit down.” He took the exercise book
containing lessons in geometry written  by himself and drew up a
chair with his foot. “For tomorrow!” said he, quickly findi ng the page and making a
scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail. The princess bent over the exercise book on the table. “Wait a bit, here’ s a letter for you,” said the old man suddenly ,
taking a letter addressed in a woman’ s hand from a bag hanging
above the table, onto which he threw it. At the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the
princess’  face. She took it quickly and bent her head over it. “From Héloïse?” asked the prince with a cold smile that showed
his still sound, yellowish teeth. “Yes, it’s from Julie ,” replied the princess with a timid glance and
a timid smile. “I’ll let two more letters pass, but the third I’ll read,” said the
prince sternly; “I’m afraid you write much nonsense. I’ll read the
third!”
“Read this if you like, Father ,” said the princess, blushing still
more and holding out the letter . “The third, I said the third!” cried the prince abruptly , pushing the
letter away , and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him
the exercise book containing geometrical figures. “Well, madam,” he began, stooping over the book close to his
daughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she
sat, so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent
of old age and tobacco, which she had known so long. “Now ,
madam, these triangles are equal; please note that the angle ABC ...”
The prince ss looked in a scared way at her father ’s eyes glittering
close to her; the red patches on her face came and went, and it was
plain that she unders tood nothing and was so frightened that her fear
would prevent her understanding any of her father ’s further
explanations, however clear they might be. Whether it was the6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 100/174teacher ’s fault or the pupil’ s, this same thing happened every day: the
princess’  eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear
anything, but was only conscious of her stern father ’s withered face
close to her, of his breath and the smell of him, and could think only
of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the
problem in peace. The old man was beside himself: moved the chair
on which he was sitting noisily backward and forward, made efforts
to control himself and not become vehement, but almost always did
become vehement, scolded, and sometimes flung the exercise book
away . The princess gave a wrong answer . “Well now, isn’t she a fool!” shouted the prince, pushing the book
aside and turning sharply away; but rising immediately , he paced up
and down, lightly touched his daughter ’s hair and sat down again. He drew up his chair , and continued to explain. “This won’t do, Princess; it won’ t do,” said he, when Princess
Mary , having taken and closed the exercise book with the next day’s
lesson, was about to leave: “Mathematics are most important,
madam! I don’t want to have you like our silly ladies. Get used to it
and you’ll like it,” and he patted her cheek. “It will drive all the
nonsense out of your head.”
She turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an
uncut book from the high desk. “Here is some sort of Key to the Mysteries  that your Héloïse has
sent you. Religious!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"I don’t interfere with anyone’ s belief... I have
looked at it.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
Take it.,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Well, now go. Go.”
He patted  her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after
her. Princess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared
expression that rarely left her and which made her plain, sickly face
yet plaine r. She sat down at her writing table, on which stood
miniature portraits and which was littered with books and papers. The princess was as untidy as her father was tidy. She put down the
geometry book and eagerly broke the seal of her letter . It was from
her most intimate friend from childhood; that same Julie Karágina
who had been at the Rostóvs’  name-day party . Julie wrote in French:
Dear and precious Friend, How terribl e and frightful a thing is
separation! Though I tell myself that half my life and half my
happiness are wrapped up in you, and that in spite of the distance
separating us our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds, my heart
rebels against fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions
around me I cannot overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in
my heart ever since we parted. Why are we not together as we were
last summer , in your big study , on the blue sofa, the confidential
sofa? Why  cannot I now, as three months ago, draw fresh moral
strength from your look, so gentle, calm, and penetrating, a look I
loved so well and seem to see before me as I write? Having read thus far, Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the
mirror which stood on her right. It reflected a weak, ungraceful
figure and thin face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked with
particular hopelessn ess at her reflection in the glass. “She flatters6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 101/174me,” thought the princess, turning away  and continuing to read. But
Julie did not flatter  her friend, the princess’  eyes—lar ge, deep and
luminous (it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shafts of
warm light)—were so beautiful that very often in spite of the
plainness of her face they gave her an attraction more powerful than
that of beauty . But the princess never saw the beautiful expression of
her own eyes—the look they had when she was not thinking of
herself. As with everyone, her face assumed a forced unnatural
expression as soon as she looked in a glass. She went on reading:
All Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my two brothers is
already abroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on their
march to the frontier . Our dear Emperor has left Petersbur g and it is
thought intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war. God grant that the Corsican monster who is destroying the peace of
Europe may be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the
Almighty , in His goodness, to give us as sovereign! To say nothing
of my brothers, this war has deprived me of one of the associations
nearest my heart. I mean young Nicholas Rostóv , who with his
enthusiasm could not bear to remain  inactive and has left the
university to join the army . I will confess to you, dear Mary , that in
spite of his extreme youth his departu re for the army was a great
grief to me. This young man, of whom I spoke to you last summer , is
so noble-m inded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom
finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly , he is
so frank and has so much heart. He is so pure and poetic that my
relations with him, transient as they were, have been one of the
sweetest comforts to my poor heart, which has already suffered so
much. Someday I will tell you about our parting and all that was said
then. That is still too fresh. Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to
know these poignant joys and sorrows . You are fortunate, for the
latter are generally  the stronger! I know very well that Count
Nicholas is too young ever to be more to me than a friend, but this
sweet friendship, this poetic and pure intimacy , were what my heart
needed. But enough of this! The chief news, about which all Moscow
gossips, is the death of old Count Bezúkhov , and his inheritance. Fancy! The three princesses have received very little, Prince Vasíli
nothing, and it is Monsieur Pierre who has inherited all the property
and has besides been recognized as legitimate; so that he is now
Count Bezúkhov and possessor of the finest fortune in Russia. It is
rumored that Prince Vasíli played a very despicable part in this affair
and that he returned to Petersbur g quite crestfallen. I confess I understa nd very little about all these matters of wills
and inheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom we
all used to know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count
Bezúkhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I
am much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the
mammas burdened by marriageable daughters, and of the young
ladies themselves, toward him, though, between you and me, he
always seemed to me a poor sort of fellow . As for the past two years
people have amused themselves by findi ng husbands for me (most of
whom I don’t even know), the matchm aking chronicles of Moscow
now speak of me as the future Counte ss Bezúkhova. But you will
understand that I have no desire for the post. À propos of marria ges:

marriage for you. It is neither more nor less than with Prince Vasíli’ s
son Anato le, whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone
rich and distinguée , and it is on you that his relations’  choice has
fallen. I don’t know  what you will think of it, but I consider it my
duty to let you know of it.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"

"JULIE
P.S. Let me have news of your brother and his charming little
wife. The princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her
luminous eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed. Then
she sudden ly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table. She
took a sheet of paper and her hand moved rapidly over it. This is the
reply she wrote, also in French:
Dear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has given me
great delig ht. So you still love me, my romantic Julie? Separation, of
which you say so much that is bad, does not seem to have had its
usual effect on you. You complain of our separation. What then
should I say, if I dared complain, I who am deprived of all who are
dear to me? Ah, if we had not religion to console us life would be
very sad. Why do you suppose that I should look severely on your
affection for that young man? On such matters I am only severe with
myself. I understand such feelings in others, and if never having felt
them I cannot approve of them, neither  do I condemn them. Only it
seems to me that Christian love, love of one’s neighbor , love of one’s
enemy , is worthier , sweeter , and better  than the feelings which the
beautiful eyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and loving
young girl like yourself. The news of Count Bezúkhov’ s death reached us before your letter
and my father was much affected by it. He says the count was the
last representative but one of the great century , and that it is his own
turn now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as
possible. God preserve us from that terrible misfortune! I cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as a child. He
always seemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the
quality I value most in people. As to his inheritance and the part
played by Prince Vasíli, it is very sad for both. Ah, my dear friend,
our divine Saviour ’s words, that it is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God,
are terribl y true. I pity Prince Vasíli but am still more sorry for
Pierre. So young, and burdened with such riches—to what
temptations he will be exposed! If I were asked what I desire most
on earth, it would be to be poorer than the poorest beggar . A6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 103/174thousand thanks, dear friend, for the volume you have sent me and
which has such success in Moscow . Yet since you tell me that among
some good things it contains others which our weak human
understanding cannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to spend
time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit. I never could understand the fondness some people have for
confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely
awaken their doubts and excite their imagination, giving them a bent
for exagge ration quite contrary to Christian simplicity . Let us rather
read the Epistles and Gospels. Let us not seek to penetrate what
mysteries they contain; for how can we, miserable sinners that we
are, know  the terrible and holy secrets of Providence while we
remain in this flesh  which forms an impenetrable veil between us
and the Eternal? Let us rather confine ourselves to studying those
sublime rules which our divine Saviour has left for our guidance here
below . Let us try to conform to them and follow them, and let us be
persuaded that the less we let our feeble human minds roam, the
better we shall pleas e God, who rejects  all knowledge that does not
come from Him; and the less we seek to fathom what He has been
pleased to conceal from us, the sooner will He vouchsafe its
revelation to us through His divine Spirit. My father  has not spoken to me of a suitor , but has only told me
that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince
Vasíli. In regard to this project of marr iage for me, I will tell you,
dear sweet friend, that I look on marriage as a divine institution to
which we must conform. However painful it may be to me, should
the Almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to
perform them as faithfully as I can, without disquieting myself by
examining my feelings toward him whom He may give me for
husband. I have had a letter from my brother , who announces his speedy
arrival at Bald Hills with his wife.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"This pleasure will be but a brief
one, however , for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy
war into which we have been drawn, God knows how or why. Not
only wher e you are—at the heart of affairs and of the world—is the
talk all of war, even here amid fieldwo rk and the calm of nature—
which townsfolk consider characteristic of the country—rumors of
war are heard and painfully felt. My father talks of nothing but
marches and countermarches, things of which I understand nothing;
and the day before  yesterday during my daily walk through the
village I witnessed  a heartrending scene.... It was a convoy of
conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to join the army . You should have seen the state of the mothers, wives, and children of
the men who were going and should have heard the sobs. It seems as
though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine Saviour , Who
preached love and forgiveness of injuries—and that men attribute the
greatest merit to skill in killing one another . Adieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine Saviour and His most
Holy Mother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care! MAR Y
“Ah, you are sending off a letter , Princess? I have already
dispatched mine. I have written to my poor mother ,” said the smiling
Mademoiselle Bourienne rapidly , in her pleasant mellow tones and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

mournful, and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere, careless,
lighthearted, and self-satisfied. “Princess, I must warn you,” she added, lowering her voice and
evidently listening to herself with pleasure, and speaking with
exaggerated grasseyement , “the prince has been scolding Michael
Ivánovich. He is in a very bad humor , very morose. Be prepared.”
“Ah, dear friend,” replied Princess Mary , “I have asked you never
to warn me of the humor my father is in. I do not allow myself to
judge him and would not have others do so.”
The princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was five
minutes late in starting her practice on the clavichord, went into the
sitting room with a look of alarm. Between twelve and two o’clock,
as the day was mapped out, the prince rested and the princess played
the clavichord.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 105/174CHAPTER XXVI
The gray-haired valet was sitting drows ily listening to the snoring
of the prince, who was in his large study . From the far side of the
house through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages
—twenty times repeated—of a sonata by Dussek. Just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the
porch. Prince Andre w got out of the carriage, helped his little wife to
alight, and let her pass into the hous e before him. Old Tíkhon,
wearing a wig, put his head out of the door of the antechamber ,
reported in a whispe r that the prince was sleeping, and hastily closed
the door. Tíkhon knew that neither the son’s arrival nor any other
unusual event must be allowed to distu rb the appointed order of the
day. Prince Andrew apparently knew this as well as Tíkhon; he
looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his father ’s habits had
changed since he was at home last, and, having assured himself that
they had not, he turned to his wife. “He will get up in twenty minutes. Let us go across to Mary’ s
room,” he said. The little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes
and her short, down y, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just
as merrily and prettily as ever . “Why , this is a palace!” she said to her husband, looking around
with the expression with which people  compliment their host at a
ball. “Let’s come, quick, quick!” And with a glance round, she
smiled at Tíkhon, at her husband, and at the footman who
accompanied them. “Is that Mary practicing? Let’s go quietly and take her by
surprise.”
Prince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression. “You’ve grown older , Tíkhon,” he said in passing to the old man,
who kissed his hand. Before they reached the room from which the sounds of the
clavichord came, the pretty , fair-haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle
Bourienne, rushed out apparently beside herself with delight. “Ah! what joy for the princess!” exclaimed she: “At last! I must
let her know .”
“No, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne,” said the
little princess, kissing her. “I know you already through my sister -in-
law’s friendship for you. She was not expecting us?”
They went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the
sound of the oft-repeated passage of the sonata. Prince Andrew
stopped and made a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant. The little princess entered the room. The passage broke off in the
middle, a cry was heard, then Princess Mary’ s heavy tread and the
sound of kissing. When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses,6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 106/174who had only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were
in each other ’s arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place
they happened to touch. Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them
pressing her hand to her heart, with a beatific smile and obviously
equally ready to cry or to laugh. Prince Andrew shrugged his
shoulders and frowned, as lovers of music do when they hear a false
note. The two wome n let go of one another, and then, as if afraid of
being too late, seized each other ’s hands, kissing them and pulling
them away , and again began kissing each other on the face, and then
to Prince Andrew’ s surprise both began to cry and kissed again. Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to cry. Prince Andrew evidently
felt ill at ease, but to the two women it seemed quite natural that they
should cry, and apparently it never entered their heads that it could
have been otherwise at this meeting. “Ah!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"my dear!... Ah! Mary!...” they suddenly exclaimed, and then
laughed. “I dreamed last night...”—“Y ou were not expecting us?...”
“Ah! Mary , you have got thinner?...” “And you have grown
stouter!...”
“I knew the princess at once,” put in Mademoiselle Bourienne. “And I had no idea!...” exclaimed Princess Mary . “Ah, Andrew , I
did not see you.”
Prince Andrew and his sister , hand in hand, kissed one another ,
and he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever. Princess Mary
had turned toward her brother , and through her tears the loving,
warm, gentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful at that
moment, rested on Prince Andrew’ s face. The little princess talked incessantly , her short, downy upper lip
continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary
and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile
of glittering teeth and sparkling eyes. She told of an accident they
had had on the Spásski Hill which might have been serious for her in
her condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had
left all her clothes in Petersbur g and that heaven knew what she
would have to dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and
that Kitty Odýntsova had married an old man, and that there was a
suitor for Mary , a real one, but that they would talk of that later. Princess Mary was still looking silen tly at her brother and her
beautiful eyes were full of love and sadness. It was plain that she was
following a train of thought independent of her sister -in-law’ s words. In the midst of a description of the last Petersbur g fete she addressed
her brother:
“So you are really going to the war , Andrew?” she said sighing. Lise sighed too. “Yes, and even tomorrow ,” replied her brother . “He is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had
promotion...”
Princess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of
thought turned to her sister -in-law with a tender glance at her figure. “Is it certain?” she said. The face of the little princess changed. She sighed and said: “Yes,
quite certain.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Ah! it is very dreadful...”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 107/174Her lip descended. She brought her face close to her sister -in-law’ s
and unexpectedly again began to cry . “She needs rest,” said Prince Andrew with a frown. “Don’ t you,
Lise? Take her to your room and I’ll go to Father . How is he? Just
the same?”
“Yes, just the same. Though I don’t know what your opinion will
be,” answered the princess joyfully . “And are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"And
the lathe? ” asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile
which showed that, in spite of all his love and respect for his father ,
he was aware of his weaknesses. “The hours are the same, and the lathe,  and also the mathematics
and my geometry lessons,” said Princess Mary gleefully , as if her
lessons in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life. When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for
the old prince to get up, Tíkhon came to call the young prince to his
father . The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor
of his son’s arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments
while he dressed for dinner . The old prince always dressed in old-
fashioned style, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair; and
when Prince Andrew entered his father ’s dressing room (not with the
contemptuous look and manner he wore  in drawing rooms, but with
the animated face with which he talked  to Pierre), the old man was
sitting on a large leather -covered chair , wrapped in a powdering
mantle, entrusting his head to Tíkhon. “Ah! here’ s the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?” said the
old man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which
Tíkhon was holding fast to plait, would allow . “You at least must tackle him properly , or else if he goes on like
this he’ll soon have us, too, for his subjects! How are you?” And he
held out his cheek. The old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner . (He
used to say that a nap “after dinner was silver—before dinner ,
golden.”) He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his
thick, bush y eyebrows. Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father
on the spot indicat ed to him. He made no reply on his father ’s
favorite topic—making fun of the military men of the day, and more
particularly of Bonaparte. “Yes, Father, I have come to you and brought my wife who is
pregnant,” said Prince Andrew , following every movement of his
father ’s face with an eager and respectful look. “How is your
health?”
“Only fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me: I am busy
from morning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well.”
“Thank God,” said his son smiling. “God has nothing to do with it! Well, go on,” he continued,
returning to his hobby; “tell me how the Germans have taught you to
fight Bonaparte by this new science you call ‘strategy .’”
Prince Andrew smiled. “Give me time to collect my wits, Father,” said he, with a smile
that show ed that his father ’s foibles did not prevent his son from6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

down!”
“Nonsense, nonsense!” cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to
see whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand. “The
house for your wife is ready . Princess Mary will take her there and
show her over, and they’ll talk nineteen to the dozen. That’ s their
woman’ s way!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
I am glad to have her.,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Sit down and talk. About
Mikhelson’ s army I understand—T olstóy‘s too... a simultaneous
expedition.... But what’ s the souther n army to do? Prussia is
neutral... I know that. What about Austria?” said he, rising from his
chair and pacing up and down the room followed by Tíkhon, who ran
after him, handing him different articles of clothing. “What of
Sweden? How will they cross Pomerania?”
Prince Andrew , seeing that his father insisted, began—at first
reluctantly , but gradually with more and more animation, and from
habit chan ging unconsciously from Russian to French as he went on
—to explain the plan of operation for the coming campaign. He
explained how an army , ninety thousand strong, was to threaten
Prussia so as to bring her out of her neutrality and draw her into the
war; how part of that army was to join some Swedish forces at
Stralsund; how two hundred and twenty thousand Austrians, with a
hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in Italy and on the
Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English were to
land at Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand men
was to attack the French from different sides. The old prince did not
evince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were not
listening to it conti nued to dress while walking about, and three
times unexpectedly interrupted. Once he stopped it by shouting:
“The white one, the white one!”
This mean t that Tíkhon was not handing him the waistcoat he
wanted. Another time he interrupted, saying:
“And will she soon be confined?” and shaking his head
reproachfully said: “That’ s bad! Go on, go on.”
The third interruption came when Prince  Andrew was finishing his
description. The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old
age: “Malbr ook s’en va-t-en guerr e. Dieu sait quand r eviendra.”  *
* “Marlborough is going to the wars; God knows when he’ll
return.”
His son only smiled. “I don’t say it’s a plan I approve of,” said the son; “I am only
telling you what it is. Napoleon has also formed his plan by now, not
worse than this one.”
“Well, you’ve told me nothing new,” and the old man repeated,
meditatively and rapidly:
“Dieu sait quand r eviendra . Go to the dining room.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

At the appointed hour the prince, powdered and shaven, entered
the dining room where his daughter -in-law , Princess Mary , and
Mademoiselle Bour ienne were already awaiting him together with
his archit ect, who by a strange caprice of his employer ’s was
admitted to table though the position of that insignificant individual
was such as could certainly not have  caused him to expect that
honor . The prince, who generally kept very strictly to social
distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials
to his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael Ivánovich (who
always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked
handkerchief) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals, and had
more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael Ivánovich
was “not a whit worse than you or I.” At dinner the prince usually
spoke to the taciturn  Michael Ivánovich more often than to anyone
else. In the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was
exceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmen—
one behind each chair—stood waiting for the prince to enter . The
head butler , napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table,
making signs to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock
to the door by whic h the prince was to enter . Prince Andrew was
looking at a large gilt frame, new to him, containing the genealogical
tree of the Princes Bolkónski, opposite which hung another such
frame with a badly painted portrait (evidently by the hand of the
artist belonging to the estate) of a ruling prince, in a crown—an
alleged descendant of Rúrik and ancest or of the Bolkónskis. Prince
Andrew , looking again at that genealo gical tree, shook his head,
laughing as a man laughs who looks at a portrait so characteristic of
the original as to be amusing. “How thoroughly like him that is!” he said to Princess Mary , who
had come up to him. Princess Mary looked at her brother in surprise. She did not
understand what he was laughing at. Everything her father did
inspired her with reverence and was beyond question. “Everyone has his Achilles’  heel,” continued Prince Andrew . “Fancy , with his powerful mind, indulging in such nonsense!”
Princess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brother ’s
criticism and was about to reply , when the expected footsteps were
heard coming from the study . The prince walked in quickly and
jauntily as was his wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness
of his manners with the strict formality of his house. At that moment
the great clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in
from the drawing room. The prince stood still; his lively glittering
eyes from under their thick, bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all
present and rested on the little prince ss. She felt, as courtiers do
when the Tsar enters, the sensation of fear and respect which the old6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

her awkwardly on the back of her neck.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“I’m glad, glad, to see you,” he said, looking attentively into her
eyes, and then quick ly went to his place and sat down. “Sit down, sit
down! Sit down, Michael Ivánovich!”
He indicat ed a place beside him to his daughter -in-law . A footman
moved the chair for her . “Ho, ho!” said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded figure. “You’ve been in a hurry . That’ s bad!”
He laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips
only and not with his eyes. “You must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible,”
he said. The little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words. She
was silent and seemed confused. The prince asked her about her
father , and she began to smile and talk. He asked about mutual
acquaintances, and she became still more animated and chattered
away giving him greetings from various people and retelling the
town gossip. “Countess Apráksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has
cried her eyes out,” she said, growing more and more lively . As she became anim ated the prince looked at her more and more
sternly , and suddenly , as if he had studied her sufficiently and had
formed a definite idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael
Ivánovich. “Well, Michael Ivánovich, our Bonapa rte will be having a bad
time of it. Prince Andrew” (he always spoke thus of his son) “has
been telling me what forces are being collected against him! While
you and I never thought much of him.”
Michael Ivánovich did not at all know when “you and I” had said
such things about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted
as a peg on which to hang the prince’ s favorite topic, he looked
inquiringly at the young prince, wondering what would follow . “He is a great tactician!” said the prince to his son, pointing to the
architect. And the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and
the generals and statesmen of the day. The old prince seemed
convinced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who
did not know the A B C of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was
an insignificant little Frenchy , successful only because there were no
longer any Potëmkins or Suvórovs left to oppose him; but he was
also convi nced that there were no political difficulties in Europe and
no real war, but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the
day were playing, pretending to do something real. Prince Andrew
gaily bore with his father ’s ridicule of the new men, and drew him on
and listened to him with evident pleasure. “The past always seems good,” said he, “but did not Suvórov
himself fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not
know how to escape?”
“Who told you that? Who?” cried the prince. “Suvórov!” And he
jerked away his plate, which Tíkhon briskly caught. “Suvórov!...6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 111/174Consider , Prince Andrew . Two...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Freder ick and Suvórov; Moreau!... Moreau would have  been a prisoner if Suvórov had had a free hand;
but he had the Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath  on his hands. It
would have puzzled the devil himself! When you get there you’ll
find out what those Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths  are! Suvórov couldn’ t
manage them so what chance has Michael Kutúzov? No, my dear
boy,” he continued,  “you and your generals won’ t get on against
Buonaparte; you’ll have to call in the French, so that birds of a
feather may fight together . The Germa n, Pahlen, has been sent to
New York in Amer ica, to fetch the Frenchman, Moreau,” he said,
alluding to the invitation made that year to Moreau to enter the
Russian service.... “Wonderful!... Were the Potëmkins, Suvórovs, and
Orlóvs Germans? No, lad, either you fellows have all lost your wits,
or I have outlived mine.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"May God help you, but we’ll see what will
happen. Buonaparte has become a great commander among them! Hm!...”
“I don’t at all say that all the plans are good,” said Prince Andrew ,
“I am only surprised  at your opinion of Bonaparte. You may laugh as
much as you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great general!”
“Michael Ivánovich !” cried the old prince to the architect who,
busy with his roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten: “Didn’ t I tell
you Buonaparte was a great tactician? Here, he says the same thing.”
“To be sure, your excellency ,” replied the architect. The prince again laughed his frigid laugh. “Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He has
got splendid soldiers. Besides he began  by attacking Germans. And
only idlers have failed to beat the Germans. Since the world began
everybody has beaten the Germans.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"They beat no one—except one
another . He made his reputation fighting them.”
And the prince bega n explaining all the blunders which, according
to him, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics. His son made no rejoinder , but it was evident that whatever
arguments were presented he was as little able as his father to change
his opinion. He listened, refraining from a reply , and involuntarily
wondered how this old man, living alone in the country for so many
years, could know and discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent
European military and political events. “You think  I’m an old man and don’t understand the present state
of affairs?” concluded his father . “But it troubles me. I don’t sleep at
night. Com e now, where has this great commander of yours shown
his skill?” he concluded. “That would take too long to tell,” answered the son. “Well, then go off to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne,
here’ s another admir er of that powder -monkey emperor of yours,” he
exclaimed in excellent French. “You know , Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!”
“Dieu sait quand reviendra.”  hummed the prince  out of tune and,
with a laugh still more so, he quitted the table. The little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the
dinner sat silent, glancing with a fright ened look now at her father -6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

her sister -in-law’ s arm and drew her into another room. “What a clever man your father is,” said she; “perhaps that is why
I am afraid of him.”
“Oh, he is so kind!” answered Princess Mary .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

Prince Andrew was to leave next evening. The old prince, not
altering his routine, retired as usual after dinner . The little princess
was in her sister -in-law’ s room. Prince Andrew in a traveling coat
without epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms
assigned to him. After inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the
trunks put in, he ordered the horses to be harnessed. Only those
things he always kept with him remaine d in his room; a small box, a
large cante en fitted with silver plate, two Turkish pistols and a saber
—a presen t from his father who had brought it from the siege of
Ochákov . All these traveling effects of Prince Andrew’ s were in very
good order: new , clean, and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes. When starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men
capable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind. At
such mom ents one reviews the past and plans for the future. Prince
Andrew’ s face looked very thoughtful and tender . With his hands
behind him he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room,
looking straight before him and though tfully shaking his head. Did
he fear going to the war, or was he sad at leaving his wife?—perhaps
both, but evidently he did not wish to be seen in that mood, for
hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands,
stopped at a table as if tying the cover of the small box, and assumed
his usual tranquil and impenetrable expression. It was the heavy
tread of Princess Mary that he heard. “I hear you have given orders to harnes s,” she cried, panting (she
had apparently been running), “and I did so wish to have another talk
with you alone! God knows how long we may again be parted. You
are not angry with me for coming? You have changed so, Andrúsha,”
she added, as if to explain such a question. She smiled as she uttered his pet name, “Andrúsha.” It was
obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man
should be Andrúsha— the slender mischievous boy who had been her
playfellow in childhood. “And where is Lise?” he asked, answering her question only by a
smile. “She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my
room. Oh, Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have,” said she,
sitting down on the sofa, facing her brother . “She is quite a child:
such a dear , merry child. I have grown so fond of her .”
Prince Andrew was silent, but the prince ss noticed the ironical and
contemptuous look that showed itself on his face. “One must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from
them, Andrew? Don’ t forget that she has grown up and been
educated in society , and so her position now is not a rosy one. We
should enter into everyone’ s situation. Tout compr endre, c’est tout
pardonner . * Think what it must be for her, poor thing, after what6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 114/174she has been used to, to be parted from her husband and be left alone
in the country , in her condition! It’ s very hard.”
* To understand all is to forgive all. Prince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister , as we smile at
those we think we thoroughly understand. “You live in the country and don’t think the life terrible,” he
replied. “I... that’s different. Why speak of me? I don’t want any other life,
and can’t, for I know no other . But think, Andrew: for a young
society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of
her life, all alone— for Papa is always busy, and I... well, you know
what poor resources  I have for entertaining a woman used to the best
society . There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne....”
“I don’t like your Mademoiselle Bour ienne at all,” said Prince
Andrew . “No?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"She is very nice and kind and, above all, she’s much to be
pitied. She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I don’t need her, and
she’s even  in my way. You know I always was a savage, and now am
even more  so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She
and Michael Ivánovich are the two people to whom he is always
gentle and kind, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As
Sterne says: ‘We don’t love people so much for the good they have
done us, as for the good we have done them.’  Father took her when
she was homeless after losing her own father . She is very good-
natured, and my father likes her way of reading. She reads to him in
the evenings and reads splendidly .”
“To be quite frank, Mary , I expect Father’s character sometimes
makes things trying for you, doesn’ t it?” Prince Andrew asked
suddenly . Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question. “For me?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
For me?...,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Trying for me!...” said she. “He alway s was rather harsh; and now I should think he’s getting
very trying ,” said Prince Andrew , apparently speaking lightly of their
father in order to puzzle or test his sister . “You are good in every way, Andrew , but you have a kind of
intellectual pride,” said the princess, following the train of her own
thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation—“and that’s a
great sin. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what
feeling except vener ation could such a man as my father evoke? And
I am so contented and happy with him. I only wish you were all as
happy as I am.”
Her brother shook his head incredulously . “The only thing that is hard for me...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"I will tell you the truth,
Andrew ... is Father ’s way of treating religious subjects. I don’t
understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is
as clear as day, and can go so far astray . That is the only thing that
makes me unhappy .","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"But even in this I can see lately a shade of
improvement. His satire has been less bitter of late, and there was a
monk he received and had a long talk with.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 115/174“Ah! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your
powder ,” said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly . “Ah! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me. Andrew ...” she said timidly after a moment’ s silence, “I have a great
favor to ask of you.”
“What is it, dear?”
“No—promise that you will not refuse! It will give you no trouble
and is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Promise,
Andrúsha!...” said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet
taking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were
the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request
was granted. She looked timidly at her brother . “Even if it were a great deal of trouble...” answered Prince
Andrew , as if guessing what it was about. “Think what you please!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"I know you are just like Father . Think as
you please, but do this for my sake!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Please do! Father ’s father , our
grandfather , wore it in all his wars.” (She still did not take out what
she was holding in her reticule.) “So you promise?”
“Of course. What is it?”
“Andrew , I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you
will never take it of f. Do you promise?”
“If it does not weigh  a hundredweight and won’ t break my neck... To please you...” said Prince Andrew . But immediately , noticing the
pained expression his joke had brought to his sister ’s face, he
repented and added: “I am glad; really , dear , I am very glad.”
“Against your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring
you to Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace,” said she in a
voice trembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands
before her brother a small, oval, antique, dark-faced icon of the
Saviour in a gold setting, on a finely wrought silver chain. She crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew . “Please, Andrew , for my sake!...”
Rays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes. Those eyes
lit up the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her
brother would have taken the icon, but she stopped him. Andrew
understood, crossed himself and kissed the icon. There was a look of
tenderness, for he was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face. “Thank you, my dear.” She kissed him on the forehead and sat
down again on the sofa. They were silent for a while. “As I was saying to you, Andrew , be kind and generous as you
always used to be. Don’ t judge Lise harshly ,” she began. “She is so
sweet, so good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one.”
“I do not think I have complained of my wife to you, Másha, or
blamed her . Why do you say all this to me?”
Red patches appeared on Princess Mary’ s face and she was silent
as if she felt guilty . “I have said nothing  to you, but you have already been talked to. And I am sorry for that,” he went on.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 116/174The patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks. She
tried to say something but could not. Her brother had guessed right:
the little princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her
forebodings about her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had
complained of her fate, her father -in-law , and her husband. After
crying she had fallen asleep. Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister . “Know this, Másha: I can’t reproach, have not reproached, and
never shall reproach my wife with anything, and I cannot reproach
myself with anything in regard to her; and that always will be so in
whatever circumstances I may be place d. But if you want to know
the truth... if you want to know whether I am happy? No! Is she
happy? No! But why this is so I don’ t know ...”
As he said this he rose, went to his sister , and, stooping, kissed her
forehead. His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly , and
unaccustomed brigh tness, but he was looking not at his sister but
over her head toward the darkness of the open doorway . “Let us go to her, I must say good-by . Or—go and wake and I’ll
come in a moment. Petrúshka!” he called to his valet: “Come here,
take these away . Put this on the seat and this to the right.”
Princess Mary rose and moved to the door, then stopped and said:
“Andrew , if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked
Him to give you the love you do not feel, and your prayer would
have been answered.”
“Well, maybe!” said Prince Andrew . “Go, Másha; I’ll come
immediately .”
On the way to his sister ’s room, in the passage which connected
one wing with the other , Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle
Bourienne smiling sweetly . It was the third time that day that, with
an ecstatic and artless smile, she had met him in secluded passages.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“Oh! I thought you were in your room,” she said, for some reason
blushing and dropping her eyes. Prince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger
suddenly came over his face. He said nothing to her but looked at her
forehead and hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt
that the Frenchwoman blushed and went  away without a word. When
he reache d his sister ’s room his wife was already awake and her
merry voice, hurrying one word after another , came through the open
door. She was speaking as usual in French, and as if after long self-
restraint she wished to make up for lost time. “No, but imagine the old Countess Zúbova, with false curls and
her mouth full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old age.... Ha, ha, ha! Mary!”
This very sentence about Countess Zúbova and this same laugh
Prince Andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of
others some five times. He entered the room softly . The little
princess, plump and rosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work
in her hands, talking incessantly , repeati ng Petersbur g reminiscences
and even phrases. Prince Andrew came up, stroked her hair, and
asked if she felt rested after their journey . She answered him and
continued her chatter . The coach with six horses was waiting at the porch. It was an
autumn night, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 117/174pole. Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch. The
immense house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty
windows. The domestic serfs were crow ding in the hall, waiting to
bid good- by to the young prince. The members of the household
were all gathered in the reception hall: Michael Ivánovich,
Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess Mary , and the little princess. Prince Andrew had been called to his father ’s study as the latter
wished to say good-by to him alone. All were waiting for them to
come out. When Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age
spectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but
his son, sat at the table writing. He glanced round.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“Going?” And he went on writing. “I’ve come to say good-by .”
“Kiss me here,” and he touched his cheek: “Thanks, thanks!”
“What do you thank me for?”
“For not dilly-dallying and not hang ing to a woman’ s apron
strings. The Service before everything. Thanks, thanks!” And he
went on writing, so that his quill splut tered and squeaked. “If you
have anyth ing to say, say it. These two things can be done together ,”
he added. “About my wife... I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your
hands....”
“Why talk nonsense? Say what you want.”
“When her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an
accoucheur .... Let him be here....”
The old prince stopp ed writing and, as if not understanding, fixed
his stern eyes on his son. “I know that no one can help if nature does not do her work,” said
Prince Andrew , evidently confused. “I know that out of a million
cases only one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"They have
been telling her things. She has had a dream and is frightened.”
“Hm... Hm...” muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what
he was writing. “I’ll do it.”
He signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to
laugh. “It’s a bad business, eh?”
“What is bad, Father?”
“The wife!” said the old prince, briefly and significantly . “I don’ t understand!” said Prince Andrew . “No, it can’t be helped, lad,” said the prince. “They’re all like that;
one can’t unmarry . Don’ t be afraid; I won’ t tell anyone, but you
know it yourself.”
He seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it,
looked straight into his son’s face with keen eyes which seemed to
see through him, and again laughed his frigid laugh. The son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him. The old man contin ued to fold and seal his letter , snatching up and
throwing down the wax, the seal, and the paper , with his accustomed
rapidity .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 118/174“What’ s to be done? She’s pretty!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"I will do everything. Make your
mind easy ,” said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter . Andrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that his
father understood him. The old man got up and gave the letter to his
son. “Listen!” said he; “don’t worry about your wife: what can be done
shall be. Now listen! Give this letter to Michael Ilariónovich. * I
have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not
keep you long as an adjutant: a bad position! Tell him I remember
and like him. Write and tell me how he receives you. If he is all right
—serve him. Nicholas Bolkónski’ s son need not serve under anyone
if he is in disfavor . Now come here.”
* Kutúzov. He spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his
son was accustome d to understand him. He led him to the desk,
raised the lid, drew out a drawer , and took out an exercise book filled
with his bold, tall, close handwriting. “I shall probably die before you. So remember , these are my
memoirs; hand them to the Emperor after my death. Now here is a
Lombard bond and a letter; it is a premi um for the man who writes a
history of Suvórov’ s wars. Send it to the Academy .","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Here are some
jottings for you to read when I am gone. You will find them useful.”
Andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long
time yet. He felt that he must not say it.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“I will do it all, Father ,” he said. “Well, now, good-by!” He gave his son his hand to kiss, and
embraced him. “Remember this, Prince Andrew , if they kill you it
will hurt me, your old father ...” he paused unexpectedly , and then in
a querulous voice suddenly shrieked: “but if I hear that you have not
behaved like a son of Nicholas Bolkónski, I shall be ashamed!”
“You need  not have said that to me, Father ,” said the son with a
smile. The old man was silent. “I also wanted to ask you,” continued Prince Andrew , “if I’m
killed and if I have a son, do not let him be taken away from you—as
I said yesterday ... let him grow up with you.... Please.”
“Not let the wife have him?” said the old man, and laughed. They stood silent, facing one another . The old man’ s sharp eyes
were fixed  straight on his son’s. Something twitched in the lower
part of the old prince’ s face. “We’ve said good-by . Go!” he suddenly  shouted in a loud, angry
voice, opening his door . “What is it? What? ” asked both princesses when they saw for a
moment at the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a
white dressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry
voice. Prince Andrew sighed and made no reply . “Well!” he said, turning to his wife.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 119/174And this “Well!” sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying:
“Now go through your performance.”
“Andrew , already!” said the little princess, turning pale and
looking with dismay at her husband. He embraced her.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"She screamed and fell unconscious on his
shoulder . He cautiou sly released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her
face, and carefully placed her in an easy chair . “Adieu, Mary ,” said he gently to his sister , taking her by the hand
and kissing her , and then he left the room with rapid steps. The little princess lay in the armchair , Mademoiselle Bourienne
chafing her temples. Princess Mary , supporting her sister -in-law , still
looked with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which
Prince Andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his
direction. From the study , like pistol shots, came the frequent sound
of the old man angrily blowing his nose. Hardly had Prince Andrew
gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of the
old man in the white dressing gown looked out.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“Gone? That’s all right!” said he; and looking angrily at the
unconscious little princess, he shook his head reprovingly and
slammed the door .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

In Octobe r, 1805, a Russian army was occupying the villages and
towns of the Archduchy of Austria, and yet other regiments freshly
arriving from Russia were settling near the fortress of Braunau and
burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered. Braunau
was the headquarters of the commander in chief, Kutúzov . On October 11, 1805, one of the infant ry regiments that had just
reached Braunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be
inspected by the commander in chief. Despite the un-Russian
appearance of the locality and surroun dings—fruit gardens, stone
fences, tiled roofs, and hills in the distan ce—and despite the fact that
the inhabitants (who gazed with curios ity at the soldiers) were not
Russians, the regiment had just the appearance of any Russian
regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia. On the evening of the last day’s march an order had been received
that the commande r in chief would inspect the regiment on the
march. Though the words of the order were not clear to the
regimental commander , and the question arose whether the troops
were to be in marching order or not, it was decided at a consultation
between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade
order , on the princip le that it is always better to “bow too low than
not bow low enoug h.” So the soldiers, after a twenty-mile march,
were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their
eyes, while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and
reckoned, and by morning the regiment—instead of the straggling,
disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day before—
presented a well-ordered array of two thousand men each of whom
knew his place and his duty, had every button and every strap in
place, and shone with cleanliness. And not only externally was all in
order , but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the
uniforms he would have found on every man a clean shirt, and in
every knapsack the appointed number of articles, “awl, soap, and
all,” as the soldiers say. There was only one circumstance concerning
which no one could be at ease. It was the state of the soldiers’  boots. More than half the men’ s boots were in holes. But this defect was not
due to any fault of the regimental commander , for in spite of
repeated demands boots had not been issued by the Austrian
commissariat, and the regiment had marched some seven hundred
miles. The commander of the regiment was an elderly , choleric, stout,
and thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and
wider from  chest to back than across the shoulders. He had on a
brand-new uniform showing the crease s where it had been folded
and thick gold epaulettes which seemed  to stand rather than lie down
on his massive shoulders. He had the air of a man happily
performing one of the most solemn duties of his life. He walked
about in front of the line and at every step pulled himself up, slightly6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 122/174arching his back. It was plain that the commander admired his
regiment, rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was engrossed by it,
yet his strut seemed to indicate that, besides military matters, social
interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his thoughts. “Well, Michael Mítrich, sir?” he said, addressing one of the
battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward (it was plain
that they both felt happy). “We had our hands full last night. However , I think the regiment is not a bad one, eh?”
The battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed. “It would not be turned off the field even on the Tsarítsin
Meadow .”
“What?” asked the commander . At that moment, on the road from the town on which signalers had
been posted, two men appeared on horse back. They were an aide-
de-camp followed by a Cossack. The aide-d e-camp was sent to confirm  the order which had not
been clearly worded the day before, namely , that the commander in
chief wish ed to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been
on the march: in their greatcoats, and packs, and without any
preparation whatever . A member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kutúzov
the day before with proposals and demands for him to join up with
the army of the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and Kutúzov , not
considering this junction advisable, meant, among other arguments
in support of his view , to show the Austrian general the wretched
state in which the troops arrived from  Russia. With this object he
intended to meet the regiment; so the worse the condition it was in,
the better pleased the commander in chief would be. Though the
aide-de-camp did not know these circumstances, he nevertheless
delivered the definite order that the men should be in their greatcoats
and in marching order, and that the commander in chief would
otherwise be dissatisfied. On hearing this the regimental commander
hung his head, silen tly shrugged his shoulders, and spread out his
arms with a choleric gesture. “A fine mess we’ve made of it!” he remarked. “There now! Didn’ t I tell you, Michael Mítrich, that if it was said
‘on the march’  it meant in greatcoats?” said he reproachfully to the
battalion commander . “Oh, my God!” he added, stepping resolutely
forward. “Company commanders!” he shouted in a voice
accustomed to command. “Sergeants major!... How soon will he be
here?” he asked the aide-de-camp with a respectful politeness
evidently relating to the personage he was referring to. “In an hour ’s time, I should say .”
“Shall we have time to change clothes?”
“I don’ t know , General....”
The regimental commander , going up to the line himself, ordered
the soldiers to change into their greatcoats. The company
commanders ran off to their companies , the sergeants major began
bustling (the greatcoats were not in very good condition), and
instantly the square s that had up to then been in regular order and
silent bega n to sway and stretch and hum with voices. On all sides6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 123/174soldiers were running to and fro, throwing up their knapsacks with a
jerk of their shoul ders and pulling the straps over their heads,
unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on with upraised
arms. In half an hour all was again in order , only the squares had become
gray inste ad of black. The regimental commander walked with his
jerky steps to the front of the regiment and examined it from a
distance. “Whatever is this? This!” he shouted and stood still. “Commander
of the third company!”
“Commander of the third company wanted by the general!... commander to the general... third company to the commander .” The
words passed along  the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the
missing of ficer. When the eager but misrepeated words had reached their
destination in a cry of: “The general to the third company ,” the
missing officer appeared from behind his company and, though he
was a middle-aged  man and not in the habit of running, trotted
awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the general. The captain’ s
face show ed the uneasiness of a schoo lboy who is told to repeat a
lesson he has not learned. Spots appeared on his nose, the redness of
which was evidently due to intemperan ce, and his mouth twitched
nervously . The general looked the captain up and down as he came
up panting, slackening his pace as he approached. “You will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What is this?”
shouted the regimental commander , thrusting forward his jaw and
pointing at a soldier  in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat
of bluish cloth, which contrasted with the others. “What have you
been after? The commander in chief is expected and you leave your
place? Eh? I’ll teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a
parade.... Eh...?”
The commander of the company , with his eyes fixed on his
superior , pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if
in this pressure lay his only hope of salvation. “Well, why don’t you speak? Whom have you got there dressed up
as a Hungarian?” said the commander with an austere gibe. “Your excellency ...”
“Well, your excellency , what?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
Your excellency!,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"But what about
your excellency?... nobody knows.”
“Your excellency , it’s the officer Dólokh ov, who has been reduced
to the ranks,” said the captain softly . “Well? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a
soldier? If a soldier , he should be dressed in regulation uniform like
the others.”
“Your excellency , you gave him leave yourself, on the march.”
“Gave him leave? Leave? That’ s just like you young men,” said
the regimental commander cooling down a little. “Leave indeed.... One says a word to you and you... What?” he added with renewed
irritation, “I beg you to dress your men decently .”
And the commande r, turning to look at the adjutant, directed his
jerky steps down the line. He was evidently pleased at his own6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 124/174display of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a
further excuse for wrath. Having snapped at an officer for an
unpolished badge, at another because his line was not straight, he
reached the third company . “H-o-o-w are you standing? Where’ s your leg? Your leg?” shouted
the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice, while there
were still five men between him and Dólokhov with his bluish-gray
uniform. Dólokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight with
his clear , insolent eyes in the general’ s face. “Why a blue coat? Off with it... Sergeant major! Change his coat... the ras...” he did not finish. “General, I must obey orders, but I am not bound to endure...”
Dólokhov hurriedly interrupted. “No talking in the ranks!... No talking, no talking!”
“Not bound to endure insults,” Dólokhov concluded in loud,
ringing tones. The eyes of the general and the soldier  met. The general became
silent, angrily pulling down his tight scarf. “I request you to have the goodness to change your coat,” he said
as he turned away .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

“He’ s coming!” shouted the signaler at that moment. The regimental commander , flushing, ran to his horse, seized the
stirrup with trembling hands, threw his body across the saddle,
righted himself, drew his saber , and with a happy and resolute
countenance, opening his mouth awry , prepared to shout. The
regiment fluttered like a bird preenin g its plumage and became
motionless. “Att-ention!” shoute d the regimental commander in a soul-shaking
voice whic h expressed joy for himself, severity for the regiment, and
welcome for the approaching chief. Along the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came
a high, light blue Viennese calèche , slightly creaking on its springs
and drawn by six horses at a smart trot. Behind the calèche  galloped
the suite and a convoy of Croats. Beside Kutúzov sat an Austrian
general, in a white uniform that looked strange among the Russian
black ones. The calèche  stopped in front of the regiment. Kutú zov
and the Austrian general were talking in low voices and Kutúzov
smiled slightly as treading heavily he stepped down from the
carriage just as if those two thousand men breathlessly gazing at him
and the regimental commander did not exist. The word of command rang out, and again the regiment quivered,
as with a jingling sound it presented arms. Then amidst a dead
silence the feeble voice of the commander in chief was heard. The
regiment roared, “Health to your ex... len...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"len... lency!” and again
all becam e silent. At first Kutúzov stood still while the regiment
moved; then he and the general in white, accompanied by the suite,
walked between the ranks. From the way the regimental commander saluted the commander
in chief and devou red him with his eyes, drawing himself up
obsequiously , and from the way he walk ed through the ranks behind
the generals, bending forward and hardly able to restrain his jerky
movements, and from the way he darte d forward at every word or
gesture of the commander in chief, it was evident that he performed
his duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal than his duty as a
commander . Thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander
the regime nt, in comparison with others  that had reached Braunau at
the same time, was in splendid conditio n. There were only 217 sick
and stragglers. Everything was in good order except the boots. Kutúzov walked through the ranks, sometimes stopping to say a
few friendly words to officers he had known in the Turkish war,
sometimes also to the soldiers. Lookin g at their boots he several
times shoo k his head sadly , pointing them out to the Austrian general
with an expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming
anyone, but could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was. The regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion,
fearing to miss a single word of the commander in chief ’s regarding6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 126/174the regime nt. Behind Kutúzov , at a distance that allowed every softly
spoken word to be heard, followed some twenty men of his suite. These gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed. Nearest of all to the commander in chief walked a handsome
adjutant. This was Prince Bolkónski. Beside him was his comrade
Nesvítski, a tall staff officer, extremely stout, with a kindly , smiling,
handsome face and moist eyes. Nesvítski could hardly keep from
laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar  officer who walked beside
him. This hussar , with a grave face and without a smile or a change
in the expression of his fixed eyes, watched the regimental
commander ’s back and mimicked his every movement. Each time
the commander started and bent forward, the hussar started and bent
forward in exactly the same manner . Nesvítski laughed and nudged
the others to make them look at the wag. Kutúzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes
which were starting from their socke ts to watch their chief. On
reaching the third company he sudde nly stopped. His suite, not
having expected this, involuntarily came closer to him. “Ah, Timókhin!” said he, recognizing the red-nosed captain who
had been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat. One would  have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself
more than Timókhin had done when he was reprimanded by the
regimental commander , but now that the commander in chief
addressed him he drew himself up to such an extent that it seemed he
could not have sustained it had the commander in chief continued to
look at him, and so Kutúzov , who evide ntly understood his case and
wished him nothing but good, quickly turned away , a scarcely
perceptible smile flitting over his scarred and puf fy face. “Another Ismail comrade,” said he. “A brave officer! Are you
satisfied with him?” he asked the regimental commander . And the latter—unc onscious that he was being reflected in the
hussar officer as in a looking glass—started, moved forward, and
answered: “Highly satisfied, your excellency!”
“We all have our weaknesses,” said Kutúzov smiling and walking
away from him. “He used to have a predilection for Bacchus.”
The regim ental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this
and did not answer . The hussar at that moment noticed the face of the
red-nosed captain and his drawn-in stomach, and mimicked his
expression and pose with such exactitude that Nesvítski could not
help laughing. Kutúzov turned round. The officer evidently had
complete control of his face, and while Kutúzov was turning
managed to make a grimace and then assume a most serious,
deferential, and innocent expression. The third company was the last, and Kutúzov pondered,
apparently trying to recollect somethi ng. Prince Andrew stepped
forward from among the suite and said in French:
“You told me to remind you of the officer Dólokhov , reduced to
the ranks in this regiment.”
“Where is Dólokhov?” asked Kutúzov . Dólokhov , who had already changed into a soldier ’s gray
greatcoat, did not wait to be called. The shapely figure of the fair-6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 127/174haired soldier, with his clear blue eyes, stepped forward from the
ranks, went up to the commander in chief, and presented arms. “Have you a comp laint to make?” Kutúzov asked with a slight
frown.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“This is Dólokhov ,” said Prince Andrew . “Ah!” said Kutúzov . “I hope this will be a lesson to you.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Do your
duty. The Emperor is gracious, and I shan’ t forget you if you deserve
well.”
The clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as
boldly as they had looked at the regimental commander , seeming by
their expre ssion to tear open the veil of convention that separates a
commander in chief so widely from a private. “One thing I ask of your excellency ,” Dólokhov said in his firm,
ringing, deliberate voice. “I ask an opportunity to atone for my fault
and prove my devotion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia!”
Kutúzov turned away . The same smile of the eyes with which he
had turned from Captain Timókhin again flitted over his face. He
turned away with a grimace as if to say that everything Dólokhov
had said to him and everything he could say had long been known to
him, that he was weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted. He
turned away and went to the carriage. The regiment broke up into companies, which went to their
appointed quarters near Braunau, where  they hoped to receive boots
and clothes and to rest after their hard marches. “You won’t bear me a grudge, Prokhór Ignátych?” said the
regimental commander , overtaking the third company on its way to
its quarters and riding up to Captain Timókhin who was walking in
front. (The regimental commander ’s face now that the inspection
was happily over beamed with irrepressible delight.) “It’s in the
Emperor ’s service... it can’t be helped...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"one is sometimes a bit hasty
on parade... I am the first to apologize, you know me!... He was very
pleased!” And he held out his hand to the captain. “Don’ t mention it, General, as if I’d be so bold!” replied the
captain, his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed
where two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the
butt end of a gun at Ismail. “And tell Mr. Dólokhov that I won’ t forget him—he may be quite
easy. And tell me, please—I’ve been meaning to ask—how is he
behaving himself, and in general...”
“As far as the service goes he is quite punctilious, your
excellency; but his character ...” said Timókhin. “And what about his character?” asked the regimental commander . “It’s different on different days,” answered the captain. “One day
he is sensible, well educated, and good -natured, and the next he’s a
wild beast.... In Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a Jew .”
“Oh, well, well!” remarked the regimental commander . “Still, one
must have pity on a young man in misfortune. You know he has
important connections... Well, then, you just...”
“I will, your excellency ,” said Timókh in, showing by his smile
that he understood his commander ’s wish.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 128/174“Well, of course, of course!”
The regim ental commander sought out Dólokhov in the ranks and,
reining in his horse, said to him:
“After the next af fair... epaulettes.”
Dólokhov looked round but did not say anything, nor did the
mocking smile on his lips change. “Well, that’s all right,” continued the regimental commander . “A
cup of vodka for the men from me,” he added so that the soldiers
could hear. “I thank you all! God be praised!” and he rode past that
company and overtook the next one. “Well, he’s really a good fellow , one can serve under him,” said
Timókhin to the subaltern beside him. “In a word, a hearty one...” said the subaltern, laughing (the
regimental commander was nicknamed King of Hearts ). The cheer ful mood of their officers after the inspection infected
the soldiers. The company marched on gaily . The soldiers’  voices
could be heard on every side. “And they said Kutúzov was blind of one eye?”
“And so he is! Quite blind!”
“No, frien d, he is sharper -eyed than you are. Boots and leg
bands... he noticed everything...”
“When he looked at my feet, friend... well, thinks I...”
“And that other one with him, the Austrian, looked as if he were
smeared with chalk—as white as flour! I suppose they polish him up
as they do the guns.”
“I say, Fédeshon!... Did he say when the battles are to begin? You
were near him. Everybody said that Buonaparte himself was at
Braunau.”
“Buonaparte himsel f!... Just listen to the fool, what he doesn’ t
know! The Prussian s are up in arms now. The Austrians, you see, are
putting them down. When they’ve been put down, the war with
Buonaparte will begin. And he says Buonaparte is in Braunau! Shows you’re a fool. You’d better listen more carefully!”
“What devils these quartermasters are! See, the fifth company is
turning into the village already ... they will have their buckwheat
cooked before we reach our quarters.”
“Give me a biscuit, you devil!”
“And did you give me tobacco yesterd ay? That’ s just it, friend! Ah, well, never mind, here you are.”
“They might call a halt here or we’ll have to do another four miles
without eating.”
“Wasn’t it fine when those Germans gave us lifts! You just sit still
and are drawn along.”
“And here, friend, the people are quite  beggarly . There they all
seemed to be Poles— all under the Russian crown—but here they’re
all regular Germans.”
“Singers to the front” came the captain’ s order . And from the different ranks some twen ty men ran to the front. A
drummer , their leader , turned round facing the singers, and6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 129/174flourishing his arm, began a long-drawn-out soldiers’  song,
commencing with the words: “Morning dawned, the sun was
rising,”  and conc luding: “On then, brothers, on to glory , led by
Father Kámenski.”  This song had been composed in the Turkish
campaign and now being sung in Austria, the only change being that
the words “Father Kámenski” were replaced by “Father Kutúzov .”
Having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his
arms as if flinging something to the ground, the drummer—a lean,
handsome soldier of forty—looked stern ly at the singers and screwed
up his eyes. Then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on
him, he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but
precious object above his head and, holding it there for some
seconds, suddenly flung it down and began:
“Oh, my bower , oh, my bower ...!”
“Oh, my bower new...!” chimed in twenty voices, and the castan et
player , in spite of the burden of his equipment, rushed out to the
front and, walking backwards before the company , jerked his
shoulders and flourished his castanets as if threatening someone.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"The
soldiers, swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously ,
marched with long steps. Behind the company the sound of wheels,
the creaking of springs, and the tramp of horses’  hoofs were heard. Kutúzov and his suite were returning to the town. The commander in
chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease, and
he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and
the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching
men. In the second  file from the right flank, beside which the
carriage passed the company , a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily
attracted notice. It was Dólokhov marching with particular grace and
boldness in time to the song and looking  at those driving past as if he
pitied all who were not at that moment marching with the company . The hussar cornet of Kutúzov’ s suite who had mimicked the
regimental commander , fell back from the carriage and rode up to
Dólokhov . Hussar cornet Zherkóv had at one time, in Petersbur g, belonged to
the wild set led by Dólokhov . Zherkóv had met Dólokhov abroad as
a private and had not seen fit to recognize him. But now that
Kutúzov had spoken to the gentleman ranker , he addressed him with
the cordiality of an old friend. “My dear fellow , how are you?” said he through the singing,
making his horse keep pace with the company . “How am I?” Dólokhov answered coldly . “I am as you see.”
The lively  song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy
gaiety with which Zherkóv spoke, and to the intentional coldness of
Dólokhov’ s reply . “And how do you get on with the of ficers?” inquired Zherkóv . “All right. They are good fellows. And how have you wriggled
onto the staf f?”
“I was attached; I’m on duty .”
Both were silent. “She let the hawk fly upwar d from her wide right sleeve,”  went  the
song, arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 130/174Their conversation would probably have been different but for the
effect of that song. “Is it true that Austrians have been beaten?” asked Dólokhov . “The devil only knows! They say so.”
“I’m glad,” answered Dólokhov briefly  and clearly , as the song
demanded. “I say, come round some evening and we’ll have a game of faro!”
said Zherkóv . “Why , have you too much money?”
“Do come.”
“I can’t.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"I’ve sworn not to. I won’ t drink and won’ t play till I get
reinstated.”
“Well, that’ s only till the first engagement.”
“We shall see.”
They were again silent. “Come if you need anything. One can at least be of use on the
staff...”
Dólokhov smiled. “Don’ t trouble.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"If I want anything, I won’ t beg
—I’ll take it!”
“Well, never mind; I only ...”
“And I only ...”
“Good-by .”
“Good health...”
“It’s a long, long way. To my native land...”
Zherkóv touched his horse with the spurs; it pranced excitedly
from foot to foot uncertain with which to start, then settled down,
galloped past the company , and overtook the carriage, still keeping
time to the song.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

On returning from the review , Kutúzov took the Austrian general
into his private room and, calling his adjutant, asked for some papers
relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival, and the letters
that had come from  the Archduke Ferdi nand, who was in command
of the advanced army. Prince Andrew Bolkónski came into the room
with the required papers. Kutúzov and the Austrian member of the
Hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread
out. “Ah!...” said Kutúzov glancing at Bolkónski as if by this
exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with
the conversation in French. “All I can say, General,” said he with a pleasant elegance of
expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each
deliberately spoken word. It was evident that Kutúzov himself
listened with pleasure to his own voice. “All I can say, General, is
that if the matter depended on my personal wishes, the will of His
Majesty the Emperor Francis would have been fulfilled long ago.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"I
should long ago have joined the archd uke. And believe me on my
honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the
supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed
and more skillful general—of whom Austria has so many—and to
lay down all this heavy responsibility . But circumstances are
sometimes too strong for us, General.”
And Kutúzov smiled in a way that seem ed to say, “You are quite at
liberty not to believe  me and I don’t even care whether you do or not,
but you have no grounds for telling me so. And that is the whole
point.”
The Austr ian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to
reply in the same tone. “On the contrary ,” he said, in a queru lous and angry tone that
contrasted with his flattering words, “on the contrary , your
excellency’ s participation in the common action is highly valued by
His Majes ty; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid
Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been
accustomed to win in their battles,” he concluded his evidently
prearranged sentence. Kutúzov bowed with the same smile. “But that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with
which His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I
imagine that the Austrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a
leader as General Mack, have by now already gained a decisive
victory and no longer need our aid,” said Kutúzov . The gener al frowned. Though there was no definite news of an
Austrian defeat, there were many circumstances confirming the
unfavorable rumors that were afloat, and so Kutúzov’ s suggestion of6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 132/174an Austrian victory sounded much like irony . But Kutúzov went on
blandly smiling with the same expressio n, which seemed to say that
he had a right to suppose so. And, in fact, the last letter he had
received from Mack’ s army informed him of a victory and stated
strategically the position of the army was very favorable. “Give me that letter ,” said Kutúzov turning to Prince Andrew . “Please have a look at it”—and Kutúzov  with an ironical smile about
the corner s of his mouth read to the Austrian general the following
passage, in German, from the Archduke Ferdinand’ s letter:
We have fully conce ntrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men
with which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech. Also, as we are masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived of the
advantage of commanding both sides of the Danube, so that should
the enemy not cross the Lech, we can cross the Danube, throw
ourselves on his line of communicatio ns, recross the river lower
down, and frustrate his intention shoul d he try to direct his whole
force against our faithful ally. We shall therefore confidently await
the moment when the Imperial Russian army will be fully equipped,
and shall then, in conjunction with it, easily find a way to prepare for
the enemy the fate he deserves. Kutúzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at
the member of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively . “But you know the wise maxim your excellency , advising one to
expect the worst,” said the Austrian general, evidently wishing to
have done  with jests and to come to business. He involuntarily
looked round at the aide-de-camp. “Excuse me, General,” interrupted Kutúzov , also turning to Prince
Andrew . “Look here, my dear fellow , get from Kozlóvski all the
reports from our scouts. Here are two letters from Count Nostitz and
here is one from His Highness the Arch duke Ferdinand and here are
these,” he said, handing him several papers, “make a neat
memorandum in French out of all this, showing all the news we have
had of the movements of the Austrian army , and then give it to his
excellency .”
Prince Andrew bowed his head in token of having understood
from the first not only what had been said but also what Kutúzov
would have liked to tell him. He gathered up the papers and with a
bow to both, stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the
waiting room. Though not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left
Russia, he had changed greatly during that period. In the expression
of his face, in his movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of
his former affected languor and indolence. He now looked like a man
who has time to think of the impression he makes on others, but is
occupied with agreeable and interesting work. His face expressed
more satisfaction with himself and those around him, his smile and
glance were brighter and more attractive. Kutúzov , whom he had overtaken in Poland, had received him
very kindl y, promised not to forget him, distinguished him above the
other adjutants, and had taken him to Vienna and given him the more
serious commissions. From Vienna Kutúzov wrote to his old
comrade, Prince Andrew’ s father .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 133/174Your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his
industry , firmness, and expedition. I consider myself fortunate to
have such a subordinate by me. On Kutúz ov’s staff, among his fellow  officers and in the army
generally , Prince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersbur g society ,
two quite opposite reputations. Some, a minority , acknowledged him
to be different from themselves and from everyone else, expected
great things of him, listened to him, admired, and imitated him, and
with them Prince Andrew was natural and pleasant. Others, the
majority , disliked him and considered him conceited, cold, and
disagreeable. But among these people Prince Andrew knew how to
take his stand so that they respected and even feared him. Coming out of Kutúzov’ s room into the waiting room with the
papers in his hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade, the aide-
de-camp on duty, Kozlóvski, who was sitting at the window with a
book. “Well, Prince?” asked Kozlóvski. “I am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not
advancing.”
“And why is it?”
Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders. “Any news from Mack?”
“No.”
“If it were true that he has been beaten, news would have come.”
“Probably ,” said Prince Andrew moving toward the outer door . But at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat, with the
order of Maria Theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his
head, who had evidently just arrived, entered quickly , slamming the
door. Prince Andrew stopped short. “Commander in Chief Kutúzov?” said the newly arrived general
speaking quickly with a harsh German accent, looking to both sides
and advancing straight toward the inner door . “The commander in chief is engaged,” said Kozlóvski, going
hurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the
door. “Whom shall I announce?”
The unknown general looked disdainfully down at Kozlóvski, who
was rather short, as if surprised that anyone should not know him. “The commander in chief is engaged,” repeated Kozlóvski calmly . The general’ s face clouded, his lips quivered and trembled. He
took out a notebook,  hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out
the leaf, gave it to Kozlóvski, stepped quickly to the window , and
threw himself into a chair , gazing at those in the room as if asking,
“Why do they look at me?” Then he lifted his head, stretched his
neck as if he intended to say something, but immediately , with
affected indifference, began to hum to himself, producing a queer
sound which immediately broke off. The door of the private room
opened and Kutúzov appeared in the doorway . The general with the
bandaged head bent forward as though running away from some
danger , and, making  long, quick strides with his thin legs, went up to
Kutúzov .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 134/174“Vous voyez le malheur eux Mack,”  he uttered in a broken voice. Kutúzov’ s face as he stood in the open doorway remained
perfectly immobile for a few moments. Then wrinkles ran over his
face like a wave and his forehead became smooth again, he bowed
his head respectfull y, closed his eyes,  silently let Mack enter his
room before him, and closed the door himself behind him. The report  which had been circulated that the Austrians had been
beaten and that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to be
correct. Within half an hour adjutant s had been sent in various
directions with orders which showed that the Russian troops, who
had hitherto been inactive, would also soon have to meet the enemy . Prince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief
interest lay in the general progress of the war. When he saw Mack
and heard the details of his disaster he understood that half the
campaign was lost, understood all the difficulties of the Russian
army’ s position, and vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he
would have to play. Involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the
thought of the humiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a week’ s
time he might, perhaps, see and take part in the first Russian
encounter with the French since Suvór ov met them. He feared that
Bonaparte’ s genius might outweigh all the courage of the Russian
troops, and at the same time could not admit the idea of his hero
being disgraced. Excited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew went
toward his room to write to his father , to whom he wrote every day. In the corridor he met Nesvítski, with whom he shared a room, and
the wag Zherkóv; they were as usual laughing. “Why are you so glum?” asked Nesvítski noticing Prince
Andrew’ s pale face and glittering eyes. “There’ s nothing to be gay about,” answered Bolkónski. Just as Prince Andrew met Nesvítski and Zherkóv , there came
toward them from the other end of the corridor , Strauch, an Austrian
general who was on Kutúzov’ s staff in charge of the provisioning of
the Russian army , and the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had
arrived the previous evening. There was room enough in the wide
corridor for the generals to pass the three officers quite easily , but
Zherkóv , pushing Nesvítski aside with his arm, said in a breathless
voice,
“They’re coming!... they’re coming!... Stand aside, make way,
please make way!”
The generals were passing by, looking as if they wished to avoid
embarrassing attent ions. On the face of the wag Zherkóv there
suddenly appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to
suppress. “Your excellency ,” said he in German, stepping forward and
addressing the Austrian general, “I have the honor to congratulate
you.”
He bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with
the other , awkwardly , like a child at a dancing lesson. The member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but,
seeing the seriousne ss of his stupid smile, could not but give him a6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

listening.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“I have the honor to congratulate you. General Mack has arrived,
quite well, only a little bruised just here,” he added, pointing with a
beaming smile to his head. The general frowned, turned away , and went on. “Gott, wie naiv!”  * said he angrily , after he had gone a few steps. * “Good God, what simplicity!”
Nesvítski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew , but
Bolkónski, turning still paler , pushed him away with an angry look
and turned to Zherkóv . The nervous irritation aroused by the
appearance of Mack, the news of his defeat, and the thought of what
lay before  the Russian army found vent in anger at Zherkóv’ s
untimely jest. “If you, sir, choose to make a buffoon  of yourself,” he said sharply ,
with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, “I can’t prevent your doing
so; but I warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my presence, I
will teach you to behave yourself.”
Nesvítski and Zherkóv were so surprised  by this outburst that they
gazed at Bolkónski silently with wide-open eyes. “What’ s the matter? I only congratulated them,” said Zherkóv . “I am not jesting with you; please be silent!” cried Bolkónski, and
taking Nesvítski’ s arm he left Zherkóv , who did not know what to
say. “Come, what’ s the matter , old fellow? ” said Nesvítski trying to
soothe him. “What’ s the matter?” exclaimed Prince Andrew standing still in
his excite ment. “Don’ t you understand that either we are officers
serving our Tsar and our country , rejoicing in the successes and
grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause, or we are merely
lackeys who care nothing for their maste r’s business. Quarante mille
hommes massacrés et l’armée de nos alliés détruite, et vous trouvez
là le mot pour rire,” * he said, as if strengthening his views  by this
French sentence. “C’est bien pour un garçon de rien comme cet
individu dont vous avez fait un ami, mais pas pour vous, pas pour
vous. *(2) Only a hobbledehoy  could amuse himse lf in this way,” he
added in Russian—b ut pronouncing the word with a French accent—
having noticed that Zherkóv could still hear him. * “Forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies
destroyed, and you find that a cause for jesting!”
* (2) “It is all very well for that good-for-nothing fellow of
whom you have made a friend, but not for you, not for you.”
He waited a momen t to see whether the cornet would answer , but
he turned and went out of the corridor .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

The Pávlograd Hussars were stationed two miles from Braunau. The squadron in which Nicholas Rostóv served as a cadet was
quartered in the German village of Salzeneck. The best quarters in
the village were assigned to cavalry-captain Denísov , the squadron
commander , known throughout the whole cavalry division as Váska
Denísov . Cadet Rostóv , ever since he had overtaken the regiment in
Poland, had lived with the squadron commander . On October 11, the day when all was astir at headquarters over the
news of Mack’ s defeat, the camp life of the officers of this squadron
was proceeding as usual. Denísov , who had been losing at cards all
night, had not yet come home when Rostóv rode back early in the
morning from a foraging expedition. Rostóv in his cadet uniform,
with a jerk to his horse, rode up to the porch, swung his leg over the
saddle with a supple youthful movement, stood for a moment in the
stirrup as if loathe to part from his horse, and at last sprang down and
called to his orderly . “Ah, Bond arénko, dear friend!” said he to the hussar who rushed
up headlong to the horse. “Walk him up and down, my dear fellow ,”
he continued, with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted
young people show to everyone when they are happy . “Yes, your excellency ,” answered the Ukrainian gaily , tossing his
head. “Mind, walk him up and down well!”
Another hussar also rushed toward the horse, but Bondarénko had
already thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse’ s head. It
was evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to
serve him. Rostóv patted the horse’ s neck and then his flank, and
lingered for a moment. “Splendid! What a horse he will be!” he thought with a smile, and
holding up his saber, his spurs jingling , he ran up the steps of the
porch. His landlord, who in a waistcoat  and a pointed cap, pitchfork
in hand, was clearing manure from the cowhouse, looked out, and his
face immediately brightened on seeing Rostóv . “Schön gut Morgen! Schön gut Morgen!”  * he said winking with a merry smile, evidently
pleased to greet the young man. * “A very good morning! A very good morning!”
“Schon fleissig?”  * said Rostóv with the same gay brothe rly smile
which did not leave his eager face. “Hoch Oestr eicher! Hoch
Russen! Kaiser Alexander hoch!”  *(2) said he, quoting words often
repeated by the German landlord. * “Busy already?”
* (2) “Hurrah for the Austrians! Hurrah for the Russians! Hurrah for Emperor Alexander!”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 137/174The German laughed, came out of the cowshed, pulled off his cap,
and waving it above his head cried:
“Und die ganze W elt hoch!”  *
* “And hurrah for the whole world!”
Rostóv waved his cap above his head like the German and cried
laughing, “Und vivat die ganze Welt!”  Though neither the German
cleaning his cowshed nor Rostóv back with his platoon from
foraging for hay had any reason for rejoicing, they looked at each
other with joyful delight and brotherly love, wagged their heads in
token of their mutual affection, and parted smiling, the German
returning to his cowshed and Rostóv going to the cottage he
occupied with Denísov . “What about your master?” he asked Lavrúshka, Denísov’ s
orderly , whom all the regiment knew for a rogue. “Hasn’ t been in since the evening.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Must have been losing,”
answered Lavrúshka . “I know by now, if he wins he comes back
early to brag about it, but if he stays out till morning it means he’s
lost and will come back in a rage. Will you have cof fee?”
“Yes, bring some.”
Ten minutes later Lavrúshka brought the coffee. “He’ s coming!”
said he. “Now for trouble!” Rostóv looked out of the window and
saw Denísov coming home. Denísov was a small man with a red
face, sparkling black eyes, and black tousled mustache and hair. He
wore an unfastened  cloak, wide breech es hanging down in creases,
and a crumpled shako on the back of his head.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"He came up to the
porch gloomily , hanging his head. “Lavwúska!” he shouted loudly and angrily , “take it off,
blockhead!”
“Well, I am taking it of f,” replied Lavrúshka’ s voice. “Ah, you’re up already ,” said Denísov , entering the room. “Long ago,” answered Rostóv , “I have  already been for the hay,
and have seen Fräulein Mathilde.”
“Weally! And I’ve been losing, bwother . I lost yesterday like a
damned fool!” cried Denísov , not pronou ncing his r’s. “Such ill luck!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Such ill luck. As soon as you left, it began and went on.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Hullo there! Tea!”
Puckering up his face though smiling , and showing his short
strong teeth, he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up
his thick tangled black hair . “And what devil made me go to that wat?” (an officer nicknamed
“the rat”) he said, rubbing his forehead and whole face with both
hands. “Just fancy , he didn’ t let me win a single cahd, not one cahd.”
He took the lighted pipe that was offered to him, gripped it in his
fist, and tapped it on the floor , making the sparks fly, while he
continued to shout. “He lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles
it; gives the singles and snatches the doubles!”
He scatter ed the burning tobacco, smas hed the pipe, and threw it
away . Then he remained silent for a while, and all at once looked6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 138/174cheerfully with his glittering, black eyes at Rostóv . “If at least we had some women here; but there’ s nothing foh one
to do but dwink.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"If we could only get to fighting soon. Hullo, who’ s
there?” he said, turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy boots
and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop, and a respectful cough. “The squadron quartermaster!” said Lavrúshka. Denísov’ s face puckered still more. “Wetched!” he muttered, throwing down a purse with some gold
in it. “Wostóv , deah fellow , just see how much there is left and shove
the purse  undah the pillow ,” he said, and went out to the
quartermaster . Rostóv took the money and, mechanically arranging the old and
new coins in separate piles, began counting them. “Ah!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Telyánin! How d’ye do? They plucked me last night,” came
Denísov’ s voice from the next room. “Where? At Bykov’ s, at the rat’s... I knew it,” replied a piping
voice, and Lieutenant Telyánin, a small officer of the same squadron,
entered the room. Rostóv thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little
hand which was offered him. Telyánin for some reason had been
transferred from the Guards just before  this campaign. He behaved
very well in the regiment but was not liked; Rostóv especially
detested him and was unable to overcome or conceal his groundless
antipathy to the man. “Well, young cavalryman, how is my Rook behaving?” he asked. (Rook was a young horse Telyánin had sold to Rostóv .)
The lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in
the face; his eyes continually wandered from one object to another . “I saw you riding this morning...” he added. “Oh, he’s all right, a good horse,” answered Rostóv , though the
horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth
half that sum. “He’ s begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg,” he
added. “The hoof ’s cracked! That’ s nothing. I’ll teach you what to do and
show you what kind of rivet to use.”
“Yes, please do,” said Rostóv . “I’ll show  you, I’ll show you! It’s not a secret. And it’s a horse
you’ll thank me for .”
“Then I’ll have it brought round,” said Rostóv wishing to avoid
Telyánin, and he went out to give the order . In the passage Denísov , with a pipe, was squatting on the
threshold facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him. On
seeing Rostóv , Denísov screwed up his face and pointing over his
shoulder with his thumb to the room where Telyánin was sitting, he
frowned and gave a shudder of disgust. “Ugh! I don’t like that fellow ,” he said, regardless of the
quartermaster ’s presence. Rostóv shrugged his shoulders as much  as to say: “Nor do I, but
what’ s one to do?”  and, having given his order , he returned to
Telyánin.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 139/174Telyánin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rostóv
had left him, rubbing his small white hands. “Well there certainly are disgusting people,” thought Rostóv as he
entered. “Have you told them to bring the horse ?” asked Telyánin, getting
up and looking carelessly about him. “I have.”
“Let us go ourselves. I only came round to ask Denísov about
yesterday’ s order . Have you got it, Denísov?”
“Not yet. But where are you of f to?”
“I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse,” said
Telyánin. They went through the porch and into the stable. The lieutenant
explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters. When Rostóv went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage
on the table. Deníso v was sitting there scratching with his pen on a
sheet of paper . He looked gloomily in Rostóv’ s face and said: “I am
witing to her .”
He leaned his elbow s on the table with his pen in his hand and,
evidently glad of a chance to say quicke r in words what he wanted to
write, told Rostóv the contents of his letter . “You see, my fwiend,” he said, “we sleep when we don’t love.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"We
are childw en of the dust... but one falls in love and one is a God, one
is pua’ as on the fihst day of cweation... Who’ s that now? Send him
to the devil, I’m busy!” he shouted to Lavrúshka, who went up to
him not in the least abashed. “Who should it be?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"You yourself told him to come. It’s the
quartermaster for the money .”
Denísov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped. “Wetched business,” he muttered to himself. “How much is left in
the puhse?” he asked, turning to Rostóv . “Seven new and three old imperials.”
“Oh, it’s wetched! Well, what are you standing there for, you
sca’cwow? Call the quahtehmasteh,” he shouted to Lavrúshka. “Please, Denísov , let me lend you some: I have some, you know ,”
said Rostóv , blushing. “Don’ t like bowwowing from my own fellows, I don’t,” growled
Denísov . “But if you won’ t accept money from me like a comrade, you will
offend me. Really I have some,” Rostóv repeated. “No, I tell you.”
And Denísov went to the bed to get the purse from under the
pillow . “Where have you put it, Wostóv?”
“Under the lower pillow .”
“It’s not there.”
Denísov threw both pillows on the floor . The purse was not there. “That’ s a miwacle.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 140/174“Wait, haven’ t you dropped it?” said Rostóv , picking up the
pillows one at a time and shaking them. He pulled of f the quilt and shook it. The purse was not there. “Dear me, can I have forgotten? No, I remember thinking that you
kept it under your head like a treasure,” said Rostóv . “I put it just
here. Where is it?” he asked, turning to Lavrúshka. “I haven’ t been in the room. It must be where you put it.”
“But it isn’ t?...”
“You’re always like that; you thwow a thing down anywhere and
forget it. Feel in your pockets.”
“No, if I hadn’ t thought of it being a treasure,” said Rostóv , “but I
remember putting it there.”
Lavrúshka turned all the bedding over, looked under the bed and
under the table, searched everywhere, and stood still in the middle of
the room. Denísov silently watched Lavrúshka’ s movements, and
when the latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere
to be found Denísov glanced at Rostóv . “Wostóv , you’ve not been playing schoolboy twicks...”
Rostóv felt Denísov’ s gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, and
instantly dropped them again. All the blood which had seemed
congested somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes. He could not draw breath. “And there hasn’ t been anyone in the room except the lieutenant
and yourselves. It must be here somewhere,” said Lavrúshka. “Now then, you devil’ s puppet, look alive and hunt for it!”
shouted Denísov , suddenly , turning purple and rushing at the man
with a threatening gesture. “If the purse  isn’t found I’ll flog you, I’ll
flog you all.”
Rostóv , his eyes avoiding Denísov , began buttoning his coat,
buckled on his saber , and put on his cap. “I must have that purse, I tell you,” shouted Denísov , shaking his
orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall. “Denísov , let him alone, I know who has taken it,” said Rostóv ,
going toward the door without raising his eyes. Denísov paused,
thought a moment, and, evidently understanding what Rostóv hinted
at, seized his arm. “Nonsense!” he cried, and the veins on his forehead and neck
stood out like cords . “You are mad, I tell you. I won’ t allow it. The
purse is here! I’ll flay this scoundwel alive, and it will be found.”
“I know who has taken it,” repeated Rostóv in an unsteady voice,
and went to the door . “And I tell you, don’t you dahe to do it!” shouted Denísov , rushing
at the cadet to restrain him. But Rostó v pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as
though Denísov were his worst enemy , firmly fixed his eyes directly
on his face. “Do you understand  what you’re saying ?” he said in a trembling
voice. “There was no one else in the room except myself. So that if it
is not so, then...”
He could not finish, and ran out of the room.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 141/174“Ah, may the devil take you and evewy body ,” were the last words
Rostóv heard. Rostóv went to Telyánin’ s quarters. “The mast er is not in, he’s gone to headquarters,” said Telyánin’ s
orderly . “Has something happened?” he added, surprised at the
cadet’ s troubled face. “No, nothing.”
“You’ve only just missed him,” said the orderly . The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck,
and Rostóv , without returning home, took a horse and rode there. There was an inn in the village which the officers frequented. Rostóv
rode up to it and saw Telyánin’ s horse at the porch. In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish
of sausages and a bottle of wine. “Ah, you’ve come here too, young man!” he said, smiling and
raising his eyebrows. “Yes,” said Rostóv as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word;
and he sat down at the nearest table. Both were silent. There were two Germans and a Russian officer
in the room. No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter
of knives and the munching of the lieutenant. When Telyánin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a
double purse and, drawing its rings aside with his small, white,
turned-up fingers, drew out a gold impe rial, and lifting his eyebrows
gave it to the waiter . “Please be quick,” he said. The coin was a new one. Rostóv rose and went up to Telyánin. “Allow me to look at your purse,” he said in a low, almost
inaudible, voice. With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, Telyánin handed him
the purse. “Yes, it’s a nice purse. Yes, yes,” he said, growing suddenly pale,
and added, “Look at it, young man.”
Rostóv took the purse in his hand, examined it and the money in
it, and looked at Telyánin. The lieutenant was looking about in his
usual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry . “If we get to Vienna I’ll get rid of it there but in these wretched
little towns there’ s nowhere to spend it,” said he. “Well, let me have
it, young man, I’m going.”
Rostóv did not speak. “And you?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Are you going to have lunch too? They feed you quite
decently here,” continued Telyánin. “Now then, let me have it.”
He stretch ed out his hand to take hold of the purse. Rostóv let go
of it. Telyánin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the
pocket of his riding breeches, with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth
slightly open, as if to say, “Yes, yes, I am putting my purse in my
pocket and that’ s quite simple and is no one else’ s business.”
“Well, young man?”  he said with a sigh, and from under his lifted
brows he glanced into Rostóv’ s eyes.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 142/174Some flash as of an electric spark shot from Telyánin’ s eyes to
Rostóv’ s and back, and back again and again in an instant. “Come here,” said Rostóv , catching hold of Telyánin’ s arm and
almost dragging him to the window . “That money is Denísov’ s; you
took it...” he whispered just above Telyánin’ s ear. “What?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
What?,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"How dare you? What?” said Telyánin. But these  words came like a piteous, despairing cry and an
entreaty for pardon. As soon as Rostó v heard them, an enormous
load of doubt fell from him. He was glad, and at the same instant
began to pity the miserable man who stood before him, but the task
he had begun had to be completed. “Heaven only knows what the people here may imagine,”
muttered Telyánin, taking up his cap and moving toward a small
empty room. “W e must have an explanation...”
“I know it and shall prove it,” said Rostóv . “I...”
Every muscle of Telyánin’ s pale, terrified face began to quiver , his
eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not
rising to Rostóv’ s face, and his sobs were audible. “Count!...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Don’ t ruin a young fellow ... here is this wretched
money , take it...” He threw it on the table. “I have an old father and
mother!...”
Rostóv took the money , avoiding Telyánin’ s eyes, and went out of
the room without a word. But at the door he stopped and then
retraced his steps. “O God,” he said with tears in his eyes, “how
could you do it?”
“Count...” said Telyánin drawing nearer to him. “Don’ t touch me,” said Rostóv , drawing  back. “If you need it, take
the money ,” and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

That same evening there was an animated discussion among the
squadron’ s officers in Denísov’ s quarters. “And I tell you, Rostóv, that you must apologize to the colonel!”
said a tall, grizzly-ha ired staff captain, with enormous mustaches and
many wrinkles on his large features, to Rostóv who was crimson
with excitement. The staff captain, Kírsten, had twice been reduced to the ranks for
affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission. “I will allow no one to call me a liar!” cried Rostóv . “He told me I
lied, and I told him he lied.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"And there it rests. He may keep me on
duty every day, or may place me under arrest, but no one can make
me apologize, because if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it
beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, then...”
“You just wait a moment, my dear fellow , and listen,” interrupted
the staff captain in his deep bass, calmly  stroking his long mustache. “You tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer
has stolen...”
“I’m not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of
other officers. Perha ps I ought not to have spoken before them, but I
am not a diplomatist. That’ s why I joined the hussars, thinking that
here one would not need finesse; and he tells me that I am lying—so
let him give me satisfaction...”
“That’ s all right. No one thinks you a coward, but that’s not the
point. Ask Denísov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to
demand satisfaction of his regimental commander?”
Denísov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the
conversation, eviden tly with no wish to take part in it. He answered
the staf f captain’ s question by a disapproving shake of his head. “You speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other
officers,” continued the staff captain, “and Bogdánich” (the colonel
was called Bogdánich) “shuts you up.”
“He did not shut me up, he said I was telling an untruth.”
“Well, have it so, and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must
apologize.”
“Not on any account!” exclaimed Rostóv . “I did not expect this of you,” said the staff captain seriously and
severely . “You don’t wish to apologize, but, man, it’s not only to him
but to the whole regiment—all of us—you’re to blame all round. The
case is this: you ought to have though t the matter over and taken
advice; but no, you go and blurt it all straight out before the officers. Now what  was the colonel to do? Have the officer tried and disgrace
the whole  regiment? Disgrace the whole regiment because of one
scoundrel? Is that how you look at it?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"We don’t see it like that. And
Bogdánich was a brick: he told you you were saying what was not6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 144/174true. It’s not pleasant, but what’ s to be done, my dear fellow?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"You
landed yourself in it. And now, when one wants to smooth the thing
over, some conceit prevents your apologizing, and you wish to make
the whole affair public. You are offende d at being put on duty a bit,
but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer? Whatever
Bogdánich may be, anyway he is an honorable and brave old
colonel! You’re quick at taking offense, but you don’t mind
disgracing the whole regiment!” The staff captain’ s voice began to
tremble. “You have been in the regiment next to no time, my lad,
you’re here today and tomorrow you’ll be appointed adjutant
somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said ‘There are
thieves among the Pávlograd officers!’  But it’s not all the same to us! Am I not right, Denísov? It’ s not the same!”
Denísov remained silent and did not move, but occasionally
looked with his glittering black eyes at Rostóv . “You value your own pride and don’t wish to apologize,”
continued the staff captain, “but we old fellows, who have grown up
in and, God willing, are going to die in the regiment, we prize the
honor of the regiment, and Bogdánich knows it. Oh, we do prize it,
old fellow!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"And all this is not right, it’s not right!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"You may take
offense or not but I always stick to mother truth. It’ s not right!”
And the staf f captain rose and turned away from Rostóv . “That’ s twue, devil take it!” shouted Denísov , jumping up. “Now
then, Wostóv , now then!”
Rostóv , growing red and pale alternately , looked first at one officer
and then at the other . “No, gentlemen, no...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
you mustn’ t think... I quite understand. You’re wrong to think that of me... I...,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"for me... for the honor of the
regiment I’d... Ah well, I’ll show that in action, and for me the honor
of the flag... Well, never mind, it’s true I’m to blame, to blame all
round. Well, what else do you want?...”
“Come, that’s right,  Count!” cried the staff captain, turning round
and clapping Rostóv on the shoulder with his big hand. “I tell you,” shouted Denísov , “he’ s a fine fellow .”
“That’ s better , Count,” said the staff captain, beginning to address
Rostóv by his title, as if in recognition of his confession. “Go and
apologize, your excellency . Yes, go!”
“Gentlemen, I’ll do anything. No one shall hear a word from me,”
said Rostóv in an imploring voice, “but I can’t apologize, by God I
can’t, do what you will! How can I go and apologize like a little boy
asking for giveness?”
Denísov began to laugh. “It’ll be worse for you. Bogdánich is vindictive and you’ll pay for
your obstinacy ,” said Kírsten. “No, on my word it’s not obstinacy! I can’t describe the feeling. I
can’t...”
“Well, it’s as you like,” said the staff captain. “And what has
become of that scoundrel?” he asked Denísov . “He has weported himself sick, he’s to be stwuck off the list

staff captain. “Illness or not, he’d better not cwoss my path. I’d kill him!”
shouted Denísov in a bloodthirsty tone. Just then Zherkóv entered the room. “What brings you here?” cried the officers turning to the
newcomer . “We’re to go into action, gentlemen! Mack has surrendered with
his whole army .”
“It’s not true!”
“I’ve seen him myself!”
“What? Saw the real Mack? With hands and feet?”
“Into action! Into action!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Bring him a bottle for such news! But
how did you come here?”
“I’ve been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil,
Mack. An Austrian general complained of me. I congratulated him
on Mack’ s arrival... What’ s the matter , Rostóv? You look as if you’d
just come out of a hot bath.”
“Oh, my dear fellow , we’re in such a stew here these last two
days.”
The regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought
by Zherkóv . They were under orders to advance next day .","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"

Kutúzov fell back toward Vienna, destroying behind him the
bridges over the rivers Inn (at Braunau ) and Traun (near Linz). On
October 23 the Russian troops were crossing the river Enns. At
midday the Russian baggage train, the artillery , and columns of
troops were defiling  through the town of Enns on both sides of the
bridge. It was a warm, rainy , autumnal day. The wide expanse that opened
out before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding
the bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting
rain, and then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects
could be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished. Down
below , the little town  could be seen with its white, red-roofed houses,
its cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling
masses of Russian troops. At the bend of the Danube, vessels, an
island, and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the
confluence of the Enns and the Danube became visible, and the
rocky left bank of the Danube covered with pine forests, with a
mystic background of green treetops and bluish gorges. The turrets
of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest, and far away
on the other side of the Enns the enemy’ s horse patrols could be
discerned. Among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in
command of the rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning the
country through his fieldglass. A little behind them Nesvítski, who
had been sent to the rearguard by the commander in chief, was sitting
on the trail of a gun carriage. A Cossac k who accompanied him had
handed him a knapsack and a flask, and Nesvítski was treating some
officers to pies and real doppelkümmel . The officers gladly gathered
round him, some on their knees, some squatting Turkish fashion on
the wet grass. “Yes, the Austrian prince who built that castle was no fool. It’s a
fine place! Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?” Nesvítski
was saying. “Thank you very much, Prince,” answered one of the officers,
pleased to be talking to a staff officer of such importance. “It’s a
lovely place! We passed close to the park and saw two deer... and
what a splendid house!”
“Look, Prince,” said another , who woul d have dearly liked to take
another pie but felt shy, and therefore pretended to be examining the
countryside—“See, our infantrymen have already got there. Look
there in the meadow  behind the village, three of them are dragging
something. They’ll ransack that castle,” he remarked with evident
approval. “So they will,” said Nesvítski. “No, but what I should like,” added
he, munch ing a pie in his moist-lipped handsome mouth, “would be
to slip in over there.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 147/174He pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery , and his eyes
narrowed and gleamed. “That would be fine, gentlemen!”
The of ficers laughed. “Just to flutter the nuns a bit. They say there are Italian girls
among them. On my word I’d give five years of my life for it!”
“They must be feeling dull, too,” said one of the bolder officers,
laughing. Meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out
something to the general, who looked through his field glass. “Yes, so it is, so it is,” said the general angrily , lowering the field
glass and shrugging his shoulders, “so it is! They’ll be fired on at the
crossing. And why are they dawdling there?”
On the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye,
and from their battery a milk-white cloud arose. Then came the
distant report of a shot, and our troops could be seen hurrying to the
crossing. Nesvítski rose, puf fing, and went up to the general, smiling. “Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?” he said. “It’s a bad business,” said the general without answering him, “our
men have been wasting time.”
“Hadn’ t I better ride over , your excellency?” asked Nesvítski. “Yes, please do,” answered the general,  and he repeated the order
that had already once been given in detail: “and tell the hussars that
they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered; and the
inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected.”
“Very good,” answered Nesvítski. He called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put away the
knapsack and flask, and swung his heavy person easily into the
saddle. “I’ll really call in on the nuns,” he said to the officers who
watched him smilingly , and he rode off by the winding path down
the hill. “Now then, let’s see how far it will carry, Captain. Just try!” said
the general, turning to an artillery officer. “Have a little fun to pass
the time.”
“Crew , to your guns!” commanded the of ficer. In a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and
began loading. “One!” came the command. Number one jumped briskly aside. The gun rang out with a
deafening metallic roar, and a whistli ng grenade flew above the
heads of our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy , a
little smoke showing the spot where it burst. The faces  of officers and men brightened up at the sound. Everyone got up and began watching the movements of our troops
below , as plainly visible as if but a stone’ s throw away , and the
movements of the approaching enemy farther off. At the same instant
the sun came fully out from behind the clouds, and the clear sound of6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

single joyous and spirited impression.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

Two of the enemy’ s shots had already  flown across the bridge,
where there was a crush. Halfway across stood Prince Nesvítski, who
had alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against
the railings. He looked back laughing to the Cossack who stood a
few steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles. Each time
Prince Nesvítski tried to move on, soldiers and carts pushed him
back again  and pressed him against the railings, and all he could do
was to smile. “What a fine fellow you are, friend!” said the Cossack to a convoy
soldier with a wago n, who was pressing onto the infantrymen who
were crow ded toget her close to his wheels and his horses. “What a
fellow!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"You can’t wait a moment! Don’ t you see the general wants to
pass?”
But the convoyman  took no notice of the word “general” and
shouted at the soldiers who were blocki ng his way. “Hi there, boys! Keep to the left! Wait a bit.” But the soldiers, crowded together
shoulder to shoulder , their bayonets interlocking, moved over the
bridge in a dense mass. Looking down over the rails Prince Nesvítski
saw the rapid, noisy little waves of the Enns, which rippling and
eddying round the piles of the bridg e chased each other along. Looking on the bridge he saw equally uniform living waves of
soldiers, shoulder straps, covered shako s, knapsacks, bayonets, long
muskets, and, under the shakos, faces with broad cheekbones,
sunken cheeks, and listless tired expre ssions, and feet that moved
through the sticky mud that covered  the planks of the bridge. Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men, like a fleck of
white foam on the waves of the Enns, an officer, in a cloak and with
a type of face different from that of the men, squeezed his way
along; sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river, an hussar
on foot, an orderly , or a townsman was carried through the waves of
infantry; and sometimes like a log floating down the river, an
officers’  or company’ s baggage wagon, piled high, leather covered,
and hemmed in on all sides, moved across the bridge. “It’s as if a dam had burst,” said the Cossack hopelessly . “Are
there many more of you to come?”
“A million all but one!” replied a wagg ish soldier in a torn coat,
with a wink, and passed on followed by another , an old man. “If he” (he meant the enemy) “begins popping at the bridge now,”
said the old soldier dismally to a comra de, “you’ll forget to scratch
yourself.”
That soldier passed on, and after him came another sitting on a
cart. “Where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to?” said an
orderly , running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 150/174And he also passed on with the wagon. Then came some merry
soldiers who had evidently been drinking. “And then, old fellow, he gives him one in the teeth with the butt
end of his gun...” a soldier whose great coat was well tucked up said
gaily , with a wide swing of his arm. “Yes, the ham was just delicious...” answered another with a loud
laugh. And they, too, passed on, so that Nesvítski did not learn who
had been struck on the teeth, or what the ham had to do with it. “Bah!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"How  they scurry . He just sends a ball and they think they’ll
all be killed,” a ser geant was saying angrily and reproachfully . “As it flies past me, Daddy , the ball I mean,” said a young soldier
with an enormous mouth, hardly refraining from laughing, “I felt like
dying of fright. I did, ‘pon my word, I got that frightened!” said he,
as if bragging of having been frightened. That one also passed.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Then followed a cart unlike any that had
gone before. It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a
German, and seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects. A fine
brindled cow with a large udder was attached to the cart behind. A
woman with an unweaned baby , an old woman, and a healthy
German girl with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather
beds. Evidently these fugitives were allowed to pass by special
permission. The eyes of all the soldier s turned toward the women,
and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace all the soldiers’
remarks related to the two young ones. Every face bore almost the
same smile, expressing unseemly thoughts about the women. “Just see, the German sausage is making tracks, too!”
“Sell me the missis,” said another soldier , addressing the German,
who, angry and frightened, strode energetically along with downcast
eyes. “See how smart she’ s made herself! Oh, the devils!”
“There, Fedótov , you should be quartered on them!”
“I have seen as much before now , mate!”
“Where are you going?” asked an infantry officer who was eating
an apple, also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl. The German closed his eyes, signifying that he did not understand. “Take it if you like,” said the of ficer, giving the girl an apple. The girl smiled and took it. Nesvítski like the rest of the men on
the bridge  did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed. When they had gone by, the same stream of soldiers followed, with
the same kind of talk, and at last all stopped. As often happens, the
horses of a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge,
and the whole crowd had to wait. “And why are they stopping? There’ s no proper order!” said the
soldiers. “Where are you shoving to? Devil take you! Can’ t you
wait? It’ll be worse if he fires the bridge. See, here’ s an officer
jammed in too”—dif ferent voices were saying in the crowd, as the
men looke d at one another , and all pressed toward the exit from the
bridge. Looking down at the waters of the Enns under the bridge,
Nesvítski suddenly heard a sound new to him, of something swiftly6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 151/174approaching... something big, that splashed into the water . “Just see where it carries to!” a soldier near by said sternly ,
looking round at the sound. “Encouraging us to get along quicker ,” said another uneasily . The crowd moved on again. Nesvítsk i realized that it was a
cannon ball. “Hey , Cossack, my horse!” he said. “Now , then, you there! get out
of the way! Make way!”
With great difficulty he managed to get to his horse, and shouting
continually he moved on. The soldiers squeezed themselves to make
way for him, but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg,
and those nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves
pressed still harder from behind. “Nesvítski, Nesvítski! you numskull!” came a hoarse voice from
behind him. Nesvítski looked round and saw, some fifteen paces away but
separated by the living mass of moving infantry , Váska Denísov , red
and shaggy , with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak
hanging jauntily over his shoulder . “Tell these  devils, these fiends, to let me pass!” shouted Denísov
evidently in a fit of rage, his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot
whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a
small bare hand as red as his face. “Ah, Váska!” joyfully replied Nesvítski. “What’ s up with you?”
“The squadwon can’t pass,” shouted Váska Denísov , showing his
white teeth  fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab, which
twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it, and snorted, spurting
white foam from his bit, tramping the planks of the bridge with his
hoofs, and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let
him. “What is this? They’re like sheep! Just like sheep! Out of the
way!... Let us pass!...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Stop there, you devil with the cart! I’ll hack
you with my saber!” he shouted, actual ly drawing his saber from its
scabbard and flourishing it. The soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces, and
Denísov joined Nesvítski. “How’ s it you’re not drunk today?” said Nesvítski when the other
had ridden up to him. “They don’t even give one time to dwink!” answered Váska
Denísov . “They keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day. If
they mean to fight, let’ s fight. But the devil knows what this is.”
“What a dandy you are today!” said Nesvítski, looking at
Denísov’ s new cloak and saddlecloth. Denísov smiled, took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that
diffused a smell of perfume, and put it to Nesvítski’ s nose. “Of course . I’m going into action! I’ve shaved, bwushed my teeth,
and scented myself.”
The imposing figure of Nesvítski follow ed by his Cossack, and the
determination of Denísov who flourished his sword and shouted
frantically , had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through
to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry . Beside the6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 152/174bridge Nesvítski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the
order , and having done this he rode back. Having cleared the way Denísov stopped at the end of the bridge. Carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the
ground, eager to rejoin its fellows, he watched his squadron draw
nearer . Then the clang of hoofs, as of several horses galloping,
resounded on the planks of the bridge, and the squadron, officers in
front and men four abreast, spread across the bridge and began to
emer ge on his side of it. The infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the
trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill-will,
estrangement, and ridicule with which troops of different arms
usually encounter one another at the clean, smart hussars who moved
past them in regular order . “Smart lads!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
Only fit for a fair!” said one. “What good are they?,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"They’re led about just for show!” remarked
another . “Don’ t kick up the dust, you infantry!” jested an hussar whose
prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers. “I’d like to put you on a two days’  march with a knapsack! Your
fine cords would soon get a bit rubbed,”  said an infantryman, wiping
the mud off his face with his sleeve. “Perched up there, you’re more
like a bird than a man.”
“There now, Zíkin, they ought to put you on a horse. You’d look
fine,” said a corporal, chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the
weight of his knapsack. “Take a stick between your legs, that’ll  suit you for a horse!” the
hussar shouted back.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge, squeezing
together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel. At last
the baggage wagons had all crossed, the crush was less, and the last
battalion came onto the bridge. Only Denísov’ s squadron of hussars
remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy , who
could be seen from  the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet
visible from the bridge, for the horizon as seen from the valley
through which the river flowed was formed by the rising ground only
half a mile away . At the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a
few groups of our Cossack scouts were moving. Suddenly on the
road at the top of the high ground, artillery and troops in blue
uniform were seen. These were the French. A group of Cossack
scouts retired down the hill at a trot. All the officers and men of
Denísov’ s squadron , though they tried to talk of other things and to
look in other directions, thought only of what was there on the
hilltop, and kept constantly looking at the patches appearing on the
skyline, which they knew to be the enemy’ s troops. The weather had
cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly upon
the Danube and the dark hills around it. It was calm, and at intervals
the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard from the
hill. There was no one now between the squadron and the enemy
except a few scatter ed skirmishers. An empty space of some seven
hundred yards was all that separated them. The enemy ceased firing,
and that stern, threatening, inaccessible, and intangible line which
separates two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt. “One step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line
dividing the living from the dead lies uncertainty , suffering, and
death. And what is there? Who is there?—there beyond that field,
that tree, that roof lit up by the sun? No one knows, but one wants to
know .","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"You fear and yet long to cross that line, and know that sooner
or later it must be crossed and you will have to find out what is there,
just as you will inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of
death. But you are strong, healthy , cheerful, and excited, and are
surrounded by other such excitedly animated and healthy men.” So
thinks, or at any rate feels, anyone who comes in sight of the enemy ,
and that feeling gives a particular glamour and glad keenness of
impression to everything that takes place at such moments. On the high ground where the enemy was, the smoke of a cannon
rose, and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron. The officers who had been standing together rode off to their places. The hussa rs began carefully aligning their horses. Silence fell on the
whole squadron. All were looking at the enemy in front and at the
squadron commander , awaiting the word of command. A second and
a third cannon ball flew past. Evidently they were firing at the
hussars, but the balls with rapid rhythmi c whistle flew over the heads
of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them. The hussars did
not look round, but at the sound of each shot, as at the word of6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 154/174command, the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so
different, holding its breath while the ball flew past, rose in the
stirrups and sank back again. The soldiers without turning their heads
glanced at one another , curious to see their comrades’  impression. Every face, from Denísov’ s to that of the bugler , showed one
common expression of conflict, irritation, and excitement, around
chin and mouth. The quartermaster frowned, looking at the soldiers
as if threat ening to punish them. Cadet Mirónov ducked every time a
ball flew past. Rostóv on the left flank, mounted on his Rook—a
handsome horse despite its game leg—had the happy air of a
schoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in
which he feels sure he will distinguish himself. He was glancing at
everyone with a clear, bright expression, as if asking them to notice
how calmly he sat under fire.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"But despite himself, on his face too
that same indication  of something new and stern showed round the
mouth. “Who’ s that curtseying there? Cadet Miwónov! That’ s not wight! Look at me,” cried Denísov who, unab le to keep still on one spot,
kept turning his horse in front of the squadron. The black, hairy , snub-nosed face of Váska Denísov , and his
whole short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy
fingers in which he held the hilt of his naked saber , looked just as it
usually did, especially toward evening when he had emptied his
second bottle; he was only redder than usual. With his shaggy head
thrown back like birds when they drink, pressing his spurs
mercilessly into the sides of his good horse, Bedouin, and sitting as
though falling backwards in the saddle, he galloped to the other flank
of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse  voice to the men to look to
their pisto ls. He rode up to Kírsten. The staff captain on his broad-
backed, steady mare came at a walk to meet him. His face with its
long mustache was serious as always, only his eyes were brighter
than usual. “Well, what about it?” said he to Denísov . “It won’ t come to a
fight. You’ll see—we shall retire.”
“The devil only knows what they’re about!” muttered Denísov . “Ah, Wostóv ,” he cried noticing the cadet’ s bright face, “you’ve got
it at last.”
And he smiled approvingly , evidently pleased with the cadet. Rostóv felt perfectly happy . Just then the commander appeared on
the bridge. Denísov galloped up to him. “Your excellency! Let us attack them! I’ll dwive them of f.”
“Attack indeed!” said the colonel in a bored voice, puckering up
his face as if driving off a troublesome fly. “And why are you
stopping here? Don’ t you see the skirmishers are retreating? Lead the
squadron back.”
The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire
without having lost a single man. The second squadron that had been
in the front line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted
the farther side of the river . The two Pávlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired
up the hill one after the other . Their colonel, Karl Bogdánich
Schubert, came up to Denísov’ s squadron and rode at a footpace not6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 155/174far from Rostóv , without taking any notice of him although they
were now meeting for the first time since their encounter concerning
Telyánin. Rostóv , feeling that he was at the front and in the power of
a man toward whom  he now admitted that he had been to blame, did
not lift his eyes from the colonel’ s athletic back, his nape covered
with light hair, and his red neck. It seemed to Rostóv that Bogdánich
was only pretending not to notice him, and that his whole aim now
was to test the cadet’s courage, so he drew himself up and looked
around him merrily; then it seemed to him that Bogdánich rode so
near in order to show him his courag e. Next he thought that his
enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack just to punish
him—Rostóv . Then he imagined how, after the attack, Bogdánich
would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously
extend the hand of reconciliation. The high-shouldered figure of Zherkóv , familiar to the Pávlograds
as he had but recen tly left their regim ent, rode up to the colonel. After his dismissal from headquarters Zherkóv had not remained in
the regiment, saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front
when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff, and
had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince
Bagratión. He now came to his former chief with an order from the
commander of the rear guard. “Colonel,” he said, addressing Rostóv’ s enemy with an air of
gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades, “there is an
order to stop and fire the bridge.”
“An order to who?” asked the colonel morosely . “I don’t myself know ‘to who,’” replied the cornet in a serious
tone, “but the princ e told me to ‘go and tell the colonel that the
hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge.’”
Zherkóv was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the
colonel of hussars with the same order . After him the stout Nesvítski
came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his
weight. “How’ s this, Colonel?” he shouted as he approached. “I told you
to fire the bridge, and now someone has gone and blundered; they
are all beside them selves over there and one can’t make anything
out.”
The colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to
Nesvítski. “You spoke to me of inflammable material,” said he, “but you said
nothing about firing it.”
“But, my dear sir,” said Nesvítski as he drew up, taking off his cap
and smoot hing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand,
“wasn’ t I telling you to fire the bridge, when inflammable material
had been put in position?”
“I am not your ‘dear  sir,’ Mr. Staff Officer, and you did not tell me
to burn the bridge! I know the service , and it is my habit orders
strictly to obey . You said the bridge would be burned, but who would
burn it, I could not know by the holy spirit!”
“Ah, that’s always the way!” said Nesvítski with a wave of the
hand. “How did you get here?” said he, turning to Zherkóv .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 156/174“On the same business. But you are damp!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Let me wring you
out!”
“You were saying, Mr. Staff Officer...” continued the colonel in an
offended tone. “Colonel,” interrupted the officer of the suite, “You must be quick
or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot.”
The colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the stout
staff officer, and at Zherkóv , and he frowned. “I will the bridge fire,” he said in a solemn tone as if to announce
that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still
do the right thing. Striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to
blame for everythin g, the colonel moved forward and ordered the
second squadron, that in which Rostóv  was serving under Denísov ,
to return to the bridge. “There, it’s just as I thought,” said Rostóv to himself. “He wishes
to test me!” His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face. “Let him see whether I am a coward!” he thought. Again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious
expression appeared  that they had worn when under fire. Rostóv
watched his enemy , the colonel, closely—to find in his face
confirmation of his own conjecture, but the colonel did not once
glance at Rostóv , and looked as he always did when at the front,
solemn and stern. Then came the word of command. “Look sharp! Look sharp!” several voices repeated around him. Their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, the
hussars hastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to do. The
men were  crossing themselves. Rostóv no longer looked at the
colonel, he had no time. He was afraid of falling behind the hussars,
so much afraid that his heart stood still. His hand trembled as he
gave his horse into an orderly’ s charge, and he felt the blood rush to
his heart with a thud. Denísov rode past him, leaning back and
shouting something. Rostóv saw nothing but the hussars running all
around him, their spurs catching and their sabers clattering. “Stretchers!” shouted someone behind him. Rostóv did not think what this call for stretchers meant; he ran on,
trying only to be ahead of the others;  but just at the bridge, not
looking at the ground, he came on some sticky , trodden mud,
stumbled, and fell on his hands. The others outstripped him. “At boss zides, Captain,” he heard the voice of the colonel, who,
having ridden ahead, had pulled up his horse near the bridge, with a
triumphant, cheerful face. Rostóv wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his
enemy and was about to run on, thinking that the farther he went to
the front the better . But Bogdánich, without looking at or recognizing
Rostóv , shouted to him:
“Who’ s that running on the middle of the bridge? To the right! Come back, Cadet!” he cried angrily; and turning to Denísov , who,
showing of f his courage, had ridden on to the planks of the bridge:
“Why run risks, Captain? You should dismount,” he said.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 157/174“Oh, every bullet has its billet,” answered Váska Denísov , turning
in his saddle. Meanwhile Nesvítsk i, Zherkóv , and the officer of the suite were
standing together out of range of the shots, watching, now the small
group of men with yellow shakos, dark-green jackets braided with
cord, and blue ridin g breeches, who were swarming near the bridge,
and then at what was approaching in the distance from the opposite
side—the blue uniforms and groups with horses, easily recognizable
as artillery . “Will they burn the bridge or not? Who’ll get there first? Will they
get there and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot
range and wipe them out?” These were the questions each man of the
troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked
himself with a sinking heart—watching the bridge and the hussars in
the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other
side with their bayonets and guns. “Ugh. The hussars will get it hot!” said Nesvítski; “they are within
grapeshot range now .”
“He shoul dn’t have taken so many men,” said the officer of the
suite. “True enough,” answered Nesvítski; “two smart fellows could
have done the job just as well.”
“Ah, your excellency ,” put in Zherkó v, his eyes fixed on the
hussars, but still with that naïve air that made it impossible to know
whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest. “Ah, your excellency!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
How you look at things!,"War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Send two men? And who then would give
us the Vladímir medal and ribbon? But now, even if they do get
peppered, the squadron may be recomm ended for honors and he may
get a ribbon. Our Bogdánich knows how things are done.”
“There now!” said the of ficer of the suite, “that’ s grapeshot.”
He pointed to the French guns, the limbers of which were being
detached and hurriedly removed. On the French side, amid the groups with cannon, a cloud of
smoke appeared, then a second and a third almost simultaneously ,
and at the moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen. Then two reports one after another , and a third.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“Oh! Oh!” groaned Nesvítski as if in fierce pain, seizing the
officer of the suite by the arm. “Look! A man has fallen! Fallen,
fallen!”
“Two, I think.”
“If I were  Tsar I would never go to war,” said Nesvítski, turning
away . The French guns were hastily reloaded. The infantry in their blue
uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run. Smoke appeared again
but at irregular intervals, and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the
bridge. But this time Nesvítski could not see what was happening
there, as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it. The hussars had
succeeded in setting it on fire and the French batteries were now
firing at them, no longer to hinder them but because the guns were
trained and there was someone to fire at.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 158/174The Frenc h had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the
hussars got back to their horses. Two were misdirected and the shot
went too high, but the last round fell in the midst of a group of
hussars and knocked three of them over . Rostóv , absorbed by his relations with Bogdánich, had paused on
the bridge not know ing what to do. There was no one to hew down
(as he had always imagined battles to himself), nor could he help to
fire the bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with
him like the other soldiers. He stood  looking about him, when
suddenly he heard a rattle on the bridg e as if nuts were being spilt,
and the hussar nearest to him fell against the rails with a groan. Rostóv ran up to him with the others. Again someone shouted,
“Stretchers!” Four men seized the hussar and began lifting him. “Oooh! For Christ’ s sake let me alone! ” cried the wounded man,
but still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher . Nicholas Rostóv turned away and, as if searching for something,
gazed into the distan ce, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky, and at
the sun. How beautiful the sky looked; how blue, how calm, and how
deep! How bright and glorious was the setting sun! With what soft
glitter the waters of the distant Danube shone. And fairer still were
the faraway blue mountains beyond the river, the nunnery , the
mysterious gorges, and the pine forest s veiled in the mist of their
summits... There was peace and happiness... “I should wish for
nothing else, nothing, if only I were there,” thought Rostóv . “In
myself alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness; but
here... groans, suffering, fear, and this uncertainty and hurry ... There
—they are shouting again, and again are all running back
somewhere, and I shall run with them, and it, death, is here above me
and around... Another instant and I shall never again see the sun, this
water , that gor ge!...”
At that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds, and other
stretchers came into view before Rostóv . And the fear of death and of
the stretch ers, and love of the sun and of life, all merged into one
feeling of sickening agitation. “O Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, forgive, and
protect me!” Rostóv whispered. The hussars ran back to the men who held their horses; their
voices sounded louder and calmer , the stretchers disappeared from
sight. “Well, fwiend? So you’ve smelt powdah!” shouted Váska Denísov
just above his ear . “It’s all over; but I am a coward—yes, a coward!” thought Rostóv ,
and sighin g deeply he took Rook, his horse, which stood resting one
foot, from the orderly and began to mount. “Was that grapeshot?” he asked Denísov . “Yes and no mistake!” cried Denísov . “You worked like wegular
bwicks and it’s nasty work! An attack’ s pleasant work!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Hacking
away at the dogs! But this sort of thing is the very devil, with them
shooting at you like a tar get.”
And Denísov rode up to a group that had stopped near Rostóv ,
composed of the colonel, Nesvítski, Zherkóv , and the officer from
the suite.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 159/174“Well, it seems that no one has noticed, ” thought Rostóv . And this
was true. No one had taken any notice, for everyone knew the
sensation which the cadet under fire for the first time had
experienced. “Here’ s something for you to report,” said Zherkóv .","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“See if I don’t
get promoted to a sublieutenancy .”
“Inform the prince that I the bridge fired!” said the colonel
triumphantly and gaily . “And if he asks about the losses?”
“A trifle,”  said the colonel in his bass voice: “two hussars
wounded, and one knocked out,” he added, unable to restrain a
happy smile, and pronouncing the phrase “knocked out” with ringing
distinctness.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

Pursued by the French army of a hundred thousand men under the
command of Bonaparte, encounterin g a population that was
unfriendly to it, losing confidence in its allies, suffering from
shortness of supplies, and compelled to act under conditions of war
unlike anything that had been foreseen,  the Russian army of thirty-
five thousand men commanded by Kutúzov was hurriedly retreating
along the Danube, stopping where overtaken by the enemy and
fighting rearguard actions only as far as necessary to enable it to
retreat without losing its heavy equipme nt. There had been actions at
Lambach, Amstetten, and Melk; but despite the courage and
endurance—acknowledged even by the enemy—with which the
Russians fought, the only consequence of these actions was a yet
more rapid retreat. Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm
and had joined Kutú zov at Braunau now separated from the Russian
army , and Kutúzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted
forces. The defense of Vienna was no longer to be thought of. Instead
of an offensive, the plan of which, caref ully prepared in accord with
the moder n science of strategics, had been handed to Kutúzov when
he was in Vienna by the Austrian Hofkr iegsrath, the sole and almost
unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the
forces that were advancing from Russia, without losing his army as
Mack had done at Ulm. On the twenty-eight h of October Kutúzo v with his army crossed to
the left bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time
with the river between himself and the main body of the French. On
the thirtieth he attacked Mortier ’s division, which was on the left
bank, and broke it up. In this action for the first time trophies were
taken: banners, cannon, and two enemy generals. For the first time,
after a fortnight’ s retreat, the Russian troops had halted and after a
fight had not only held the field but had repulsed the French. Though
the troops were ill-clad, exhausted, and had lost a third of their
number in killed, wounded, sick, and stragglers; though a number of
sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the
Danube with a letter in which Kutúzov entrusted them to the
humanity of the enemy; and though the big hospitals and the houses
in Krems converted into military hospitals could no longer
accommodate all the sick and wounded,  yet the stand made at Krems
and the victory over Mortier raised the spirits of the army
considerably . Throughout the whole army and at headquarters most
joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach
of columns from Russia, of some victory gained by the Austrians,
and of the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte. Prince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the
Austrian General Schmidt, who was killed in the action. His horse
had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a
bullet. As a mark of the commander in chief ’s special favor he was
sent with the news of this victory to the Austrian court, now no6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 161/174longer at Vienna (which was threatened by the French) but at Brünn. Despite his apparently delicate build Prince Andrew could endure
physical fatigue far better than many very muscular men, and on the
night of the battle, having arrived at Krems excited but not weary ,
with dispatches from Dokhtúrov to Kutúzov , he was sent
immediately with a special dispatch to Brünn. To be so sent meant
not only a reward but an important step toward promotion. The night was dark but starry , the road showed black in the snow
that had fallen the previous day—the day of the battle. Reviewing his
impressions of the recent battle, picturi ng pleasantly to himself the
impression his news of a victory would create, or recalling the send-
off given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers,
Prince Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the
feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a long-desired
happiness. As soon as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with
the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of victory . Then he began to
imagine that the Russians were runnin g away and that he himself
was killed, but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy, as if
learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the
French had run away . He again recalled  all the details of the victory
and his own calm courage during the battle, and feeling reassured he
dozed off.... The dark starry night was followed by a bright cheerful
morning. The snow was thawing in the sunshine, the horses galloped
quickly , and on both sides of the road were forests of different kinds,
fields, and villages. At one of the post stations he overto ok a convoy of Russian
wounded. The Russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back
in the front cart, shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse. In each of the long German carts six or more pale, dirty, bandaged
men were  being jolted over the stony road. Some of them were
talking (he heard Russian words), others were eating bread; the more
severely wounded looked silently , with the languid interest of sick
children, at the envoy hurrying past them. Prince Andrew told his driver to stop, and asked a soldier in what
action they had been wounded. “Day before yesterday , on the
Danube,” answered the soldier . Prince Andrew took out his purse and
gave the soldier three gold pieces. “That’ s for them all,” he said to the of ficer who came up. “Get well soon, lads!” he continued, turning to the soldiers. “There’ s plenty to do still.”
“What news, sir?” asked the officer, evidently anxious to start a
conversation. “Good news!... Go on!” he shouted to the driver , and they
galloped on. It was already quite dark when Prince  Andrew rattled over the
paved streets of Brünn and found himself surrounded by high
buildings, the lights of shops, hous es, and street lamps, fine
carriages, and all that atmosphere of a large and active town which is
always so attractive to a soldier after camp life. Despite his rapid
journey and sleepless night, Prince Andrew when he drove up to the
palace felt even more vigorous and alert than he had done the day
before. Only his eyes gleamed feverish ly and his thoughts followed6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 162/174one another with extraordinary clearness and rapidity . He again
vividly recalled the details of the battle , no longer dim, but definite
and in the concise form in which he imagined himself stating them to
the Emper or Francis. He vividly imagined the casual questions that
might be put to him and the answers he would give. He expected to
be at once presented to the Emperor . At the chief entrance to the
palace, however , an official came running out to meet him, and
learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance. “To the right from the corridor , Euer Hoch gebor en! There you will
find the adjutant on duty,” said the official. “He will conduct you to
the Minister of War.”
The adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrew , asked him to wait,
and went in to the Minister of War. Five minutes later he returned
and bowing with particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew before
him along a corridor  to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at
work. The adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to
ward off any attem pt at familiarity on the part of the Russian
messenger . Prince Andrew’ s joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he
approached the door of the minister ’s room. He felt offended, and
without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into
one of disdain which was quite uncalled for. His fertile mind
instantly suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to
despise the adjutant and the minister . “Away from the smell of
powder , they probably think it easy to gain victories!” he thought. His eyes narrowed disdainfully , he entered the room of the Minister
of War with peculia rly deliberate steps. This feeling of disdain was
heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading
some papers and making pencil notes on them, and for the first two
or three minutes taking no notice of his arrival. A wax candle stood
at each side of the minister ’s bent bald head with its gray temples. He went on reading to the end, without raising his eyes at the
opening of the door and the sound of footsteps. “Take this and deliver it,” said he to his adjutant, handing him the
papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger . Prince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kutúzov’ s army
interested the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he
was conc erned with, or he wanted to give the Russian special
messenger that impression. “But that is a matter of perfect
indifference to me,” he thought. The minister drew the remaining
papers together , arranged them evenly , and then raised his head. He
had an intellectual and distinctive head, but the instant he turned to
Prince Andrew the firm, intelligent expression on his face changed in
a way evidently deliberate and habitual to him. His face took on the
stupid artificial smile (which does not even attempt to hide its
artificiality) of a man who is continually receiving many petitioners
one after another . “From General Field Marshal Kutúzov?” he asked. “I hope it is
good news? There has been an encounter with Mortier? A victory? It
was high time!”
He took the dispatc h which was addressed to him and began to
read it with a mournful expression.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 163/174“Oh, my God! My God! Schmidt!” he exclaimed in German. “What a calamity! What a calamity!”
Having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and
looked at Prince Andrew , evidently considering something. “Ah what a calamity ! You say the affair was decisive? But Mortier
is not captured.” Again he pondered. “I am very glad you have
brought good news, though Schmidt’ s death is a heavy price to pay
for the victory. His Majesty will no doubt wish to see you, but not
today . I thank you! You must have a rest. Be at the levee tomorrow
after the parade. However , I will let you know .”
The stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking,
reappeared. “Au revoir! Thank you very much. His Majesty will probably
desire to see you,” he added, bowing his head. When Prince Andrew  left the palace he felt that all the interest and
happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the
indifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant. The
whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed; the battle
seemed the memory of a remote event long past.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

Prince Andrew stayed at Brünn with Bilíbin, a Russian
acquaintance of his in the diplomatic service. “Ah, my dear princ e! I could not have a more welcome visitor ,”
said Bilíbin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew . “Franz, put the
prince’ s things in my bedroom,” said he to the servant who was
ushering Bolkónski  in. “So you’re a messenger of victory , eh? Splendid! And I am sitting here ill, as you see.”
After washing and dressing, Prince Andrew came into the
diplomat’ s luxurious  study and sat down to the dinner prepared for
him. Bilíbin settled down comfortably beside the fire. After his journey and the campaign during which he had been
deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of
life, Prince Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious
surroundings such as he had been accustomed to from childhood. Besides it was pleasant, after his reception by the Austrians, to speak
if not in Russian (for they were speak ing French) at least with a
Russian who would, he supposed, share the general Russian
antipathy to the Austrians which was then particularly strong. Bilíbin was a man of thirty-five, a bache lor, and of the same circle
as Prince Andrew . They had known each other previously in
Petersbur g, but had become more intima te when Prince Andrew was
in Vienna with Kutúzov . Just as Prince  Andrew was a young man
who gave promise of rising high in the military profession, so to an
even greater extent Bilíbin gave promise of rising in his diplomatic
career . He was still a young man but no longer a young diplomat, as
he had entered the service at the age of sixteen, had been in Paris and
Copenhagen, and now held a rather important post in Vienna. Both
the foreign minister and our ambassad or in Vienna knew him and
valued him. He was not one of those many diplomats who are
esteemed because they have certain negative qualities, avoid doing
certain things, and speak French. He was one of those, who, liking
work, knew how to do it, and despite his indolence would sometimes
spend a whole night at his writing table.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"He worked well whatever
the import  of his work. It was not the question “What for?” but the
question “How?” that interested him. What the diplomatic matter
might be he did not care, but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a
circular , memorandum, or report, skillfully , pointedly , and elegantly . Bilíbin’ s services were valued not only for what he wrote, but also
for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the highest
spheres. Bilíbin liked conver sation as he liked work, only when it could be
made elegantly witty . In society he always awaited an opportunity to
say somet hing striking and took part in a conversation only when
that was possible.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily
original, finished phrases of general interest. These sayings were
prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 165/174intentionally , so that insignificant society people might carry them
from draw ing room to drawing room. And, in fact, Bilíbin’ s
witticisms were hawked about in the Viennese drawing rooms and
often had an influence on matters considered important. His thin, worn, sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles,
which always looke d as clean and well washed as the tips of one’s
fingers after a Russi an bath. The movement of these wrinkles formed
the principal play of expression on his face. Now his forehead would
pucker into deep folds and his eyebrows were lifted, then his
eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks. His small, deep-set eyes always twinkled and looked out straight.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“Well, now tell me about your exploits,” said he. Bolkónski, very modestly without once mentioning himself,
described the engagement and his reception by the Minister of War. “They received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game
of skittles,” said he in conclusion. Bilíbin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared. “Cependant, mon cher,” he remarked, exam ining his nails from a
distance and puckering the skin above his left eye, “malgré la haute
estime que je professe pour  the Ortho dox Russi an army , j’avoue que
votre victoir e n’est pas des plus victorieuses.”  *
* “But my dear fellow, with all my respect for the Orthodox
Russian army, I must say that your victory was not
particularly victorious.”
He went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those
words in Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous
emphasis. “Come now!","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate
Mortier and his one division, and even then Mortier slips through
your fingers! Where’ s the victory?”
“But serio usly,” said Prince Andrew , “we can at any rate say
without boasting that it was a little better than at Ulm...”
“Why didn’ t you capture one, just one, marshal for us?”
“Because not everything happens as one expects or with the
smoothness of a parade. We had expected, as I told you, to get at
their rear by seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in
the afternoon.”
“And why didn’ t you do it at seven in the morning? You ought to
have been there at seven in the morni ng,” returned Bilíbin with a
smile. “Y ou ought to have been there at seven in the morning.”
“Why did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by
diplomatic methods  that he had better leave Genoa alone?” retorted
Prince Andrew in the same tone. “I know ,” interrupted Bilíbin, “you’re thinking it’s very easy to
take marshals, sitting on a sofa by the fire! That is true, but still why
didn’ t you capture him? So don’t be surprised if not only the
Minister of War but also his Most August Majesty the Emperor and
King Francis is not much delighted by your victory . Even I, a poor
secretary of the Russian Embassy , do not feel any need in token of6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

the Prater ... True, we have no Prater here...”
He looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his
forehead. “It is now my turn to ask you ‘why?’  mon cher,” said Bolkónski.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"“I confess I do not understand: perhaps there are diplomatic
subtleties here beyond my feeble intellig ence, but I can’t make it out. Mack loses a whole army , the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke
Karl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder . Kutúzov
alone at last gains  a real victory , destroying the spell of the
invincibility of the French, and the Minister of War does not even
care to hear the details.”
“That’ s just it, my dear fellow . You see it’s hurrah  for the Tsar, for
Russia, for the Orthodox Greek faith! All that is beautiful, but what
do we, I mean the Austrian court, care for your victories? Bring us
nice news of a victory by the Archdu ke Karl or Ferdinand (one
archduke’ s as good as another , as you know) and even if it is only
over a fire brigade of Bonaparte’ s, that will be another story and
we’ll fire off some cannon! But this sort of thing seems done on
purpose to vex us. The Archduke Karl does nothing, the Archduke
Ferdinand disgraces himself. You abandon Vienna, give up its
defense—as much as to say: ‘Heaven is with us, but heaven help you
and your capital!’  The one general whom we all loved, Schmidt, you
expose to a bullet, and then you congratulate us on the victory! Admit that more irritating news than yours could not have been
conceived. It’s as if it had been done on purpose, on purpose. Besides, suppose you did gain a brilliant victory , if even the
Archduke Karl gained a victory , what effect would that have on the
general course of events? It’s too late now when Vienna is occupied
by the French army!”
“What?","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"Occupied? Vienna occupied?”
“Not only occupied, but Bonaparte is at Schönbrunn, and the
count, our dear Count Vrbna, goes to him for orders.”
After the fatigues and impressions of the journey , his reception,
and especially after having dined, Bolk ónski felt that he could not
take in the full significance of the words he heard. “Count Lichtenfels was here this morning,” Bilíbin continued,
“and showed me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vienna
was fully described : Prince Murat et tout le trembleme nt... You see
that your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you can’t
be received as a savior .”
“Really I don’t care about that, I don’t care at all,” said Prince
Andrew , beginning to understand that his news of the battle before
Krems was really of small importance in view of such events as the
fall of Austria’ s capital. “How is it Vienna was taken? What of the
bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and Prince Auersper g? We heard
reports that Prince Auersper g was defending Vienna?” he said. “Prince Auersper g is on this, on our side of the river, and is
defending us—doing it very badly , I think, but still he is defending
us. But Vienna is on the other side. No, the bridge has not yet been
taken and I hope it will not be, for it is mined and orders have been
given to blow it up. Otherwise we shou ld long ago have been in the6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

bad quarter of an hour between two fires.”
“But still this does not mean that the campaign is over,” said
Prince Andrew . “Well, I think it is.","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"The bigwigs here think so too, but they daren’ t
say so. It will be as I said at the beginning of the campaign, it won’ t
be your skirmishing at Dürrenstein, or gunpowder at all, that will
decide the matter , but those who devised it,” said Bilíbin quoting one
of his own mots, releasing the wrinkles on his forehead, and pausing. “The only question is what will come of the meeting between the
Emperor Alexander and the King of Prussia in Berlin? If Prussia
joins the Allies, Austria’ s hand will be forced and there will be war. If not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of
the new Campo Formio are to be drawn up.”
“What an extraordinary genius!” Prince Andrew suddenly
exclaimed, clenchin g his small hand and striking the table with it,
“and what luck the man has!”
“Buonaparte?” said Bilíbin inquiringly , puckering up his forehead
to indicate  that he was about to say something witty . “Buonaparte?”
he repeate d, accentu ating the u: “I think, however , now that he lays
down laws for Austria at Schönbrunn, il faut lui faire grâce de l’u! *
I shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply Bonaparte!”
* “We must let him off the u!”
“But joking apart,” said Prince Andrew , “do you really think the
campaign is over?”
“This is what I think. Austria has been made a fool of, and she is
not used to it. She will retaliate. And she has been fooled in the first
place because her provinces have been pillaged—they say the Holy
Russian army loots terribly—her army is destroyed, her capital
taken, and all this for the beaux yeux  * of His Sardinian Majesty . And
therefore—this is between ourselves—I instinctively feel that we are
being deceived, my instinct tells me of negotiations with France and
projects for peace, a secret peace concluded separately .”
* Fine eyes. “Impossible!” cried Prince Andrew . “That would be too base.”
“If we live we shall see,” replied Bilíbin , his face again becoming
smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end. When Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay
down in a clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant
pillows, he felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was
far, far away from him. The allian ce with Prussia, Austria’ s
treachery , Bonaparte ’s new triumph, tomorrow’ s levee and parade,
and the audience with the Emperor Francis occupied his thoughts. He closed his eyes, and immediately a sound of cannonading, of
musketry and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears,
and now again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were
descending the hill, the French were firing, and he felt his heart
palpitating as he rode forward beside Schmidt with the bullets6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

living, as he had not done since childhood. He woke up... “Yes, that all happened!” he said, and, smiling happily to himself
like a child, he fell into a deep, youthful slumber .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

Next day he woke late. Recalling his recent impressions, the first
thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be
presented to the Emperor Francis; he remembered the Minister of
War, the polite Austrian adjutant, Bilíbin, and last night’ s
conversation. Having dressed for his attendance at court in full
parade uniform, which he had not worn for a long time, he went into
Bilíbin’ s study fresh, animated, and handsome, with his hand
bandaged. In the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps. With Princ e Hippolyte Kurágin, who was a secretary to the embassy ,
Bolkónski was already acquainted. Bilíbin introduced him to the
others. The gentlemen assembled at Bilíbin’ s were young, wealthy , gay
society men, who here, as in Vienna, formed a special set which
Bilíbin, their leader , called les nôtres. * This set, consist ing almost
exclusively of diplomats, evidently had its own interests which had
nothing to do with war or politics but related to high society , to
certain women, and to the official side of the service. These
gentlemen received Prince Andrew as one of themselves, an honor
they did not extend to many . From politeness and to start
conversation, they asked him a few questions about the army and the
battle, and then the talk went of f into merry jests and gossip. * Ours. “But the best of it was,” said one, telling of the misfortune of a
fellow diplomat, “that the Chancello r told him flatly that his
appointment to London was a promotion and that he was so to regard
it. Can you fancy the figure he cut?...”
“But the worst of it, gentlemen—I am giving Kurágin away to you
—is that that man suffers, and this Don Juan, wicked fellow , is
taking advantage of it!”
Prince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over
its arm. He began to laugh. “Tell me about that!” he said. “Oh, you Don Juan! You serpent!” cried several voices. “You, Bolkónski, don’t know ,” said Bilíbin turning to Prince
Andrew , “that all the atrocities of the French army (I nearly said of
the Russian army) are nothing compared to what this man has been
doing among the women!”
“La femme est la compagne de l’homme,”  * announ ced Prince
Hippolyte, and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated
legs. * “Woman is man’s companion.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 170/174Bilíbin and the rest of “ours” burst out laughing in Hippolyte’ s
face, and Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte, of whom—he had to
admit—he had almost been jealous on his wife’ s account, was the
butt of this set. “Oh, I must give you a treat,” Bilíbin  whispered to Bolkónski. “Kurágin is exquisite when he discusses  politics—you should see his
gravity!”
He sat down beside  Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began
talking to him about  politics. Prince Andrew and the others gathered
round these two. “The Berlin cabinet  cannot express a feeling of alliance,” began
Hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others, “without
expressing... as in its last note...","War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy.pdf"
"you understand... Besides, unless
His Maje sty the Emperor derogates from the principle of our
alliance... “Wait, I have not finished...” he said to Prince Andrew , seizing
him by the arm, “I believe that intervention will be stronger than
nonintervention. And...” he paused. “Finally one cannot impute the
nonreceipt of our dispatch of November 18. That is how it will end.”
And he released Bolkónski’ s arm to indicate that he had now quite
finished. “Demosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy
golden mouth!” said Bilíbin, and the mop of hair on his head moved
with satisfaction. Everybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone. He was
evidently distressed, and breathed painfully , but could not restrain
the wild laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features. “Well now, gentlemen,” said Bilíbin, “Bolkónski is my guest in
this house and in Brünn itself. I want to entertain him as far as I can,
with all the pleasures of life here. If we were in Vienna it would be
easy, but here, in this wretched Moravian hole, it is more difficult,
and I beg you all to help me. Brünn’ s attractions must be shown him. You can undertake the theater , I society, and you, Hippolyte, of
course the women.”
“We must let him see Amelie, she’s exquisite!” said one of “ours,”
kissing his finger tips. “In genera l we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane
interests,” said Bilíbin. “I shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality ,
gentlemen, it is already time for me to go,” replied Prince Andrew
looking at his watch. “Where to?”
“To the Emperor .”
“Oh! Oh! Oh!”
“Well, au revoir , Bolkónsk i! Au revoir , Prince! Come back  early
to dinner ,” cried several voices. “W e’ll take you in hand.”
“When speaking to the Emperor , try as far as you can to praise the
way that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated,” said
Bilíbin, accompanying him to the hall.6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

I can’ t,” replied Bolkónski, smiling. “Well, talk as much as you can, anyway . He has a passion for
giving audiences, but he does not like talking himself and can’t do it,
as you will see.”6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy

At the levee Prince Andrew stood among the Austrian officers as
he had been told to, and the Emperor Francis merely looked fixedly
into his face and just nodded to him with his long head. But after it
was over, the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously
informed Bolkónski that the Emperor desired to give him an
audience. The Emperor Francis received him standing in the middle
of the room. Before the conversation began Prince Andrew was
struck by the fact that the Emperor seemed confused and blushed as
if not knowing what to say . “Tell me, when did the battle begin?” he asked hurriedly . Prince Andrew replied. Then followed other questions just as
simple: “Was Kutúzov well? When had he left Krems?” and so on. The Emperor spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of
questions—the answ ers to these questio ns, as was only too evident,
did not interest him. “At what o’clock did the battle begin?” asked the Emperor . “I cannot inform Your Majesty at what o’clock the battle began at
the front, but at Dürrenstein, where I was, our attack began after five
in the afternoon,” replied Bolkónski growing more animated and
expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account,
which he had ready in his mind, of all he knew and had seen. But the
Emperor smiled and interrupted him. “How many miles?”
“From where to where, Your Majesty?”
“From Dürrenstein to Krems.”
“Three and a half miles, Your Majesty .”
“The French have abandoned the left bank?”
“According to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during
the night.”
“Is there suf ficient forage in Krems?”
“Forage has not been supplied to the extent...”
The Emperor interrupted him. “At what o’clock was General Schmidt killed?”
“At seven o’clock, I believe.”
“At seven o’clock? It’ s very sad, very sad!”
The Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed. Prince Andrew
withdrew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides. Everywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words. Yesterday’ s adjutan t reproached him for not having stayed at the
palace, and offered him his own house. The Minister of War came up
and congratulated him on the Maria Theresa Order of the third grade,
which the Emperor was conferring on him. The Empress’
chamberlain invited him to see Her Majesty . The archduchess also6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600-images.html 173/174wished to see him. He did not know whom to answer , and for a few
seconds collected his thoughts. Then the Russian ambassador took
him by the shoulde r, led him to the window , and began to talk to
him. Contrary to Bilíbin’ s forecast the news he had brought was
joyfully received. A thanksgiving service was arranged, Kutúzov was
awarded the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, and the whole army
received rewards. Bolkónski was invited everywhere, and had to
spend the whole morning calling on the principal Austrian
dignitaries. Between four and five in the afternoon, having made all
his calls, he was returning to Bilíbin’ s house thinking out a letter to
his father about the battle and his visit to Brünn. At the door he
found a vehicle half full of luggage. Franz, Bilíbin’ s man, was
dragging a portmanteau with some dif ficulty out of the front door .6/26/24, 2:13 PM The Project Gutenberg eBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
